You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze our resources and goals. i need to reach (3, 3) and i have 14 reds, 1 green, and 0 blues. i see that i'll need at least 1 blue to take the shortest path. you, on the other hand, have 14 blues, 1 green, and 0 reds.\\n\\nhere's an initial proposal:\\n\\n(2, 0): you give me a blue\\n(1, 0), (2, 1), and (3, 2): i give you a red\\n\\nthis way, i get the blue i need, and you get some reds to help you on your path. we can discuss and modify this proposal as needed.\\n\\nyour turn! what do you think? should we add or change any terms?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: it seems like there's been a mix-up in our resources. according to the game status, i have 14 blues, 1 green, and 0 reds, while you have 0 blues, 1 green, and 14 reds.\\n\\nconsidering the correct resources, your proposal seems reasonable. however, i'd like to modify it to benefit both of us more evenly.\\n\\nhere's my counter-proposal:\\n\\n(2, 0) and (3, 0): i give you a blue\\n(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 1): you give me a red\\n\\nin this revised proposal, i provide you with an additional blue to help you reach your goal, and in return, you provide me with more reds to cover my costs on the path.\\n\\nyour thoughts on this modification?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"thank you for correcting the resource mix-up.\\n\\nregarding your counter-proposal, i think it's a good starting point, but i'd like to make some adjustments to balance it out further.\\n\\nhere's my revised counter-proposal:\\n\\n(2, 0) and (3, 0): you give me a blue\\n(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), and (2, 2): i give you a red\\n\\ni removed (3, 1) from the list because it's not on the most direct path to your goal, and i added (2, 2) instead, which is a more crucial step for you. this way, we're both getting the resources we need to progress.\\n\\nadditionally, i'd like to clarify that we're committing to this exchange for the specified tiles only, and we'll reassess our resources and needs as we move forward.\\n\\nyour turn! what do you think of this revised proposal?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: turn: 3: i think your revised counter-proposal is a significant improvement, and i'm pleased to see that we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.\\n\\ni agree with your reasoning behind removing (3, 1) and adding (2, 2) instead. your suggested exchange should indeed help both of us progress towards our goals.\\n\\nregarding your clarification on the exchange being limited to the specified tiles, i completely agree. it's essential to have a clear understanding of our commitments and to reassess our resources and needs as we move forward.\\n\\nat this point, i'm willing to accept your revised proposal. however, i'd like to add one more condition to ensure we're both on the same page:\\n\\nif either of us needs to make any additional moves that aren't covered by this agreement, we'll enter into good-faith negotiations to find a mutually beneficial solution.\\n\\nwith that said, here's the revised proposal with the additional condition:\\n\\n(2, 0) and (3, 0): i give you a blue\\n(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), and (2, 2): you give me a red\\n\\nany future moves not covered by this agreement will be subject to additional negotiations in good faith.\\n\\nif you accept this, please respond, and we can finalize the agreement.\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i'm glad we've been able to work out a mutually beneficial proposal. i agree to the revised proposal with the additional condition.\\n\\nto confirm, the agreement is:\\n\\n(2, 0) and (3, 0): you give me a blue\\n(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), and (2, 2): i give you a red\\n\\nany future moves not covered by this agreement will be subject to additional negotiations in good faith.\\n\\ni'm happy to move forward with this agreement. \\n\\nagree\"}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
