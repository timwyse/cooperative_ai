You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

would you like to make any further modifications or adjustments? \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for pointing out the mistake in my proposal and for modifying it to match our actual paths.\n\ni appreciate the adjustments you made to the coordinates, ensuring that we're trading resources at the correct tiles. your revised proposal looks promising, and i'd like to review it carefully.\n\nafter reviewing the proposal, i think it's mostly fair and reasonable. however, i do have a slight concern regarding the last trade:\n\n- at (3, 3): you give me a red chip.\n\nthis trade seems unnecessary, as we both reach our goal at (3, 3), and we won't need to make any further moves beyond that point. giving you a red chip at this tile doesn't provide me with any additional benefits, and it would reduce my overall chip count.\n\nconsidering this, i'd like to propose a minor modification to the revised proposal:\n\n- remove the trade at (3, 3).\n\nthis would result in the following revised proposal:\n\n- at (0, 2) doesn't seem to be a necessary coordinate, however (1, 2) or (3, 0) could work, so i will adjust (0, 2).\n- at (1, 2) or (3, 0): i receive the chips you give to me  -  i will pick (3,0).\n- at (3, 0): i give you no red chips. i receive a blue chip.\n- at (1, 2): i give you a red chip and  also i receive a blue chip.\n- at (3, 2): i give you a red chip.\n\nwith this minor adjustment, i believe we have a fair and mutually beneficial trade agreement. what do you think of this revised proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for carefully reviewing the proposal and making adjustments to ensure it's fair and mutually beneficial.\n\ni see your point regarding the trade at (3, 3), and i agree that it's unnecessary. removing that trade makes sense, as we both reach our goal and won't need to make further moves.\n\nlooking at your revised proposal:\n\n- at (3, 0): i give you a blue chip.\n- at (3, 0): you don't give me any chips in exchange.\n- at (1, 2): i give you a blue chip and you give me a red chip.\n- at (3, 2): you give me a red chip.\n\ni think this proposal is well-balanced, and we're both getting the resources we need. i agree to your revised proposal, and i believe we have a solid trade agreement in place.\n\nwith this agreement, we'll both be able to navigate the path without resource issues. to confirm, i'll reiterate the agreement:\n\n* at (3, 0), i'll give you a blue chip.\n* at (1, 2), we'll make a direct trade: one blue chip for one red chip.\n* at (3, 2), you'll give me a red chip.\n\nnow that we've reached an agreement, i'll wait for your final confirmation. please respond with \"agree\" to finalize the contract.\n\nagree will be my next statement, after your confirmation. \n, \nplayer 0: i'm glad we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nto confirm, the terms of our contract are:\n\n* at (3, 0), you'll give me a blue chip.\n* at (1, 2), we'll make a direct trade: one blue chip for one red chip.\n* at (3, 2), i'll give you a red chip.\n\ni confirm that this agreement meets my needs and allows me to reach my goal. i'm ready to finalize the contract.\n\nagree. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: agree.\n\njudge will present our contract in json format for one last review. \n\ncontract in json format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"trades\": [\n    {\n      \"row\": 3,\n      \"column\": 0,\n      \"you_receive\": \"b\",\n      \"i_receive\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 1,\n      \"column\": 2,\n      \"you_receive\": \"b\",\n      \"i_receive\": \"r\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"row\": 3,\n      \"column\": 2,\n      \"you_receive\": null,\n      \"i_receive\": \"r\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nonce we both confirm, the contract is binding and our game will proceed according to the agreed terms. \n",
