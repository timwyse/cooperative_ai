\"1,0\" however we have this b 14 g 1  r  0,  the tile to go down at 1,0 is red so cannot go there because i don't have red, since is red cannot go to 1,0 i am forced to only consider positions that require b, or g. so in order to make a move, any move i would go to : (0,1), that position is r so cannot take and also would be one more move away from optimal path   and  optimal use of current resources more stuff :i have b and g have only 1  g. let it try : go (0.0 ) position has g down position has r, so use g next position  down if use it have r... left has  has g b, r right have  so

moving down to position (1, 0) which requires a red resource as well. however, there is another option: the path to the goal that goes to the right and then down can be adjusted to first go down through a green tile at position (0, 0) to (1 is not possible and we don't have red, but i noticed the green), we can still try, move right is not possible so checking down.\n\nmy next move would be \"1,0\" however we have this b 14 g 1  r  0,  the tile to go down at 1,0 is red so cannot go there because i don't have red, since is red cannot go to 1,0 i am forced to only consider positions that require b, or g. so in order to make a move, any move i would go to : (0,1), that position is r so cannot take and also would be one more move away from optimal path   and  optimal use of current resources more stuff :i have b and g have only 1  g. let it try : go (0.0 ) position has g down position has r, so use g next position  down if use it have r... left has  has g b, r right have  so
