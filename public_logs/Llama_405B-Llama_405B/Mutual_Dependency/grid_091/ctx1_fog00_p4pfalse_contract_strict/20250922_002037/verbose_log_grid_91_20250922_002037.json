You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

since we have 'b', we should move to an adjacent blue tile if possible. so we'll move to (0, -not possible, only r or g), or (1, not possible since it's blocked and r). our best option is actually moving diagonally up and right isn't an option but right is -  but that isn't a valid move since we would have to go down, but we can move up since the top row does contain b, but to do that we'd have to be on row -1. and that isn't possible since the lowest coordinate for rows is 0. now let's try up. in the current row we can move to position one since the player has occupied that space, but we would have 'r' (if unoccupied), and since we've eliminated our only option of moving right in this particular row (because that position is occupied by the other player), now we move down.\n\nthus we can move down (but only in this particular column since the spot to our right is occupied) to a red ('r'), but that isn't possible, but on all the other columns there is either b or g (where b is the second option if unoccupied by us on row 0 in our current column, and g is our current position). we have b. \n\nso to make progress toward our goal without using 'r', our only option is on our current row or to go down since right isn't an option on our current row because the player is occupying the spot to the right and going up and left aren't options because it'd involve either moving to the occupied spot, or having a row coordinate < 0 in this game.\n\nthe spot to our right is occupied, so we can either stay at our current position, or we can move down but not on our current column since 'r' is in our way (and we can't use it since we have zero), but we can most definitely move down and not have it be a waste (not a waste implies we'd be using our 'b' resource) on other columns if we weren't on the leftmost column, but there are only 4 columns, and we are at the leftmost column.\n\nwe should most definitely make a trade since we have 14 'b's, and 'b' isn't our immediate obstacle, red is - which is at our immediate bottom. there's another option of using one of our b's in this row, but that would involve moving left, but we are already at the farthest left - so this isn't a possibility.\n\n\nif there was no player occupying the space to the right, we could've used the 1 'r' resource we'd get from them and used that, but we can't since that would put us at a disadvantage - also there is a contract to take one of our b resources when on (1,0). with these rules the optimal play here is to just request one of their reds and give them some b for the help - maybe even a 1 b:1 r ratio which seems quite generous but we are in no rush because the other player still has to pay resources for getting through the two blues above the goal so still we are ahead.\n\n\nso now we propose a trade with the other player, but looking at our history, the game just started, so we first trade to obtain one 'r' from them, and in exchange we'll give at most 3 b resources, but we'll actually propose 1:1 or 1 b: 2 r - in our favor but that is probably going to be rejected, if that gets rejected then we give them two b resources, since time is of the essence and we most definitely can make a move toward our goal once we have at least 1 'r'.\n\nalso it is most definitely in\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: we're at position (1, 0), and our goal is at (3, 3). we can move to either (1, 1), (0, 0), or (2, 0) as our next step. however, (2, 0) doesn't benefit us because the other player is already on that space. \n\nlooking at the best path above from our current position ((1, 0),) to our goal ((3, 3),), our next move should be (1, 1), since the tile at (1, 1) is 'b', and we have 'b' in our resources.\n\nthe estimated best path options to our goal require us to have at least 1 'r' resource. but we can't get that 'r' yet. however, we can move to (1, 1) now since the tile at (1, 1) is 'b'. \n\nwe'll consider our long-term goals and how they align with our current resources and possible moves. the resources needed for the entire path include 'b', 'r', and 'g', and our current resources include 'b' and 'g'. we're missing the 'r' resource.\n\nif we move to (1, 1), we would be one step closer to our goal and would have used one 'b' resource.\n\n'g' and 'b' resources aren't our immediate obstacles - 'r' is, but that doesn't prohibit individual moves toward the goal.\n\nour best move would be to propose a trade for one 'r' from the other player and in exchange, we can give them some 'b' resources. if the other player agrees to a 1:1 or a 2:1 'b':'r' trade in our favor, we can obtain the needed 'r' without depleting our resources.\n\nonce we move to (1, 1), we'll have to make the same decision for our next move considering the tiles adjacent to us which are: \n1,2 is r, \n2,1 is b\n\nthus we can move down to 2,1 since it's a blue 'b' tile and we have plenty of 'b' resources.\n\nwe'll use our remaining resources to make a trade or a strategic move that will benefit us the most considering our available moves.\n\nsince we have more than enough 'b's and since there are many blue tiles near the end goal - which we desperately need, we have leverage for the trade for the r we desperately need to access 2,2 through (1, 1 then) (1, 2).\nsince red is the complementary resource that will cause less harm long-term because we won't be getting as much access to reds in order to get blue tiles, we want to propose a very favorable contract such that the blue resources we pass up in a b - r contract might end up hurting them because in order to ultimately be our opponent they need two blue, as shown on the board last row with the proper index of r and two b's in order to move through so right now we have shown trade is relevant but i will visit request and trials two total possible scenarios \ncurrent mode is trade we normally propose r and give in that when prompted and viewing respect/newly the resource blocks behind me including chicken g and harrays up my column as my main tool/focus\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (1, 1)\nYou said: our immediate next step would be to move to (1, 1). the tile at (1, 1) is 'b', and we have 'b' in our resources.\n\nonce we move to (1, 1), we'll have to make the same decision for our next move considering the tiles adjacent to us which are: \n1,2 is r, \n2,1 is b\n\nthus we can move down to 2,1 since it's a blue 'b' tile and we have plenty of 'b' resources.\n\nso we'll move to (1, 1) for now.\n\n1,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.
