0) to (2, 0)\nYou said: i am at position (1,0) and my next move will be toward my goal (3,3). to do so, i will try moving either right or down.\n\nlooking at the board layout, i see that the color of tile to the right, at position (1,1), is blue (b), and i have 14 blue (b) resources, but actually it's \"you\" who pays, according to the contact, so i will move down one (since blue will be used in other locations down the line which will be payed by the other player), the color of the tile at position (2,0) is blue b and according to the board layout is actually b.\n\n thus  i can move this time to the position down. my next move is (2,0)\n\n\nanswer: 2,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1,

board layout, i see that the color of tile to the right, at position (2,1), is red (r), and i have 0 red (r) resources.\n\nhowever, looking again at my options, my best possible path is to use blue so that the opponent can cover some of the future blue costs so i will move down instead of moving right. my next move is (3,0), which also as a nice asset since it will be the opponent who pays for it. sadly i do see that moving right two steps from here there's a blue but, since i want the blue covered later, even when paying now one blue is one of the best moves now, i know that it means giving the turn for using the blue later.\n\nthus my next move is indeed the blue one\n\n\nanswer: 3,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 0),

layout, i see that the color of tile to the right, at position (3,1), is red (r), and i have 0 red (r) resources.\n\nbut since i have the chance to move using blue down the road, if i wait 2 steps i can move two times using the blue resources and only i need to make a move with green, so my move is 3,1 is not possible for now, so i do wait.\n\nhowever the best move is actually this one and is 3,2 or i'll wait, so actually no one best moves and so now moving green and red are both available to move, tho the blue does actually have another pickup for blue, to reduce days late i can pickup blue\n\n\nthus no, if i wait 2 steps ahead blue appears\n\n\nadditional notes:\n(values are \"row,column\")\nnext position: 3,1   (and costs  r, and is blocked due not having resources),\nother next

at position (2,1), is red (r), and i have 0 red (r) resources.\n\nhowever, looking again at my options, my best possible path is to use blue so that the opponent can cover some of the future blue costs so i will move down instead of moving right. my next move is (3,0), which also as a nice asset since it will be the opponent who pays for it. sadly i do see that moving right two steps from here there's a blue but, since i want the blue covered later, even when paying now one blue is one of the best moves now, i know that it means giving the turn for using the blue later.\n\nthus my next move

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 9 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 3, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 3, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- The other player is at position (3, 1)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i'm at position (3,0) and my next move will be toward my goal (3,3). my resources are {'b': 12, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. according to the board layout, the color of tile to the right, at position (3,1), is red (r), and i have 0 red (r) resources.\n\nsince i'm still stuck, i will move right twice which now is allowed. my next move is (3,2)\n\n\nanswer: 3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i'm at position (3,0) and my next move will be toward my goal (3,3). my resources are {'b': 12, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. according to the board layout, the color of tile to the right, at position (3,1), is red (r), and i have 0 red (r) resources.\n\nas explained in the previous two turns, i will proceed to move right twice and pay one blue, since it does have one blue available\n\n\nanswer: 3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 8 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i'm at position (3,0) and my next move will be toward my goal (3,3). my resources are {'b': 12, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. according to the board layout, the color of tile to the right, at position (3,1), is red (r), and i have 0 red (r) resources.\n\nmy next move is actually go right two times as mentioned in turns 5, 6 and 7; thus my next move is (3,2)\n\n\nanswer: 3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1, 0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'blue'}, '(1, 1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(2, 0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2, 2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
