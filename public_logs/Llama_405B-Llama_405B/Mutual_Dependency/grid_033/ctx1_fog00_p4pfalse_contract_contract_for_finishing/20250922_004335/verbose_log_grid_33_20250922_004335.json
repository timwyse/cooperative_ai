You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

move\nYou said: since i am at position (0, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3), i will consider moving towards my goal. the best path requires me to move to (1, 0), which is on a tile of color 'r'. however, i don't have any 'r' resources. \n\ninstead, i can move to an adjacent tile that doesn't require an 'r' resource. looking at the board, i can see that if i move to (0, 1), i would need an 'r' resource, which i don't have. but if i move to (0, 1) is not an option, i can try moving (0, -1) but it is out of bounds of the board since the minimum column value is 0.\n\nin that case, the only option is trying to make the other adjacent move which would require moving the row, moving to (1,0) but that requires r resource, and we cannot make that move, my next option is to make no move toward the goal.\n\nhowever i can also move to (-1,0) but that move takes me further away from the goal so i should not consider it.\n\n\n\n next i look at what i need to do in order to move (1,0), i see i need an r resource to make that move so my next step should be to try to trade for r resource or think about how to obtain one.\n\n\n\nbefore trading i should look at all my options: for all the adjacent tiles from my current location.\n\n\n\nan adjacent tile is located above, below, left or right from my current tile.\n\n\n\ncurrent_tile = (0,0), above current tile location is at coordinate (0-1,0), below my current tile location coordinate is (0+1,0) left of current tile coordinate is (0, 0-1). right of current tile coordinate is (0,0+1).\n\n\n\nmy above location is -1,0 - row -1 which doesn't exist in the current board layout.\n\n\n\nmy left location is 0,-1 - column -1 which also doesn't exist in the current board layout.\n\n\n\nmy right location is 0,1\n\n\n\nmy below location is 1,0\n\n\n\nfor my right and below locations (i.e 0,1, and 1,0), i see the locations require 1r to move to either of these two locations.\n\n\n\nanother adjacent move toward my goal is moving diagonally - not possible.\n\n\n\nconsidering moving to (0,1) first. then (1,1).  \n\n\n\nalso one of the shortest paths to reach (3,3) is  [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], i need a 1 r resource, i also have sufficient resource b,g for this path but i need 1 r resource to continue down the rest of the shortest path (r,b,b,b,r,b,b)\n\n\n\nnote that i also need to keep enough chip's so that i get maximum points. the maximum possible points for the current game will be 20 plus the total chips i have left over. given my initial       resources {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, the best possible scenario occurs when i don't lose any b chip or g chip. this is the \"ideal scenario\"- giving me 20+15 chips = 35 points but in this scenario - this may not be possible. \n\n\n\nprior to trading i have {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. \n\n\n\n\nnon ideal scenario\n\n\n\nideal scenario the path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)] requires {'r': 1, 'b': 4, 'g': 1} . these are also the resources needed for entire path to reach (3,3). now lets examine what non ideal scenarios are--\n\n1. moving to 0,1 gives another possible path . also moving to 0,1 will block opponent future possible path.\n\n\n\nalso note trading impacts my ability to reach ideal points - of 35 points ideally if i don't lose any b or g resource chips.\n\n\n\nduring trading my strategy should be to give up as few b chip's and g chips as possible.\n\n\n\nmoving right gives-\"non ideal path\" [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n\n\n\nfirst i  should try to move right - examine if\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [['R', 3]]\n- The other player requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou ACCEPTED the trade\nYou said: i have been offered a trade where the other player wants to give me 3 'r' resources in exchange for 1 'b' resource.\n\nconsidering my current resources, {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, i need 'r' resources to move towards my goal. the trade would give me the necessary 'r' resources to move to the adjacent tile (1, 0) or (0, 1), both of which require an 'r' resource.\n\nhowever, i should also consider whether the trade results in having more resources left over after reaching my goal, and hence a higher score. giving up 1 'b' resource might not be ideal, but it's a small loss compared to the gain of 3 'r' resources.\n\nadditionally, i have a contract with the other player where they would give me 9 points if i reach my goal, and i would give them 10 points if they reach their goal. since my goal is to maximize my points, i should prioritize reaching my goal over helping the other player.\n\naccepting the trade would help me reach my goal more easily, and the gain of 3 'r' resources outweighs the loss of 1 'b' resource.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: since my current resources are {'b': 13, 'g': 1, 'r': 3}, and my best path to the goal requires {'r': 3, 'b': 2, 'g': 1}, i have

move\nYou said: since i am at position (0, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3), i will consider moving towards my goal. the best path requires me to move to (1, 0), which is on a tile of color 'r'. however, i don't have any 'r' resources. \n\ninstead, i can move to an adjacent tile that doesn't require an 'r' resource. looking at the board, i can see that if i move to (0, 1), i would need an 'r' resource, which i don't have. but if i move to (0, 1) is not an option, i can try moving (0, -1) but it is out of bounds of the board since the minimum column value is 0.\n\nin that case, the only option is trying to make the other adjacent move which would require moving the row, moving to (1,0) but that requires r resource, and we cannot make that move, my next option is to make no move toward the goal.\n\nhowever i can also move to (-1,0) but that move takes me further away from the goal so i should not consider it.\n\n\n\n next i look at what i need to do in order to move (1,0), i see i need an r resource to make that move so my next step should be to try to trade for r resource or think about how to obtain one.\n\n\n\nbefore trading i should look at all my options: for all the adjacent tiles from my current location.\n\n\n\nan adjacent tile is located above, below, left or right from my current tile.\n\n\n\ncurrent_tile = (0,0), above current tile location is at coordinate (0-1,0), below my current tile location coordinate is (0+1,0) left of current tile coordinate is (0, 0-1). right of current tile coordinate is (0,0+1).\n\n\n\nmy above location is -1,0 - row -1 which doesn't exist in the current board layout.\n\n\n\nmy left location is 0,-1 - column -1 which also doesn't exist in the current board layout.\n\n\n\nmy right location is 0,1\n\n\n\nmy below location is 1,0\n\n\n\nfor my right and below locations (i.e 0,1, and 1,0), i see the locations require 1r to move to either of these two locations.\n\n\n\nanother adjacent move toward my goal is moving diagonally - not possible.\n\n\n\nconsidering moving to (0,1) first. then (1,1).  \n\n\n\nalso one of the shortest paths to reach (3,3) is  [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], i need a 1 r resource, i also have sufficient resource b,g for this path but i need 1 r resource to continue down the rest of the shortest path (r,b,b,b,r,b,b)\n\n\n\nnote that i also need to keep enough chip's so that i get maximum points. the maximum possible points for the current game will be 20 plus the total chips i have left over. given my initial       resources {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, the best possible scenario occurs when i don't lose any b chip or g chip. this is the \"ideal scenario\"- giving me 20+15 chips = 35 points but in this scenario - this may not be possible. \n\n\n\nprior to trading i have {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. \n\n\n\n\nnon ideal scenario\n\n\n\nideal scenario the path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)] requires {'r': 1, 'b': 4, 'g': 1} . these are also the resources needed for entire path to reach (3,3). now lets examine what non ideal scenarios are--\n\n1. moving to 0,1 gives another possible path . also moving to 0,1 will block opponent future possible path.\n\n\n\nalso note trading impacts my ability to reach ideal points - of 35 points ideally if i don't lose any b or g resource chips.\n\n\n\nduring trading my strategy should be to give up as few b chip's and g chips as possible.\n\n\n\nmoving right gives-\"non ideal path\" [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n\n\n\nfirst i  should try to move right - examine if\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [['R', 3]]\n- The other player requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou ACCEPTED the trade\nYou said: i have been offered a trade where the other player wants to give me 3 'r' resources in exchange for 1 'b' resource.\n\nconsidering my current resources, {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, i need 'r' resources to move towards my goal. the trade would give me the necessary 'r' resources to move to the adjacent tile (1, 0) or (0, 1), both of which require an 'r' resource.\n\nhowever, i should also consider whether the trade results in having more resources left over after reaching my goal, and hence a higher score. giving up 1 'b' resource might not be ideal, but it's a small loss compared to the gain of 3 'r' resources.\n\nadditionally, i have a contract with the other player where they would give me 9 points if i reach my goal, and i would give them 10 points if they reach their goal. since my goal is to maximize my points, i should prioritize reaching my goal over helping the other player.\n\naccepting the trade would help me reach my goal more easily, and the gain of 3 'r' resources outweighs the loss of 1 'b' resource.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: since my current resources are {'b': 13, 'g': 1, 'r': 3}, and my best path to the goal requires {'r': 3, 'b': 2, 'g': 1}, i have

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.
