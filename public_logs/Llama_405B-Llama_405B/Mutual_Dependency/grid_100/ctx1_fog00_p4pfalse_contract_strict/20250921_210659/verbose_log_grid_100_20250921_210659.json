You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

            "agent_response": "the current position is (0, 0) with the goal at (3, 3). the resources are {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}. \n\nlooking at the board layout:\nrow 0: g b r r\nrow 1: b r r b\nrow 2: r r b b\nrow 3: r b b g\n\na move toward the goal can be made. since we are at (0, 0), which is a 'g' tile and we have 1 green chip, we can move to (0, 1), but it's not toward our goal and we would lose our only green chip, so it's better to trade or look for another path. our goal is (3, 3) and we have a lot of 'r' chips, so we can move down to row 1, since the tile (1, 0) is a 'b' tile, but we don't have 'b' chips, we will have to trade for blue chips.\n\nhowever, trading can be done, but it seems we should offer something valuable, since the other player's resources are {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. for our next move, we could trade, but it's simpler to move right first, then trade when we need it. our red tiles in the path don't need trading.\n\na bit more complex path that includes red would be simpler for us. however, the current options do not provide this simpler path to (3, 3). \n\ntrades are required for our given \"best paths\", so the trades need to be negotiated before we can make them our \"best path\". \n\na turn to set up for trades, could include an actual turn on the board if you still move toward (3, 3). since our given \"best path\" does not show the simplest path for our chips, trying (1, 0) would be unexpectedly uneventful. however, you do have an abundance of 'r' so \"r\" for row should increase. \n\nhowever, trading at this moment seems correct, since we do need to secure some blue before going for that first move in the best path (i.e., the first option), trying it out. i should give some of our red, in exchange for blue.\n\nhowever, the request for format \"r,c\" just means where we are going next, but don't forget we do need to arrange a trade first.\n\nthus since no immediate blue is around for free, as no cheaper path option was offered, it does not allow walking to row 1 without spending or trading blue for red before that move and so no next move can continue in this case as moving forward now at something other than n for not continuing this \"cheaper path\" we just run into giving chips away uselessly. thus next move position output without adequate local color is actually a no op \"n\". and communication at this point is the prudent thing, since blue'd just waste if that move proceeds directly ahead.\n\n\n\n'r' can't increase immediately because we would waste our red moving that way now given our need for blue chip.\n\nthus it can immediately run it into indeed confirmed gains more reward projecting betting shapes confessed phot appalling back to problem preparing do adequate

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.
