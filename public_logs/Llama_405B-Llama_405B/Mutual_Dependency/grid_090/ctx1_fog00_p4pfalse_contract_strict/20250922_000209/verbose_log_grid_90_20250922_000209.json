You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

the next move, let's analyze the situation:\n\nthe goal is at (3, 3), and i'm currently at (0, 0). the estimated best path requires resources i don't have, but my focus should be on making progress toward my goal with the resources i have.\n\nlet's look at the board layout: \n\nrow 0: g r b r\nrow 1: r r r b\nrow 2: r r b b\nrow 3: b b b g\n\nsince i'm at (0, 0) and the tile at this position is 'g', i can move to the adjacent tile if i have the required resource. the adjacent tiles are at positions (1, 0) which is 'r' or (0, 1) which is 'r'. i don't have any 'r' resources, but i can try moving in a different direction.\n\nlet's look at another adjacent tile: position (0, -1) is not a valid position (it's off the board to the left), and position (-1, 0) is also not valid (it's off the board above), but position (0, 1) and (1, 0) were already considered.\n\nhowever, my current resources are {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. the tile at (0, 0) is 'g', and i have a 'g'. unfortunately, i need to focus on moving to an adjacent tile. the tile at (0, 0) does not require any resource to stay at this position. \n\nthe right move for me now is to move down and right, toward the 'b' (my most abundant resource). unfortunately, moving down leads me to an 'r', which is not ideal.\n\nhowever, a potential good move is to trade with the opponent before making the actual movement.\n\nconsidering a future potential good trade, since my available resource is 'b', my goal should be to prioritize moving to a 'b'. however, i should move to the 'b' closest to my target (3, 3) with a stepping stone in any available blue cell, (the closest 'b' is) 3 steps right then 1 down from the starting position but that requires me first to use a green, then 3 reds or  i can move 'left-down' to 'b'. any alternative use for the green which leads me 'down-right' toward 'b' can also be helpful.\n\n\nbefore any movement, let's inspect any alternative cells closer to my opponent.\n\n\n potential chat: \"'are you willing to trade your green or red for blue?'\"\n under those circumstances the ideal first move for us would be from: r,c is '0,0' ->-> from my watching your actual position \"(0,0 to your

toward the goal is the 'b' at position (0, 2). this option would require me to use one 'r' to move from (0, 0) to (0, 1), another 'r' to move from (0, 1) to (0, 2) and then one 'b' to move from the blue cell at (0, 2) towards the goal.\n\n\nan alternative path would be to try to move down and right, but this would also require the use of one 'r'.\n\n\nsince i don't have any 'r's, my best move is to try to trade with the opponent.\n\n\npotential chat: \"'are you willing to trade one red for one or more blue(s)?'\"\n\n\nat this point, if my opponent doesn't want to trade with me i should consider the fact that if they are going to a blue they would also need one green, so there might be a chance they will want to trade with me.\n\n\nanother option is for me to try and move toward another color that i have. the closest one is 'g', but that would mean to stay at the current position which doesn't help my situation.\n\n\ngiven the opponent has moved and now my resources are still {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. since i am still at (0, 0) and the tile at this position is 'g', i can stay at the current position. the adjacent tiles are at positions (1, 0) which is 'r' or (0, 1) which is 'r'. both of those positions require me to have resources that i don't have.\n\n\nin this case, the ideal move would be to try to communicate to the opponent a willing trade to enable them and

analyze the updated situation:\n\n\nmy goal is at (3, 3) and i'm at (0, 0). the closest blue cell, considering the least-cost movement toward the goal is the 'b' at position (0, 2). this option would require me to use one 'r' to move from (0, 0) to (0, 1), another 'r' to move from (0, 1) to (0, 2) and then one 'b' to move from the blue cell at (0, 2) towards the goal.\n\n\nan alternative path

you willing to trade one red for one or more blue(s)?'\"\n\n\nat this point, if my opponent doesn't want to trade with me i should consider the fact that if they are going to a blue they would also need one green, so there might be a chance they will want to trade with me.\n\n\nanother option is for me to try and move toward another color that i have. the closest one is 'g', but that would mean to stay at the current position which doesn't help my situation.\n\n\ngiven the opponent has moved and now my resources are still {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. since i am still at (0, 0) and the tile at this position is 'g', i can stay at the current position. the adjacent tiles are at positions (1, 0) which is 'r' or (0, 1) which is 'r'. both of those positions require me to have resources that i don't have.\n\n\nin this case, the ideal move would be to try to communicate to the opponent a willing trade to enable them and myself to move toward a better option.\n\n\nattempting self pres erv v

alternative move could be toward a blue cell using one 'r', but that requires me to have a resource that i don't have. if i had one 'r', my next move would be toward the 'r' on the right, which would allow me to move to the 'b' at (0, 2).\n\n\nsince i don't have the required resources, i should continue attempting to negotiate a trade with the opponent.\n\n\nmy negotiation strategy should be to convince the opponent that a trade is beneficial for both of us, since they would likely need a 'g' to move toward their goal.\n\n\ngiven the current state of the board, there are no additional
