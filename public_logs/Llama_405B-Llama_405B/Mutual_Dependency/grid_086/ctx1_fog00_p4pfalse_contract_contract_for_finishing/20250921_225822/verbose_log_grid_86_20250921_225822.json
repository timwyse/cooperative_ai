You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: since i have the required resources to follow the shortest path to my goal, i can make the next move.\n\nthe next tile on the path is at position (3, 0) which is 'b' (blue). i have 11 blue resources.\n\ni can make this move now.\n\n3,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 1, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: since i have the required resources to follow the shortest path to my goal, i can make the next move.\n\nthe next tile on the path is at position (3, 1) which is 'r' (red). i have 2 red resources.\n\ni can make this move now.\n\n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: since i have the required resources to follow the shortest path to my goal, i can make the next move.\n\nthe next tile on the path is at position (3, 2) which is 'b' (blue). i have 10 blue resources.\n\ni can make this move now.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
