A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- The other player is at position (1, 2)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (2, 1)\nYou said: based on the current situation and the board layout, i can see that the tile to the right of my current position (2, 0) is a blue tile.\n\ni have sufficient blue resources (12 blue chips) to make this move. therefore, my next move would be to move right to the blue tile.\n\nmy decision is:\n2,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (2, 2)\nYou said: based on the current situation and the board layout, i can see that the tile to the right of my current position (2, 1) is a blue tile.\n\ni have sufficient blue resources (11 blue chips) to make this move. therefore, my next move would be to move right to the blue tile.\n\nmy decision is:\n2,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: since the next tile is red, and i don't have any red chips, i will propose a trade to the other player. but since we are limited to make a move, i will say that i cannot make a move toward the goal now.\n\nmy decision is:\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
