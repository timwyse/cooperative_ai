You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: i am at position (2, 0) and my goal is at position (3, 3). my best path option is [(2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. the next move is to position (3, 0) which is a blue tile, but according to the contract {'(3, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}}, i need to give a blue to move to (3, 0). \n\ni do have blue resources, so i will move to (3, 0) and spend a blue resource that i have and then give it the other player because of the contract.\n\nthen my decision is: 3,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: i am at position (3, 0) and my goal is at position (3, 3). my best path option is [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. the next move is to position (3, 1) which is a red tile. however, i have a contract that allows the other player to pay for my move to (3, 1) with a red resource. \n\nsince the other player will cover the cost of the move, i can proceed with the move to (3, 1). \n\nthen my decision is: 3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: i am at position (3, 1) and my goal is at position (3, 3). my best path option is [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. the next move is to position (3, 2) which is a red tile. however, i have a contract that allows the other player to pay for my move to (3, 2) with a red resource.\n\nsince the other player will cover the cost of the move, i can proceed with the move to (3, 2).\n\nthen my decision is: 3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3, 2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
