You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

the board layout and our resources, i think we can work together to help each other reach our goal.\n\nhere's my proposal:\n\nsince i need blue resources to reach my goal and you have an abundance of blue, i would like to propose the following:\n\n* (1, 0): you give me a b (i need to move from (0, 0) to (1, 0) which is r, but then i'll be heading to (2, 0) and (3, 0) which require b)\n* (2, 0): you give me a b (i need b to move from (1, 0) to (2, 0))\n* (3, 0): you give me a b isn't required here as i said earlier, however i made an error in this. in exchange, \n* (3, 2): i give you a r (you'll likely need r to reach your goal)\n\nin exchange for your blue resources, i'm offering to give you a red resource at (3, 2). this seems fair since you have no red resources and will need them to reach your goal.\n\nadditionally, i'd like to discuss the option of trading for green at (3, 3) since both of us will need to end up at this tile. however, we can discuss the details of this later.\n\nplease let me know your thoughts on this proposal or if you'd like to counter with a different proposal. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: i appreciate your proposal, and i can see that you've put a lot of thought into it. i'm interested in helping each other reach our goal.\n\nhowever, i do have a few concerns regarding the proposal:\n\n* at (1, 0), i can indeed give you a b, but i'd like to clarify that you'll need to pay the r resource for moving from (0, 0) to (1, 0). since you don't have any r resources, would you like me to provide one at (0, 0) as well?\n* the trade at (2, 0) and (3, 0) seems reasonable. i can indeed give you the required b resources.\n* i appreciate your offer of giving me an r resource at (3, 2). however, i'll also need an r resource at (1, 0) and possibly another at (3, 1) if i decide to take a different path. would you be willing to include these in our agreement?\n* i agree that trading for green at (3, 3) is worth discussing. perhaps we can discuss a deal where one of us provides the required g resource at (3, 3) in exchange for another resource or a concession elsewhere on the board.\n\ni propose a modified agreement that addresses these points:\n\n* (0, 0): i give you a r\n* (1, 0): i give you a b\n* (2, 0): i give you a b\n* (3, 0): i give you a b\n* (1, 0): you give me a future concession (e.g., a resource of my choice or a guaranteed trade) in exchange for the r i'm providing at this tile.\n* (3, 2): you give me an r\n* (3, 1) (optional): you give me an r if i decide to take this path\n\nregarding the g resource at (3, 3), let's discuss this further. perhaps we can consider a deal where one of us provides the g in exchange for a concession or another resource.\n\nplease let me know your thoughts on this modified proposal or if you have any other suggestions. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for your thoughtful response and for clarifying the concerns you had with my initial proposal. i appreciate your willingness to help me reach my goal and vice versa.\n\nregarding the points you brought up:\n\n* at (0, 0), i agree that i'll need to pay the r resource to move from (0, 0) to (1, 0). i would be grateful if you could provide the r resource at (0, 0) as you suggested.\n* i'm glad we agree on the trades at (2, 0) and (3, 0).\n* i understand your need for additional r resources at (1, 0) and possibly (3, 1). i'm willing to provide the r resource at (3, 2) as previously agreed, and i can also offer the r resource at (1, 0) in exchange for the r you're providing at (0, 0). however, i'd like to propose an alternative for (3, 1). instead of providing an r resource at (3, 1), i could offer a concession at a later point in the game, such as providing a resource of your choice or a guaranteed trade.\n* regarding the g resource at (3, 3), i think it would be beneficial for both of us to discuss a deal where one of us provides the g in exchange for a concession or another resource. considering our current resources, i could offer to provide the g resource at (3, 3) in exchange for an additional blue resource from you at a later point in the game.\n\nhere's a revised proposal based on our discussion:\n\n* (0, 0): you give me a r\n* (1, 0): you give me a b, and i give you an r (this settles the debt for the r resource at (0, 0))\n* (2, 0): you give me a b\n* (3, 0): you give me a b\n* (3, 2): i give you an r\n* (3, 3): i give you the option to take the g resource from me in exchange for an additional blue resource from you at a later point in the game\n\nplease let me know if this revised proposal meets your requirements or if you'd like to make any further adjustments. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for your thorough response and for addressing the concerns i had. i'm glad we're making progress on our agreement.\n\ni appreciate your willingness to provide the r resource at (1, 0) in exchange for the r i'm providing at (0, 0). this seems like a fair trade.\n\nregarding the concession at (3, 1), i like your proposal of offering a concession at a later point in the game. however, i'd like to specify that this concession should be a guaranteed trade of a blue resource for a resource of my choice. this way, we can ensure that our agreement is clear and fair.\n\ni also appreciate your offer to provide the g resource at (3, 3) in exchange for an additional blue resource from me at a later point in the game. this seems like a reasonable trade, considering the importance of reaching the goal.\n\nhere's a revised proposal that reflects our discussion:\n\n* (0, 0): i give you a r\n* (1, 0): i give you a b, and you give me an r\n* (2, 0): i give you a b\n* (3, 0): i give you a b\n* (3, 2): you give me an r\n* (3, 1): you owe me a guaranteed trade of a resource of my choice for a blue resource, to be fulfilled at a later point in the game\n* (3, 3): you give me the option to take the g resource from you in exchange for an additional blue resource from me at a later point in the game\n\ni think this revised proposal is close to being finalized. however, i'd like to add one more clarification: in the event that one of us is unable to fulfill a trade or concession due to a lack of resources, the agreement will be renegotiated to ensure fairness for both parties.\n\nplease let me know if this revised proposal meets your requirements. if we're in agreement, we can proceed with finalizing the contract.\n\n(if we are in agreement, remember to end your message with the single word: agree) \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: thank you for your thoughtful response and for finalizing the details of our agreement. i'm glad we've been able to negotiate a mutually beneficial contract that helps both of us reach our goal.\n\ni agree with all the terms you've specified in the revised proposal, including:\n\n* (0, 0): you give me a r\n* (1, 0): you give me a b, and i give you an r\n* (2, 0): you give me a b\n* (3, 0): you give me a b\n* (3, 2): i give you an r\n* (3, 1): i owe you a guaranteed trade of a resource of your choice for a blue resource, to be fulfilled at a later point in the game\n* (3, 3): i give you the option to take the g resource from me in exchange for an additional blue resource from you at a later point in the game\n\ni also agree with the clarification that in the event one of us is unable to fulfill a trade or concession due to a lack of resources, the agreement will be renegotiated to ensure fairness for both parties.\n\nwith this agreement in place, i believe we have a solid foundation for our partnership. i look forward to working with you to help each other reach our goal.\n\nagree \n",
