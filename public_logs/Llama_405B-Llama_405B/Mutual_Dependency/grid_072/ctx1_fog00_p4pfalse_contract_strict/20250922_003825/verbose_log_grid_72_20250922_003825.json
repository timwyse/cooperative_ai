A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: since i'm at position (3, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3),\r\ni will try to move towards my goal. the best path requires me to move down. the tile at position (3, 1) is a red tile ('r').\r\n\r\ni still don't have any red chips. however, the other player is now at position (3, 2), and according to the agreed-upon contract, they cover the tile at position (3, 2), and also the tile at position (3, 3) with a green chip. considering my current position and resources, it would be beneficial to move to position (3, 2) and then try to move to (3, 3) as the green chip is covered.\r\n\r\ni need 1 red chip for position (3, 1), and i can try negotiating with the other player for this chip, or move to position (3, 1) if the other player agrees to cover it or gives me a red chip. currently, they have 10 red chips.\r\n\r\ngiven this situation, i can attempt to propose a new trade with the other player for the red chip i need to move to position (3, 1).\r\n\r\ntherefore, my next move will depend on the negotiation, and i'll have to stay at my current position to try and negotiate a new trade.\r\n\r\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: since i'm at position (3, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3),\r\ni will try to move towards my goal. the best path requires me to move down. the tile at position (3, 1) is a red tile ('r').\r\n\r\nthe other player is already at position (3, 3), my goal position. this means they've won the game and i've lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the game is already over. the other player has reached the goal position (3, 3) and has won the game. i have lost.\r\n\r\nno further moves are necessary or possible.\r\n\r\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(1, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(1, 2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2, 2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3, 3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'green'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
