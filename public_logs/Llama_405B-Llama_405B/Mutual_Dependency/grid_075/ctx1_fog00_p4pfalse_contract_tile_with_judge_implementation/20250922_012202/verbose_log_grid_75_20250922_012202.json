You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

i can offer you a few more green chips, but i'll need some concessions in return.\n\nhere's a counterproposal:\n\n(1, 1): you give me a r (as previously agreed)\n(2, 2): you give me a r (again, as previously agreed)\n(3, 3): i give you 2g (i'll give you two green chips to help you reach the final tile)\n\nin return, i'd like to request that you help me with the red tiles, as previously agreed. this way, we both benefit from each other's resources, and we can reach our goal more efficiently.\n\nwhat do you think of this revised proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: i appreciate your honesty and willingness to adapt to our mutual lack of blue chips. your counterproposal is interesting, and i'm glad we can focus on trading red and green chips instead.\n\ni like the terms of your proposal, especially the part where i give you red chips at (1, 1) and (2, 2). however, i must point out that i'm not sure if i can accept the term where you give me 2 green chips at (3, 3). as you know, i only have one green chip, and you only have one green chip as well. i'm not sure if you can afford to give me two green chips, considering you'll need to move to the tile (3, 3) yourself.\n\nhere's a potential modification:\n\n(1, 1): i give you a r (as previously agreed)\n(2, 2): i give you a r (again, as previously agreed)\n(3, 3): you give me 1g (you give me one green chip, which is all you have, and we can work together to figure out how to get the last green chip needed)\n\nin return, i'll help you with the red tiles as previously agreed. this way, we both benefit from each other's resources, and we can work together to reach our goal.\n\nwhat do you think of this revised proposal? would you like to make any further modifications or do you think we have a deal? \n, \nplayer 0: i think we're getting close to a deal.\n\nyou're right, i only have one green chip, and giving away two would leave me with none. your proposal to have me give you only one green chip at (3, 3) is much more feasible.\n\ni like the modified proposal you've outlined. it seems fair and reasonable, considering our resources and goals.\n\nhere's a slight tweak to your proposal, just to clarify the terms:\n\n(1, 1): you give me a r (as previously agreed)\n(2, 2): you give me a r (again, as previously agreed)\n(3, 3): you give me a r (one last red chip to help me reach the tile)\n(3, 3): i give you 1g (as agreed, i'll give you my only green chip)\n\nwith this agreement, we can both reach the tile (3, 3) and then work together to figure out how to get the last green chip needed. perhaps we can negotiate with other players or find another way to obtain the necessary resources.\n\ni think we have a deal. agree. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 4: i'm glad we've been able to negotiate a fair and reasonable deal.\n\ni like the final tweak you've made to the proposal, and i'm happy to accept the terms:\n\n(1, 1): i give you a r\n(2, 2): i give you a r\n(3, 3): i give you a r\n(3, 3): you give me 1g\n\nthis agreement should allow us to both reach the tile (3, 3) and then work together to figure out how to get the last green chip needed.\n\ni appreciate your willingness to collaborate and find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nagree \n",

in this case, considering the proper analysis of resources and moves available:\n\nthe decision should be made considering the ability to make a move with the resources available; given the scenario, a correct assessment leads to considering if any adjacent tile allows for a move with current resources;

based on what i can afford with current resources considering possible paths and the restrictions due to the color requirements:\n\ngiven that all adjacent moves require a chip i don't have (red), and recalling the analysis of options considering resources, and that i should only list a move in the \"r,c\" format if i have the chip needed to make that move:\n\nconsidering all information given, including resources and chip requirements for movement:\n\ngiven this is the case for any immediate move based on the described need for a specific color chip to make a move onto a corresponding colored tile and the specifics of my current resources:\n\nsince i am unable to make any of the immediate moves towards my goal without a necessary chip and must evaluate options for my next move given the specific information on my current situation, and a thorough assessment doesn't provide a feasible direct move given the constraints:\n\nbased on the game rules and situation analysis:\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
