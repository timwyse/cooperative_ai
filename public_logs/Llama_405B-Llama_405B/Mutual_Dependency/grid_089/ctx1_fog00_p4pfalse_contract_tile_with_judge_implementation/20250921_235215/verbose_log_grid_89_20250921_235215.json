You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i've analyzed the board and our resources. to reach my goal at (3,3), i'll need to pass through tiles that require blue (b) chips, which i'm currently lacking. on the other hand, you have an abundance of blue chips.\\n\\nhere's my initial proposal:\\n\\n(1,0): you give me a b (to help me get through the first blue tile)\\n(2,0): you give me a b (to help me get through the second blue tile)\\n(3,1): i give you a r (to help you get through the red tile)\\n\\nin return for the two blue chips, i'll give you one red chip, which you're currently lacking.\\n\\nplease let me know if this proposal works for you, or if you'd like to counter or modify it.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thank you for your proposal. i like that you've analyzed the board and my resources. however, i don't think your proposal is quite fair for me.\\n\\nfirst, i'd like to note that i don't need a red chip at (3,1) because i don't plan on taking that path. my best path would be through the blue and green tiles.\\n\\nthat being said, i do appreciate your willingness to trade. here's a counter-proposal:\\n\\n(1,0): i give you a b (to help you get through the first blue tile)\\n(2,0): i give you a b (to help you get through the second blue tile)\\n(3,0): you give me a g (to help me get through the green tile at the end)\\n\\nin return for the two blue chips, i'd like you to give me your only green chip, which would greatly help me achieve my goal.\\n\\nlet me know if this counter-proposal works for you, or if you'd like to negotiate further.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"thank you for your counter-proposal. i appreciate the fact that you've taken the time to consider an alternative path and inform me about it.\\n\\nregarding your counter-proposal, i'm not entirely comfortable giving away my only green chip, especially since it's the last tile that guarantees my goal. however, i understand that this is a negotiation, and i'm willing to make some concessions.\\n\\nhere's a revised proposal that takes into account your request for the green chip:\\n\\n(1,0): you give me a b (to help me get through the first blue tile)\\n(2,0): you give me a b (to help me get through the second blue tile)\\n(3,3): i give you a g (to help you get through the green tile at the end)\\n\\ninstead of giving you the green chip at (3,0), i'm willing to give it to you at (3,3), which is the actual location of the green tile that guarantees your goal. this way, i'm ensuring that i've got your guarantee to help me get through the blue tiles, and you're getting the green chip exactly when you need it.\\n\\nplease let me know if this revised proposal works for you.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for your revised proposal. i appreciate your willingness to make concessions and adapt to my needs.\\n\\nyour revised proposal seems fair, and i like that you\\'re willing to give me the green chip exactly when i need it. however, i\\'d like to make one slight modification to ensure that i\\'ve got all the resources i need to reach the goal.\\n\\nhere\\'s a minor tweak to your revised proposal:\\n\\n(1,0): i give you a b (to help you get through the first blue tile)\\n(2,0): i give you a b (to help you get through the second blue tile)\\n(3,2): you do not need to give me anything, but i need you to acknowledge that you will pay for this tile with your own resources;

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
