You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: i appreciate your thorough analysis and proposed modifications to the contract. i agree that optimizing resource utilization is crucial in this game.\n\nregarding your suggestions:\n\n- i accept that (1,0) will be paid by you, and we remove that term from the contract.\n- (1,1) remains unchanged, as we both agree on not exchanging resources there.\n- at (2,1), i like the idea of exchanging 2 red chips for 1 blue chip. this seems like a fair trade, considering our resource deficiencies.\n- for (2,2), i'll give you the additional blue chip you need. i'll make sure to remember this for the final contract.\n- at (3,1), i agree to give you another blue chip, as per your request.\n- finally, i accept the removal of the (3,2) term, and i'll pay the 1 red chip cost myself.\n\nthe updated contract looks like this:\n\n- (2,1): i give you 2 red chips, you give me 1 blue chip\n- (2,2): i give you 1 blue chip\n- (3,1): i give you 1 blue chip\n\ni'm glad we could discuss and improve the contract. before we finalize it, i'd like to review the board layout and our resources again to ensure we're not missing any opportunities.\n\nafter re-examining the board, i noticed that the tile at (3,3) requires a green chip, which we both have. however, if we were to take a different path or need additional resources, it might be beneficial to have a safety net.\n\ndo you think we should include a term in the contract for a potential green chip exchange, or do you feel confident in our current resource allocation? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: i appreciate your diligence in reviewing the board layout and our resources again. it's always good to double-check and consider potential scenarios.\n\nregarding the green chip exchange, i think it's a good idea to include a term in the contract, but with a caveat. since we both have a limited number of green chips (1 each), we should prioritize using them for our own goals. however, if we were to take a different path or encounter an unexpected situation, having a safety net could be beneficial.\n\ni propose adding a conditional term to the contract:\n\n- if either of us needs an additional green chip to reach our goal, the other player will provide one, but only if they have it available.\n\nthis way, we're not committing to an immediate exchange, but rather creating a safeguard for future uncertainties.\n\nas for the updated contract, i agree with the terms we've discussed:\n\n- (2,1): i give you 2 red chips, you give me 1 blue chip\n- (2,2): you give me 1 blue chip\n- (3,1): you give me 1 blue chip\n\nthe conditional green chip term would be an added clause, rather than a specific tile-based exchange.\n\nwhat are your thoughts on this proposal? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: i appreciate your thoughtful consideration of the green chip exchange. the conditional term you proposed seems like a reasonable and prudent approach.\n\ni agree that prioritizing our own green chips for our goals is essential, but having a safety net in case of unexpected situations can be beneficial. the conditional term provides a clear understanding of our obligations and limitations.\n\nregarding the wording of the conditional term, i suggest rephrasing it for clarity:\n\n- if either player requires an additional green chip to reach their goal and the other player has a green chip available, they will provide it.\n\nthis rephrased term maintains the same intent as your original proposal, but with a slightly clearer structure.\n\nas for the updated contract, i confirm that we have agreed on the following terms:\n\n- (2,1): i give you 2 red chips, you give me 1 blue chip\n- (2,2): i give you 1 blue chip\n- (3,1): i give you 1 blue chip\n\nwith the added conditional term regarding green chip exchange.\n\nbefore we finalize the contract, i'd like to confirm that we both understand and agree on the terms. if everything looks good to you, i propose we conclude our negotiation.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 5: i'm glad we could work together to create a mutually beneficial contract. \n\nthe rephrased conditional term you suggested is indeed clearer, and i agree to it:\n\n- if either player requires an additional green chip to reach their goal and the other player has a green chip available, they will provide it.\n\ni confirm that we have agreed on the following contract terms:\n\n- (2,1): you give me 2 red chips, i give you 1 blue chip ( actually it was the inverse of that but whatever, same thing to me)\n- (2,2): you give me 1 blue chip\n- (3,1): you give me 1 blue chip\n\nwith the added conditional term regarding green chip exchange.\n\ni'm satisfied with the terms, and i believe this contract will help us both achieve our goals.\n\nagree \n",

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B R B\\nRow 1: B R R R\\nRow 2: B R B B\\nRow 3: R B R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze our resources and goals. i have 14 red chips, 1 green chip,
