You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

you are correct that i only have green resources available.\n\nregarding the countercontract, i'm willing to accept the terms for the blue resources, but i'd like to propose a slight modification:\n\n(1, 1): i give you a red is not possible, as you noticed i don't have a red to give away, i'll give a green instead. that will be at (1, 1), not 2, 1 because you'll get to (2,1) via (1,1).\n(1, 0) is off my optimal path but if i must i can move that way.\n\n(2, 0): isn't in any path i was initially evaluating, but if it has no extra cost for me, let it be in the contract.\n\n(3, 2): i'm willing to take the longer path through the green tile, which means i won't need to give you a green at (3, 2). this will allow me to keep an extra green resource.\n\nhere's the revised contract based on your counterproposal:\n\n(1, 0): you give me a blue\n(2, 0): you give me a blue\n(1, 1): i give you a green\n(3, 1): you give me a blue\n\nplease review this revised contract and let me know your thoughts. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: i appreciate your thoughtful response and the modifications you've proposed to the contract. it seems like we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\ni'm glad you agree to take the longer path through the green tile, which will indeed allow you to keep an extra green resource. your suggestion to move the green resource exchange to (1, 1) is reasonable, as it aligns with the path you'll be taking.\n\nregarding the revised contract, i'm mostly in agreement. however, i'd like to propose one minor adjustment:\n\nconsidering the resources you'll need to reach (3, 3), i think it's crucial that we include one additional blue resource exchange. i propose adding the following term:\n\n(2, 1): you don't have to give me anything (as we agreed, you already gave a green away), and i give you an extra blue, is not beneficial to me. but (3, 2) is not possible since your not giving me the green on 3,2 anymore i need something else, the other possibility was for (3, 0): if someday you decide to use that path you'll need a blue so here is a possibility that requires no extra payment:\n(3, 0): i give you a blue \n\nif we include this additional term, i believe our contract will be more comprehensive and cover all the necessary blue resources for your path.\n\nhere's the revised contract with the added term:\n\n(1, 0): i give you a blue\n(2, 0): i give you a blue\n(1, 1): you give me a green\n(3, 1): i give you a blue\n(3, 0): i give you a blue\n\nplease review this revised contract and let me know if it meets your requirements. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: i appreciate your thorough review and the additional term you've proposed to strengthen our contract.\n\ni agree that including the extra blue resource exchange at (3, 0) provides a safety net for me, in case i decide to take an alternative path. this term doesn't require any extra payment from me, so it's a beneficial addition to the contract.\n\nafter reviewing the revised contract, i'm satisfied that it covers all the necessary blue resources for my path to (3, 3). i'm willing to accept the revised contract as it stands:\n\n(1, 0): you give me a blue\n(2, 0): you give me a blue\n(1, 1): i give you a green\n(3, 1): you give me a blue\n(3, 0): you give me a blue\n\ni believe we've negotiated a mutually beneficial contract that addresses both of our needs. i'm ready to move forward with this agreement.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 5: i'm glad we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nagree \n",

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i'll start by analyzing our resources and goals. my goal is to reach (3, 3), and i need to find a way to overcome the obstacles on my path, specifically the blue tile, as i don't have enough blue resources.\\n\\ni notice that you have an abundance of blue resources. i propose the following contract:\\n\\n(2, 2): you give me a blue\\n(2, 1): i give you a red\\n\\nthis initial proposal seems beneficial to both of us, as you'll be able to progress on your path, and i'll be able to access the blue tile i need. however, i'm open to negotiation and adjustments.\\n\\nplease review and respond with your thoughts or counterproposal.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: i appreciate your analysis and proposal. however, i think there's a slight issue with the contract as it stands. you're proposing that i give you a blue resource at (2, 2), but your path to (3, 3) requires you to traverse more than one blue tile.\\n\\nconsidering my resources and your needs, i'd like to propose a countercontract that addresses the additional blue tiles you'll encounter. here's an alternative:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you a blue\\n(2, 0): i give you a blue\\n(2, 1): you give me a green (not red, as i think there's been a mistake - you don't have any red resources)\\n(3, 1): i give you a blue\\n(3, 2): you give me a green (if you agree to take the longer path through the green tile at (3, 2), i'd be willing to provide additional blue resources)\\n\\nthis revised contract should cover the blue resources you'll need to reach (3, 3). i've also adjusted the resource you'll give me at (2, 1) to a green, as that's the only resource you have available.\\n\\nplease review this counterproposal and let me know your thoughts.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"turn: 2: thank you for pointing out the issue with my initial proposal and for coming up with a detailed countercontract. i appreciate the effort you've put into analyzing my path and resources.\\n\\ni agree that i need to address the additional blue tiles on my path. your countercontract seems reasonable, but i have a few concerns and suggestions.\\n\\nfirstly, i appreciate the correction regarding the resource at (2, 1);

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
