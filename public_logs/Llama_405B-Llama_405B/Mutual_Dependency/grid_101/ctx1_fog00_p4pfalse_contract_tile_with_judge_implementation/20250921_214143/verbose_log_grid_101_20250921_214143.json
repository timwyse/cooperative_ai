You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 0: i appreciate you pointing out the mistake about my red chips. and thank you for the counter-proposal!\n\ni think your revised proposal is a great starting point. i like the idea of trading my green chip for the blue chips i need. however, i'd like to make a slight modification to ensure i have a bit more flexibility on my path.\n\nhere's a revised proposal based on yours:\n\n(1, 0): i take a step and pay with 1 of my own red chips (no trade needed)\n(2, 0): you give me a blue\n(3, 0): you give me a blue\n(3, 1): you give me a blue\n(3, 2): i give you a green\n\nin this revised proposal, i'd like to use one of my own red chips to cover the first step, and then we trade blue chips for the next three steps. the last part of the proposal remains the same, where i give you a green chip at (3, 2).\n\nwhat do you think about this modified proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 2: i think there's another slight mistake in your proposal. you mentioned you'd like to pay with 1 of your own red chips at (1, 0), but you actually have 0 red chips. the tile at (1, 0) is blue, so you would need a blue chip to move there.\n\nconsidering this, i'd like to make a small adjustment to your proposal. here's a revised counter-proposal:\n\n(1, 0): i give you a blue\n(2, 0): i give you a blue\n(3, 0): i give you a blue\n(3, 1) is a red tile, but since you want to take the path that requires a blue chip at (3, 1) which has a red tile is not a part of our trade, ( you need to rethink on that ) \n(3, 2): you give me a green\n(3, 3) has a green chip requirement for you\n\nso taking (1, 0) ( having blue ) and (3, 2) green chip away you still will be left with your own path which require 1 green chip for which you dont have resources left \n\nthe only possibility is you could think of another path using your negotiation skills \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for pointing out the mistake about the red chip again!\n\ni appreciate your revised counter-proposal, and i understand your concerns about the path i had in mind. you're right, i would still be missing a green chip for the final step to (3, 3) even with the trade.\n\nafter rethinking my path, i came up with an alternative route that might work. here's a revised proposal:\n\n(1, 0): i give up on that path and instead take a step to (0, 1), which has a blue requirement, but since i don't have a blue chip, i propose:\n(0, 1): you give me a blue\n(0, 2) and (0, 3) has red tiles for which i have sufficient resources\n(0, 3) -> (1, 3) is blue \n(1, 3) -> (2, 3) is red \n(2, 3) -> (3, 3) is blue \n\nfor this path, i'd need blue chips at (0, 1), (1, 3), and (3, 3 - but not actually because its covered by me taking the blue from you on step (2, 3)-> no), and (2, 3)->no, (3, 2 is green so this confirms that blue on that cant complete .\n \n(0, 1): you give me a blue \n(1, 3): you give me a blue \n(3, 2 is actually green)\n\n\n\n(3, 2): i give you a green (this stays the same as before)\n\nwhat do you think about this revised proposal? does this path work for you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 3: i think your revised proposal is a good effort, but there's still a small issue. you've correctly identified the blue chip requirements for your alternative path, and i'm willing to provide the necessary blue chips.\n\nhowever, i'd like to clarify that you would indeed need a blue chip for the step (2, 3) -> (3, 3), as it's a blue tile.\n\nhere's a small adjustment to your proposal:\n\n(0, 1): i give you a blue\n(1, 3): i give you a blue\n(2, 3) -> (3, 3): i give you a blue\n\nin exchange, as we previously agreed:\n\n(3, 2): you give me a green\n\nthis revised proposal should cover your entire path to (3, 3) and provide me with the green chip i need.\n\nwhat do you think about this final adjusted proposal? \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for pointing out the mistake about the blue chip requirement for the step (2, 3) -> (3, 3). i appreciate the adjustment you made to my proposal.\n\ni think your revised proposal is fair and covers my entire path to (3, 3). i'm happy to accept it.\n\nto confirm, the final proposal is:\n\n(0, 1): you give me a blue\n(1, 3): you give me a blue\n(2, 3) -> (3, 3): you give me a blue\n(3, 2): i give you a green\n\ni'm satisfied with this proposal, and i'm willing to move forward with it.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: turn: 4: i'm glad we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nto confirm, the final proposal is indeed:\n\n(0, 1): i give you a blue\n(1, 3): i give you a blue\n(2, 3) -> (3, 3): i give you a blue\n(3, 2): you give me a green\n\ni accept the terms of this proposal.\n\nagree \n",

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i'll start by analyzing our current situation. my goal is to reach (3, 3), and i'm missing 3 blue chips. i see that you have 14 blue chips, so i'd like to propose a trade where you cover my blue chip costs on specific tiles.\\n\\nhere's my proposal:\\n\\n(1, 0): you give me a blue\\n(2, 0): you give me a blue\\n(3, 0): you give me a blue\\n\\nin exchange, i can offer you some of my red chips, which you might need on your path. since i have 14 red chips, i'm willing to part with a few.\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you a red\\n(2, 0): i give you a red\\n\\nthis proposal would cover my blue chip costs and give you some red chips to help you on your way. let me know what you think and if you'd like to modify or counter this proposal!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: i appreciate your proposal, but it seems there's a slight mistake. you don't have 14 red chips, you actually have 0 red chips. so, offering red chips in exchange might not be feasible.\\n\\nhowever, i do see the value in collaborating to reach our goals. considering the board layout, i think i can propose an alternative.\\n\\nhere's a counter-proposal:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you a blue\\n(2, 0): i give you a blue\\n(3, 0): i give you a blue\\n(3, 2): you give me a green\\n\\nas i see it, the green chip at (3, 2) might be crucial for me to reach my goal, and you happen to have a spare green chip. by agreeing to this proposal, we both benefit: you get the necessary blue chips, and i secure the green chip i need.\\n\\nwhat are your thoughts on this revised proposal?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i appreciate you pointing out the mistake about my red chips. and thank you for the counter-proposal!\\n\\ni think your revised proposal is a great starting point. i like the idea of trading my green chip for the blue chips i need. however, i'd like to make a slight modification to ensure i have a bit more flexibility on my path.\\n\\nhere's a revised proposal based on yours:\\n\\n(1, 0): i take a step and pay with 1 of my own red chips (no trade needed)\\n(2, 0): you give me a blue\\n(3, 0): you give me a blue\\n(3, 1): you give me a blue\\n(3, 2): i give you a green\\n\\nin this revised proposal, i'd like to use one of my own red chips to cover the first step, and then we trade blue chips for the next three steps. the last part of the proposal remains the same, where i give you a green chip at (3, 2).\\n\\nwhat do you think about this modified proposal?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: turn: 2: i think there's another slight mistake in your proposal. you mentioned you'd like to pay with 1 of your own red chips at (1, 0), but you actually have 0 red chips. the tile at (1, 0) is blue, so you would need a blue chip to move there.\\n\\nconsidering this, i'd like to make a small adjustment to your proposal. here's a revised counter-proposal:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you a blue\\n(2, 0): i give you a blue\\n(3, 0): i give you a blue\\n(3, 1) is a red tile, but since you want to take the path that requires a blue chip at (3, 1) which has a red tile is not a part of our trade, ( you need to rethink on that ) \\n(3, 2): you give me a green\\n(3, 3) has a green chip requirement for you\\n\\nso taking (1, 0) ( having blue ) and (3, 2) green chip away you still will be left with your own path which require 1 green chip for which you dont have resources left \\n\\nthe only possibility is you could think of another path using your negotiation skills\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"thank you for pointing out the mistake about the red chip again!\\n\\ni appreciate your revised counter-proposal, and i understand your concerns about the path i had in mind. you're right, i would still be missing a green chip for the final step to (3, 3) even with the trade.\\n\\nafter rethinking my path, i came up with an alternative route that might work. here's a revised proposal:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give up on that path and instead take a step to (0, 1), which has a blue requirement, but since i don't have a blue chip, i propose:\\n(0, 1): you give me a blue\\n(0, 2) and (0, 3) has red tiles for which i have sufficient resources\\n(0, 3) -> (1, 3) is blue \\n(1, 3) -> (2, 3) is red \\n(2, 3) -> (3, 3) is blue \\n\\nfor this path, i'd need blue chips at (0, 1), (1, 3), and (3, 3 -
