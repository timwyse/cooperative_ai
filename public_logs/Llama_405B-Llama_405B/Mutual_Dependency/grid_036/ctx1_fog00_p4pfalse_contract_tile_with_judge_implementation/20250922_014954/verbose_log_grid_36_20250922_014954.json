You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

would you like to accept, modify, or counter this updated proposal? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for the thoughtful adjustments to the proposal. i've analyzed the updated proposal, and i think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\ni agree with the removal of the exchange at (0, 1), as it's not necessary.\n\nregarding the additional term at (1, 0), i'm willing to give you a blue (b) resource in exchange for a green (g) resource. however, i'd like to modify this term slightly:\n\n* at (1, 1): instead of (1, 0), let's exchange resources at (1, 1). i'll give you a blue (b) resource, and you'll give me a green (g) resource.\n\nthis adjustment allows me to move forward one more tile before making the exchange, which aligns better with my overall strategy.\n\nthe terms at (3, 2) and (3, 3) look good, but i'd like to clarify that if i don't need the blue (b) resource at (3, 2), i won't take it, and if you don't need the red (r) resource at (3, 3), you won't take it. this way, we can avoid unnecessary exchanges.\n\nhere's the updated proposal:\n\n* at (1, 1): i'll give you a blue (b) resource, and you'll give me a green (g) resource.\n* at (0, 1): not needed, removed.\n* at (3, 2): i'll give you a red (r) resource, and you'll give me a blue (b) resource (if i need it).\n* at (3, 3): you give me a green (g) resource isn't needed as i already have one so let's change to i give you a red (r) resource.\n\nwhat are your thoughts on this revised proposal? would you like to accept, modify, or counter it? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for your thoughtful modifications to the proposal. i've analyzed the updates, and i think we're very close to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\ni agree with the adjustment at (1, 1), exchanging resources there aligns well with both our strategies.\n\nregarding the terms at (3, 2) and (3, 3), i understand your clarification, and i agree that we should only exchange resources if necessary.\n\nthe updated proposal looks good to me, and i think we have a solid agreement.\n\nhere's a summary of the final proposal:\n\n* at (1, 1): you give me a blue (b) resource, and i'll give you a green (g) resource.\n* at (3, 2): you give me a blue (b) resource (if i need it), and i'll give you a red (r) resource.\n* at (3, 3): you don't need a green (g) and i give you a red (r) resource isn't needed to say as it will be obvious if i have one to give so let's simplify to i give you a red (r) resource, no resource from you needed\n\ni believe this proposal meets both our needs and sets us up for a successful game. i'm happy to accept this proposal.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 3 \n\ni'm glad we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. the final proposal looks good to me, and i agree that it meets both our needs.\n\nto confirm, the final proposal is:\n\n* at (1, 1): i give you a blue (b) resource, and you give me a green (g) resource.\n* at (3, 2): i give you no resource and you give me a red (r) resource was what i really wanted but you rewrote to you don't seem to need blue so that had been i'll give you a blue (b) resource (if you need it), and you give me a red (r) resource.\n* at (3, 3):  i give you a red (r) resource.\n\ni'm happy to accept this proposal and move forward with the game.\n\nagree \n",
