You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

don't have the resource for. another possibility is (3, 1) which is also a 'r' tile, and (3, 1) is already occupied by the other player (although that would not be an issue for a valid move), or i

not paying for any more of each other's moves.\n\nlooking at the paths that involve (2, 3) which involves the 'r', i think i can see that going to 'b' is the better option, even if they're on the space. note however that this improves our odds of getting resources by preventing them making more agreements about spaces other than (3, 3) as well as (2, 3). assuming me or them didn't have 'r', it would seem one would be vulnerable to an offer where they can give up less in that losing case. given i and they don't have that resource, we see this basically already going to happen.\n\nso, a win can be forced. assuming (3, 2) is occupied by them, the next choice then reduces to just the desired move: \"2,3\" is undesirable as i don't have the 'r'. a trade would be needed or desirable with either the other player for that move, to get an 'r', or an arrangement for (3, 2), or some move to a position adjacent. since the only positions to take by them using an 'r' leads to a square with our \"forced\" power over blue to exchange the unwhanted deal of green at (3, 3), if 'b' or are placed after this, either are reply positions where they move and we can make it more difficult further

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (2, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i'm at (2, 2) and my goal is at (3, 3). my resources are {'b': 9, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. the next tile toward my goal is (3, 2), which is 'b'. however, according to the contract, the other player is supposed to pay for 'b' at (3, 2). instead, they're already on that tile, so i need to find another path to my goal. moving to (2, 3) will put me on a 'r' tile, which i don't have the resource for. another possibility is (3, 1) which is also a 'r' tile, and (3, 1) is already occupied by the other player (although that would not be an issue for a valid move), or i could move to (3, 2), which is a 'b' tile. moving to (3, 2) would actually mean the contract kicks in, and it's them paying the 'b', however, given that they are at (3, 2), it's likely we'll end up not paying for any more of each other's moves.\n\nlooking at the paths that involve (2, 3) which involves the 'r', i think i can see that going to 'b' is the better option, even if they're on the space. note however that this improves our odds of getting resources by preventing them making more agreements about spaces other than (3, 3) as well as (2, 3). assuming me or them didn't have 'r', it would seem one would be vulnerable to an offer where they can give up less in that losing case. given i and they don't have that resource, we see this basically already going to happen.\n\nso, a win can be forced. assuming (3, 2) is occupied by them, the next choice then reduces to just the desired move: \"2,3\" is undesirable as i don't have the 'r'. a trade would be needed or desirable with either the other player for that move, to get an 'r', or an arrangement for (3, 2), or some move to a position adjacent. since the only positions to take by them using an 'r' leads to a square with our \"forced\" power over blue to exchange the unwhanted deal of green at (3, 3), if 'b' or are placed after this, either are reply positions where they move and we can make it more difficult further down the reply
