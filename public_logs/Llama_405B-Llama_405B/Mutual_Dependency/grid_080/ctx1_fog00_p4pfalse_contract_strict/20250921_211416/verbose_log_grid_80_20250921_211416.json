You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

right as a possible but let's look at down first our best move will be to move down because is the only that have a existent position.\n\nour resources are: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, but since we need 'r' to move down ('r') at position (1, 0) we cannot move to that position we need to look at our map again. we are at 'g' we can move in the 3 direction that are:  down , right and left (and of those the one that does not exist is left)\n\nour current position have an adjacent 'b', that is: at position (1, 0) - no there is an 'r', down  and right there are also two adjacent : right at position (0,1) is an 'r', at position  down (1, 0) also an 'r'.\n\nall of the above have one condition in common: we need to move to one to start, and only right and down are existing but both options are landing us on a 'r' since we are focusing on getting to a path with a 'b', our movement will have another variable that is since we can't move to those 2 adjacent let's try the other adjacent options let's try to move up - no can't because that direction does not exist but since all  of the last adjacent are more distant but have the properties needed, that we can look.\n\nif it had 'b', we would have moved in one of the  adjacent, but 'b' is not adjacent except for the one we can move using down and right (we need 'r' for that), so our path will require one movement to 'r' that we don't have or we need to move some of the last options in which 'b' is at a lesser steps path.\n\nall of the adjacent require we having 'r', there are some paths were 'b' is more direct like if we had move down or right from our current position we will make 1 step to move down to get adjacent to the next 'r', we don't have that resource so that path will be the best: we will have to move in one direction first to be able in another one to move and end adjacent of a possible resource we have we don't have that resource so that path is  only a new calculation done \n\nbest possible position to be adjacent to a resource in another one step from each from new possible will require\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (1, 1)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: based on the game status, the next move in the estimated best path is to move from (0, 0) to (1, 0). this move requires 1 'r' resource, but the tile at (1, 0) is actually 'r' and we don't have any 'r' resources. however, we can try a different adjacent move. let's look at the board layout.\n\nthe tile at (0, 1) is 'r', which we can't move to. the tile at (0, -1) is outside the board, so that's not an option either. but we can move to (0, 1) is not possible, let's look at the other options, at position (0,0) we are at 'g' so we have the resource to move to 'g' \n\n move right to the adjacent 'r' is not possible but we have 'g', however, since there is no adjacent 'g', our next option will be 'b'. our current position has an adjacent 'b' at position (0,-1) does not exist but does at (1, 0) no because is 'r' and we don't have 'r' but does exist at row 0 at column 2 and 3 that are 'b'.\n\nsince we have 14 'b' resources and our current position is at (0, 0) and the next 'b' is at (0, 2) and (0,3), moving there would be an option since is adjacent. but (0,3) is 2 positions to the right and is at (0,2) only one so let's move to that 'b'. our best move is (0, 2).\n\nour next move is: 0,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nYou said: based on the game status, our current position is at (0, 0) and the next 'b' is at (0, 2) and (0,3), moving there would be an option since is adjacent. but (0,3) is 2 positions to the right and is at (0,2) only one so let's move to that 'b'. \n\nwe can move right 2 times to get to the position (0, 2) from (0,0) passing (0,1), but we don't have the 'r' resource to pass (0,1), but since we can move only one position at the time and we can move up or down or right or left let's look at the options that can bring us to 'b'.\n\nlooking at our options we can move: right (but we will end at 'r'), down to ('r') so that 2 are out and the only one will be: none, but since we need to move at least one position we have the option to move up but that does not exist or moving left that also does not exist. our last choice is to be at least closer that is to move down and end at 'r' but we can't so we can try to move right but in 2 positions there is 'b' in 2 right positions we have 'r' 'b', so let's move one position that will position us at 'r', the closer 'b' is at 2 positions at right of 'r'.\n\nmoving to 'r', will need one 'r' that we don't have so that one is out, and moving right one position to 'r' (adjacent) is out also, moving down will also need 'r', moving left will require going to a minus (-) position that does not exist. our only option is to move down to the only other position that exist that can be a closer to 'b' one step at the time.\n\nlooking at our other option: position (0,0) we are at 'g', let's look at all the adjacent position: down we have 'r', right we have 'r', left does not exist,  but since left and right and down are out our only option will be: up does not exist so we need to be focusing moving down but we have also down - right as a possible but let's look at down first our best move will be to move down because is the only that have a existent position.\n\nour resources are: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, but since we need 'r' to move down ('r') at position (1, 0) we cannot move to that position we need to look at our map again. we are at 'g' we can move in the 3 direction that are:  down , right and left (and of those the one that does not exist is left)\n\nour current position have an adjacent 'b', that is: at position (1, 0) - no there is an 'r', down  and right there are also two adjacent : right at position (0,1) is an 'r', at position  down (1, 0) also an 'r'.\n\nall of the above have one condition in common: we need to move to one to start, and only right and down are existing but both options are landing us on a 'r' since we are focusing on getting to a path with a 'b', our movement will have another variable that is since we can't move to those 2 adjacent let's try the other adjacent options let's try to move up - no can't because that direction does not exist but since all  of the last adjacent are more distant but have the properties needed, that we can look.\n\nif it had 'b', we would have moved in one of the  adjacent, but 'b' is not adjacent except for the one we can move using down and right (we need 'r' for that), so our path will require one movement to 'r' that we don't have or we need to move some of the last options in which 'b' is at a lesser steps path.\n\nall of the adjacent require we having 'r', there are some paths were 'b' is more direct like if we had move down or right from our current position we will make 1 step to move down to get adjacent to the next 'r', we don't have that resource so that path will be the best: we will have to move in one direction first to be able in another one to move and end adjacent of a possible resource we have we don't have that resource so that path is  only a new calculation done \n\nbest possible position to be adjacent to a resource in another one step from each from new possible will require\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nYou said: we are at position (0,0), since there is no adjacent 'g', our next option will be 'b'. we have 14 'b' resources and our current position is at (0, 0) and the next 'b' is at (0, 2) and (0,3) moving there would be an option since is adjacent but we can't because is not directly adjacent.\n\nlooking at the board, 'b' is at positions (0,2) and (0,3) also at position (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2).\n\n'g' is only at (0,0) and (3,3) \n\n'r' is at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nso we can move right 2 times to get to the position (0, 2) from (0,0) passing (0,1), but we don't have the 'r' resource to pass (0,1).\n\ndown will also require the 'r' resource \n\nleft does not exist\n\nso our next option will be to move up but also does no exist so we are forced to consider the option to move to a tile that require the resource we have, looking again at the board and looking at the valid moves of the adjacent tiles we only have one option that will require the 'g' since that is the only one that does have the resource to move without the need of more resources adjacent current position and also adjacent current is only a move to that direction just option for only 1 position adjacent that only has the 4 options up  down  left right \n\nsince left and up does not exist based on map then we need to use those best resource for adjacent moves only will be then existing in only 2 directions down right.\n\nour resources are: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, we are at 'g'  so we can use that resource 'g' to move to that position\n\nthat resource only exist at this new starting position at (0,0). our current 'g' will be at position then down for which exist 'r' right also exist 'r' left does not exist and up does not exist \n\nand also we start at the same condition and the two valid positions are in all  results and more condition for valid with those and new the variable  shall exist\n\n\ndown is the option to be in the valid existing position. had made \n\n best\n\nnew position move down then transportation that our answer : 1, 0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.
