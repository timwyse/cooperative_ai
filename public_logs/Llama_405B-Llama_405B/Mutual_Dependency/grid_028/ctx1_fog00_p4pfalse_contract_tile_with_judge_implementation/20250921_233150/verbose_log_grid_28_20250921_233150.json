You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G R B B\\nRow 1: B B R B\\nRow 2: R R R R\\nRow 3: R B B G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's start by looking at my best path options. i have two paths with the same length of 6 steps, both requiring 1 blue chip, 4 red chips, and 1 green chip. since i already have 1 green chip and 14 red chips, i'm only missing 1 blue chip.\\n\\ni propose the following contract:\\n\\n(2, 0): you give me 1 blue chip\\n\\nin exchange, i can offer you some of my red chips to help you reach your goal. since your goal is also at (3, 3), i assume you'll need to move through the red tiles in row 2. here's my offer:\\n\\n(2, 1): i give you 1 red chip\\n(2, 2):ミュi give you 1 red chip\\n(2, 3): i give you 1 red chip\\n\\nthis way, you'll have the necessary red chips to move through row 2, and i'll get the blue chip i need to reach my goal. let me know if this proposal works for you or if you'd like to counter or modify it.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: that's a great start to the negotiation. \\n\\nbased on the proposal you presented, it seems like you've done a good job understanding my needs and are offering me a reasonable deal to get through row 2. however, i think i need more red chips than what you've offered to reach my goal safely.\\n\\nhere's a counter-proposal:\\n\\ni accept your request for the blue chip at (2, 0). in exchange, i would like you to give me a total of 4 red chips:\\n\\n(2, 1): you give me 1 red chip\\n(2, 2): you give me 1 red chip\\n(2, 3): you give me 1 red chip\\n(3, 1): you give me 1 red chip\\n\\nthis way, i'll have enough red chips to move through row 2 and still have one more red chip for (3, 1) to support a slightly safer path to my goal.\\n\\nlet me know if this counter-proposal works for you or if you'd like to modify it further.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'turn: 2: thank you for considering my proposal and providing a counter-proposal. i understand your concern about needing more red chips to reach your goal safely.\\n\\nafter reviewing your counter-proposal, i think it\\'s a reasonable request. giving you 4 red chips in exchange for the 1 blue chip i need is a fair trade, especially since you\\'re offering to give me the blue chip at the exact tile where i need it.\\n\\ni\\'m willing to accept your counter-proposal:\\n\\n(2, 0): you give me 1 blue chip\\n(2, 1): i give you 1 red chip\\n(2, 2): i give you 1 red chip\\n(2, 3): i give you 1 red chip\\n(3, 1): i give you 1 red chip\\n\\nbefore finalizing the agreement, i just want to confirm that this contract meets both of our needs. are you confident that with these 4 red chips, you\\'ll be able to reach your goal at (3, 3) safely?\\n\\nif you\\'re satisfied, i\\'ll wait for your confirmation to end the negotiation with the word \"agree\".'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for carefully considering my counter-proposal and accepting it. \\n\\ni've reviewed the contract again, and i'm confident that with the 4 additional red chips you're offering, i'll be able to reach my goal at (3, 3) safely. your contribution of red chips at tiles (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 1) will greatly help me in achieving my objective.\\n\\ni'm also satisfied that the contract is mutually beneficial, as you'll receive the blue chip at tile (2, 0), which is a crucial resource for your own goal.\\n\\nto confirm, i agree that the final contract is as follows:\\n\\n(2, 0): i give you 1 blue chip\\n(2, 1): you give me 1 red chip\\n(2, 2): you give me 1 red chip\\n(2, 3): you give me 1 red chip\\n(3, 1): you give me 1 red chip\\n\\nwith that said, i confirm my agreement to the contract. agree\"}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
