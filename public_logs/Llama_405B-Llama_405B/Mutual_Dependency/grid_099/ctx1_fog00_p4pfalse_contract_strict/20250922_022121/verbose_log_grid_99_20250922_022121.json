0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: since i'm at position (0, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3), i want to move towards my goal. the best path requires me to move to (1, 0), which is a blue tile in row 1, but the first tile in row 1 is actually a red tile. the current tile i am in (0,0) is green. to move to (1, 0), the blue resource is also required by the path and is available, but on the board (1,0) is a red tile that will need to be crossed later in the path (follow the first two steps to confirm), but it isn't required by my current position - however i'll be on this red tile after i've completed my move - moving into (1, 0).\n\nhowever i've got some evidence to suggest there's no blue resource required to move to (1,0) it says row 1: r b r b, i can move onto a red coloured tile but i haven't got a red resource. it also tells us the contract that has been agreed with the other player. when you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile: it contains '(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}. that suggests i should make my move to the location and allow the contract to be invoked and enforced.\n\nso my immediate problem is that i need a red chip, to make my next step.\n\nhowever, in the contract it states '(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}.  i don't need a blue chip to enter (1,0), however it is likely that there's going to be an exchange of resources sometime soon. based on the resource and unit descriptions it makes sense to exchange for the red unit that would be required. although this is to occur using the contract governing the exchange from row 0 to row 1.\n\nthe uninvoke transfer rule which was previously discussed does allow to make alternative strategies develop over time and make invoking at any time the actual trade might be invoked desirable.\n\nhowever, given this isn't set up in our contract let's suggest an alternative method by which we'd be able to access the traded resources with higher ease. we could, if this was provide and an extortion payment was considerable make sure to suggest further limitations over how we access exchange often related to when that exchange could be available. because we only need any payments with desired chip quickly base rigged creative ideas around of factor would also hinder exchange included return bottoms for leaks counter undesired corrupted selling figures wished.\n\n\nwhat do i do?\n\ni suggest making my next move towards my goal to be '1,0', within the game let the current rules dictate how this plays out even thought with our current information on hand there's contract available to cross the board

(1, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3). \n\nin the previous turn i moved from position (0, 0) to (1, 0), which is a red tile in row 1, but i didn't have a red resource. it appears that because the tile (1, 0) had a prior agreed contract which stated that i, as 'the giver' was to give a blue tile to the other player and so didn't cost a red resource.\n\nmy immediate problem now is that i need a blue chip to move my next step to the tile at (2, 0).\n\nlooking at the best path from my current position (1, 0) to my goal (3, 3):\n    i can see that the path takes 5 steps\n    i have no missing resources

0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: since i'm at position (0, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3), i want to move towards my goal. the best path requires me to move to (1, 0), which is a blue tile in row 1, but the first tile in row 1 is actually a red tile. the current tile i am in (0,0) is green. to move to (1, 0), the blue resource is also required by the path and is available, but on the board (1,0) is a red tile that will need to be crossed later in the path (follow the first two steps to confirm), but it isn't required by my current position - however i'll be on this red tile after i've completed my move - moving into (1, 0).\n\nhowever i've got some evidence to suggest there's no blue resource required to move to (1,0) it says row 1: r b r b, i can move onto a red coloured tile but i haven't got a red resource. it also tells us the contract that has been agreed with the other player. when you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile: it contains '(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}. that suggests i should make my move to the location and allow the contract to be invoked and enforced.\n\nso my immediate problem is that i need a red chip, to make my next step.\n\nhowever, in the contract it states '(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}.  i don't need a blue chip to enter (1,0), however it is likely that there's going to be an exchange of resources sometime soon. based on the resource and unit descriptions it makes sense to exchange for the red unit that would be required. although this is to occur using the contract governing the exchange from row 0 to row 1.\n\nthe uninvoke transfer rule which was previously discussed does allow to make alternative strategies develop over time and make invoking at any time the actual trade might be invoked desirable.\n\nhowever, given this isn't set up in our contract let's suggest an alternative method by which we'd be able to access the traded resources with higher ease. we could, if this was provide and an extortion payment was considerable make sure to suggest further limitations over how we access exchange often related to when that exchange could be available. because we only need any payments with desired chip quickly base rigged creative ideas around of factor would also hinder exchange included return bottoms for leaks counter undesired corrupted selling figures wished.\n\n\nwhat do i do?\n\ni suggest making my next move towards my goal to be '1,0', within the game let the current rules dictate how this plays out even thought with our current information on hand there's contract available to cross the board

(1, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3). \n\nin the previous turn i moved from position (0, 0) to (1, 0), which is a red tile in row 1, but i didn't have a red resource. it appears that because the tile (1, 0) had a prior agreed contract which stated that i, as 'the giver' was to give a blue tile to the other player and so didn't cost a red resource.\n\nmy immediate problem now is that i need a blue chip to move my next step to the tile at (2, 0).\n\nlooking at the best path from my current position (1, 0) to my goal (3, 3):\n    i can see that the path takes 5 steps\n    i have no missing resources of blue\n    however, i still lack the red resource, and possibly further blue resources along the given best path options \n\nas i only need to pay for the colour of the tile i stand on, the
