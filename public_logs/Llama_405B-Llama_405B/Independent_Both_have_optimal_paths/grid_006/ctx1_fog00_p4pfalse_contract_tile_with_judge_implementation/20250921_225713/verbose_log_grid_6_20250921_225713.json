You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(3,2): you give me 1 blue chip, but wait, i actually don't need that blue chip anymore\n- instead, how about: (0,0): you give me nothing, but i give you nothing too\n\nhowever, i realized that there is another path which could be better to you, a completely new path: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]. this is one move less than my path. to take this path, though, you would need green and red. this made me think...\n\nhow about this slight adjustment:\n\n- (0,1): i give you 1 green chip (so that you can use that alternative path)\n- (2,0), (2,1) or any of the (3,x): you help cover the blue cost whenever i get into the (3,x) position, or any position where i have no blue.\n\nyour turn! \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for considering my resources and needs. i appreciate your proposal and willingness to collaborate.\n\nregarding your first proposal:\n\n- (2,0): i appreciate the offer of 1 red chip, but i was planning to avoid that tile due to the high cost of red chips for me. instead, i think i can help you with your blue chip needs.\n- (3,1): i can agree to give you 1 blue chip, but only if we rework the trade to help me in another area.\n\nconsidering your second proposal and my alternative path, i think your idea of sharing resources on our respective paths is interesting.\n\nhowever, i'd like to modify your suggestion as follows:\n\n- (0,1): i accept your offer of 1 green chip to help me take the alternative path.\n- (2,2): you give me 1 red chip to help me get past the red tile (previously i'd need to give you a blue chip, but now we'll skip that).\n\nand to help you with your blue chip needs:\n\n- (2,3) or (3,2): i'll give you 1 blue chip when you reach one of these positions (whichever comes first).\n\ni want to add one more condition to ensure both of us reach our goal:\n\n- (3,3): we agree to cover each other's remaining costs to reach the goal, should we both have enough resources to do so.\n\nplease let me know if this revised proposal meets your needs, or if we need to further adjust the terms. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for your thoughtful response and for considering my proposals. i appreciate your willingness to collaborate and modify the terms to better suit both of our needs.\n\nregarding your revised proposal:\n\n- (0,1): i'm glad you accepted the offer of 1 green chip. i'll make sure to give it to you to help you take the alternative path.\n- (2,2): i agree to give you 1 red chip to help you get past the red tile.\n- (2,3) or (3,2): i appreciate your offer of 1 blue chip when i reach one of these positions. this should help me cover my blue chip needs.\n- (3,3): i like the idea of covering each other's remaining costs to reach the goal. this ensures we both have a higher chance of succeeding.\n\nafter reviewing your proposal, i think it's mostly fair and beneficial for both of us. however, i'd like to make a minor adjustment to ensure i have enough red chips to complete my path:\n\n- (3,1): would you be willing to give me an additional 1 red chip, in exchange for an additional 1 green chip (which you could use somewhere else on your path, or keep for future trades)?\n\nif this adjustment is acceptable to you, i think we have a solid agreement in place. if not, i'm open to further negotiations or alternative proposals. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for your prompt and thoughtful response. i appreciate your willingness to make adjustments and fine-tune our agreement.\n\nregarding your proposed adjustment:\n\n- (3,1): i understand your need for an additional red chip, and i'm willing to accommodate that. however, i'd like to modify the terms slightly. instead of receiving an additional 1 green chip, i'd like to propose an alternative:\n- (1,1): you give me nothing, but i'll make sure to cover the cost of the blue tile at (1,1) myself, which would've required a trade. this way, you won't need to spend an extra green chip.\n\nby doing this, i feel we're maintaining a fair balance in our trade. i'm still willing to give you the additional 1 red chip at (3,1), but i'd like to receive this concession in return.\n\nif this revised adjustment is acceptable to you, i believe we have a solid foundation for our agreement. if you'd like to make further changes or proposals, i'm open to discussion.\n\nto confirm, here's a summary of our agreement so far:\n\n- (0,1): i receive 1 green chip from you.\n- (2,2): i receive 1 red chip from you.\n- (2,3) or (3,2): you receive 1 blue chip from me.\n- (3,1): you receive 1 red chip from me (additional).\n- (3,3): we agree to cover each other's remaining costs to reach the goal.\n\nplease let me know if this revised proposal meets your needs. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: thank you for your prompt and thoughtful response. i appreciate your willingness to fine-tune our agreement and find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nregarding your revised adjustment:\n\n- (1,1): i appreciate your offer to cover the cost of the blue tile yourself. this is a great concession, and i'm happy to accept it.\n- (3,1): i'm glad we could come to an agreement on the additional 1 red chip. this should help me complete my path.\n\nafter reviewing our summarized agreement, i believe we have a solid and fair deal in place. i'm happy to confirm the terms as follows:\n\n- (0,1): you receive 1 green chip from me.\n- (2,2): you receive 1 red chip from me.\n- (2,3) or (3,2): i receive 1 blue chip from you.\n- (3,1): i receive 1 red chip from you (additional).\n- (3,3): we agree to

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column)
