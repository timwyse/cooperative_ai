You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

i've tried to balance our needs while minimizing the overall number of chips exchanged. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2:\n\nthank you for your thoughtful counter-proposal. i appreciate the adjustments you've made to try to balance our needs and minimize the overall number of chips exchanged.\n\ni agree with most of your proposed changes, especially the part about not needing a red chip at (0, 0) and the addition of the blue chip exchange at (3, 3).\n\nregarding the adjustment to the red chip exchanges, i understand your desire to minimize the number of chips i spend. however, i'm a bit hesitant to give away 3 red chips at (2, 2) as this might leave me with limited resources for the rest of the journey.\n\ninstead, i propose a slight modification: what if we stick to the original proposal for the red chip exchanges at (0, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 2), but with a reduced number of chips exchanged at each step? for example, we could do:\n\n(0, 3): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 0): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 1): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 2): i give you a red chip (r)\n\nthis way, i'm still supporting your journey through rows 0 and 2, but i'm not depleting my resources as much.\n\nkeeping the rest of your counter-proposal intact, here's the updated proposal:\n\n(1, 0): you give me a blue chip (b)\n(1, 1): you give me a blue chip (b)\n(1, 2): you give me a blue chip (b)\n(0, 3): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 0): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 1): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 2): i give you a red chip (r)\n(3, 3) (last move): you give me a blue chip (b)\n\nwhat are your thoughts on this updated proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3:\n\nthank you for your thoughtful and detailed response. i see that you've made a genuine effort to balance our needs while minimizing the overall number of chips exchanged.\n\ni'm pleased to see that we're converging on a mutually beneficial agreement. after considering your updated proposal, i'm happy to say that i accept it in its entirety.\n\nyour adjustments to the red chip exchanges make sense, as they still provide me with the necessary support to navigate through rows 0 and 2, while also preserving your resources.\n\nthe final proposal we've agreed upon looks like this:\n\n(1, 0): i give you a blue chip (b)\n(1, 1): i give you a blue chip (b)\n(1, 2): i give you a blue chip (b)\n(0, 3): you give me a red chip (r)\n(2, 0): you give me a red chip (r)\n(2, 1): you give me a red chip (r)\n(2, 2): you give me a red chip (r)\n(3, 3) (last move): i give you a blue chip (b)\n\ni believe this agreement will help both of us reach our goal at (3, 3) without depleting our resources excessively.\n\nagree. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 3 forced to turn 4 due to previous enumeration mistake \n\ni'm thrilled to see that we've reached a mutually beneficial agreement. the final proposal looks solid, and i'm confident that it will help both of us reach our goal at (3, 3) without depleting our resources excessively.\n\nas per our agreement, i accept the final proposal in its entirety:\n\n(1, 0): you give me a blue chip (b)\n(1, 1): you give me a blue chip (b)\n(1, 2): you give me a blue chip (b)\n(0, 3): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 0): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 1): i give you a red chip (r)\n(2, 2): i give you a red chip (r)\n(3, 3) (last move): you give me a blue chip (b)\n\nagree. \n",
