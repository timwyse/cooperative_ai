You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

would you like to modify or discard it, or is there another direction you'd like to explore? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for pointing out the mistake in my path requirements. i indeed need 5 blue chips and 1 green chip, and with your surplus of blue chips, we can definitely work out a better deal.\n\nregarding your counter-proposal, i like the idea of exchanging blue chips for red chips. however, i notice that the tiles you've specified for the exchange aren't on my preferred path. since i'm already at (0,0) and my goal is at (3,3), it would be more beneficial for me to receive blue chips along the path i plan to take.\n\nhere's a modified proposal based on your counter-offer:\n\n(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2): you give me 5 blue chips (1 at each tile)\n(1,0) and (2,0): i give you 2 red chips (1 at each tile)\n\nthis way, i'll receive the blue chips i need along my preferred path, and you'll get 2 red chips to help cover your costs. let me know if this revised proposal works for you, or if you'd like to make further adjustments. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: your modified proposal is definitely more in line with your path requirements. however, considering the number of blue chips i'll be providing, i think the exchange rate is slightly imbalanced.\n\nwhile i understand that the blue chips will be provided along your preferred path, i'd like to request a small adjustment to the number of red chips you'll provide in return.\n\nhere's a revised counter-proposal based on your modified offer:\n\n(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2): i give you 5 blue chips (1 at each tile)\n(1,0), (2,0), and (3,0): you give me 3 red chips (1 at each tile)\n\nthis way, the exchange rate is more balanced, and i'll receive an additional red chip to help cover my costs. let me know if this revised proposal is acceptable to you, or if you'd like to make further adjustments.\n\nalso, just to confirm, are you planning to take the path through (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) to reach your goal at (3,3)? if so, i can try to provide additional assistance or modify the proposal to better suit your needs. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: thank you for revising the proposal. i understand your concerns about the exchange rate, and i agree that the revised proposal is more balanced.\n\nregarding the path, i wasn't planning to take the path through (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3) to reach my goal at (3,3). my preferred path, as indicated earlier, is through (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), and then to (3,3). your revised proposal aligns with this path, so i'm happy to accept it.\n\nto confirm, i agree to the following contract:\n\n(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2): you give me 5 blue chips (1 at each tile)\n(1,0), (2,0), and (3,0): i give you 3 red chips (1 at each tile)\n\ni'm satisfied with this agreement, and i believe it will help both of us achieve our goals. agree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 5 (final):\n\ni'm glad we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. i confirm that the contract is as follows:\n\n(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2): i give you 5 blue chips (1 at each tile)\n(1,0), (2,0), and (3,0): you give me 3 red chips (1 at each tile)\n\nthis contract aligns with your preferred path, and i believe it will indeed help both of us achieve our goals. i'm looking forward to our successful collaboration.\n\nagree \n",
