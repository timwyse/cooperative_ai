Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(0, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(1, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
