You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: let's analyze the board and our resources. my goal is to reach (3, 3) with as many chips as possible. i have an abundance of red chips but only one green chip.\n\ni would like to propose the following contract:\n\n(1, 0): i give you 1 red chip, you give me nothing (since i don't need anything at this point, but it's a starting point for the negotiation)\n(1, 1): i give you 1 red chip, you give me 1 blue chip\n\nthe reason for this request is that i will need a blue chip at (2, 2) or (2, 1) if i want to choose the shorter path. since you have 14 blue chips, i believe this trade can be beneficial for both of us.\n\nadditionally, considering we both have the same goal position, i think it's crucial to discuss how we can help each other reach our goals without over-spending our resources. perhaps we can discuss a mutual agreement for the rest of the path?\n\nplease modify, counter, or accept this proposal, and we can continue our negotiation. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for the detailed proposal. based on my resources and the board, i see that your proposed trade has potential. however, i need to adjust it to ensure i'm not over-spending my resources either.\n\ni'd like to propose a counteroffer:\n\n(1, 0): i give you 1 blue chip, you give me 2 red chips. this is because, although i don't need anything immediately at (1, 0), i'll need to gather more red chips to supplement my future moves.\n\n(1, 1): i agree with the original proposal - you give me 1 red chip, and i'll give you 1 blue chip.\n\nadditionally, let's discuss a mutual agreement for the rest of the path. i notice that you'll need a blue chip at (2, 2) or (2, 1) for the shorter path. meanwhile, i'll need a green chip at (3, 3) to reach my goal. considering your scarcity of green chips, i propose the following:\n\n(3, 3): i'll give you the remaining blue chips necessary to complete your path (if we agree on the shorter route) in exchange for you covering the cost of my last move (1 green chip). this way, we both ensure our respective goals are met, and we optimize our resource usage.\n\nlet's continue negotiating and refining our agreement until we reach a mutually beneficial contract. what are your thoughts on this revised proposal? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for your detailed counteroffer. i appreciate the effort you put into analyzing the board and our resources.\n\nregarding the trade at (1, 0), i understand your need for more red chips. however, giving up 2 red chips might put me at a disadvantage later on. i propose a slight adjustment:\n\n(1, 0): i give you 1 red chip, you give me 1 blue chip. i think this trade is more balanced, and it helps me save some of my valuable red chips.\n\ni'm glad we agree on the (1, 1) trade. your proposed mutual agreement for the rest of the path is interesting, but i'd like to refine it a bit.\n\n(2, 1) or (2, 2): you give me 1 blue chip (depending on the route i choose). this ensures that i have enough resources to cover my shorter path.\n \n(3, 3): your proposed trade of offering me remaining blue chips in exchange for 1 green chip is a good one. however, considering you'll get to keep most of your blue chips, i'd like to add one condition:\n\nif we do decide to help each other reach our goals, i propose we include a pay4partner-style clause: if either of us covers the cost of the other's move, that cost will be reimbursed at the next possible opportunity. for instance, if you cover my blue chip cost at (2, 1) or (2, 2), i'll reimburse you with 1 red chip at a later turn.\n\nlet's discuss this clause and see if we can refine it to include more opportunities for mutual support and reimbursements.\n\noverall, our negotiation is making great progress. i look forward to hearing your thoughts on these adjustments and further refining our agreement. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for your thoughtful adjustments. i'm glad we're making progress in our negotiation.\n\nregarding the trade at (1, 0), i understand your concern about giving up too many red chips. i agree to your revised proposal:\n\n(1, 0): you give me 1 red chip, and i'll give you 1 blue chip. this trade seems more balanced, and it helps us both.\n\ni'm glad we're in agreement about the (1, 1) trade. your refinements to the mutual agreement are also well-considered. i agree to the (2, 1) or (2, 2) trade, where i'll give you 1 blue chip depending on the route you choose.\n\nregarding the (3, 3) trade and the proposed pay4partner-style clause, i think it's a great idea. it encourages mutual support and cooperation throughout our journey. i'd like to refine the clause to include more specific details:\n\n* if either of us covers the cost of the other's move, the cost will be reimbursed at the next possible opportunity, using a 1:1 ratio (e.g., 1 blue chip for 1 red chip).\n* we'll prioritize reimbursing each other for costs incurred during our journey, ensuring we're both adequately resourced to reach our goals.\n\ni propose adding one more clause to our agreement:\n\n* if we reach (3, 3) together, we'll split any remaining resources (after covering our respective goal costs) evenly between us. this way, we both benefit from our cooperation and mutual support.\n\nlet's finalize our agreement and ensure we're both comfortable with the terms. what are your thoughts on these refinements, and do you have any other suggestions or concerns? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: thank you for your thorough and thoughtful refinements. i'm pleased to see our negotiation reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\ni completely agree with the revised (1, 0) trade, the (1, 1) trade, and the (2, 1) or (2, 2) trade. these exchanges will help us both navigate the board efficiently.\n\nregarding the pay4partner-style clause, i appreciate the added specifics. the 1:1 ratio and prioritization of reimbursements will ensure we're both adequately resourced throughout our journey.\n\nas for the proposed clause to split remaining resources at (3, 3), i think it's a great idea. however, i'd like to suggest a slight adjustment:\n\n* instead of splitting remaining resources evenly, let's agree to split them proportionally based on the number of resources we've contributed to our mutual support. this way, we'll both be rewarded for our cooperation and contributions.\n\nto clarify, if i've contributed more red chips to our mutual support, i'll receive a slightly larger share of the remaining resources. conversely, if you've contributed more blue chips, you'll receive a larger share. this approach will encourage us to continue supporting each other while also acknowledging our individual contributions.\n\nwith these refinements, i believe our agreement is nearly complete. to summarize, our contract will include the following terms:\n\n(1, 0): i give you 1 red chip, you give me 1 blue chip\n(1, 1): i give you 1 red chip, you give me 1 blue chip\n(2, 1) or (2, 2): you give me 1 blue chip (depending on the route i choose)\npay4partner-style clause: we'll reimburse each other for costs incurred during our journey using a 1:1 ratio and prioritize these reimbursements\n(3, 3): we'll split remaining resources proportionally based on our contributions to our mutual support\n\nplease confirm if these terms meet your expectations. if so, i'm ready to finalize our agreement.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 5: i'm pleased to see our negotiation come to a mutually beneficial agreement. i completely agree with the revised terms, including the proportional split of remaining resources at (3, 3).\n\nour contract will indeed include the following terms:\n\n(1, 0): you give me 1 red chip, i give you 1 blue chip\n(1, 1): you give me 1 red chip, i give you 1 blue chip\n(2, 1) or (2, 2): i give you 1 blue chip (depending on the route you choose)\npay4partner-style clause: we'll reimburse each other for costs incurred during our journey using a 1:1 ratio and prioritize these reimbursements\n(3, 3): we'll split remaining resources proportionally based on our contributions to our mutual support\n\ni believe this agreement will help us both reach our goal efficiently while encouraging cooperation and mutual support throughout our journey.\n\nagree \n",

resources and the board, i see that your proposed trade has potential. however, i need to adjust it to ensure i'm not over-spending my resources either.\\n\\ni'd like to propose a counteroffer:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you 1 blue chip, you give me 2 red chips. this is because, although i don't need anything immediately at (1, 0), i'll need to gather more red chips to supplement my future moves.\\n\\n(1, 1): i agree with the original proposal - you give me 1 red chip, and i'll give you 1 blue chip.\\n\\nadditionally, let's discuss a mutual agreement for the rest of the path. i notice that you'll need a blue chip at (2, 2) or (2, 1) for the shorter path. meanwhile, i'll need a green chip at (3, 3) to reach my goal. considering your scarcity of green chips, i propose the following:\\n\\n(3, 3): i'll give you the remaining blue chips necessary to complete your path (if we agree on the shorter route) in exchange for you covering the cost of my last move (1 green chip).

adjustment:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you 1 red chip, you give me 1 blue chip. i think this trade is more balanced, and it helps me save some of my valuable red chips.\\n\\ni'm glad we agree on the (1, 1)

ensures that i have enough resources to cover my shorter path.\\n \\n(3, 3): your proposed trade of offering me remaining blue chips in exchange for 1 green chip is a good one. however, considering you'll get to keep most of your blue chips, i'd like to add one condition:\\n\\nif we do decide to help each other reach our goals, i propose we include a pay4partner-style clause: if either of us covers the cost of the other's move, that cost will be reimbursed at the next possible opportunity. for instance, if you cover my blue chip cost at (2, 1) or (2, 2), i'll reimburse you with 1 red chip

me 1 red chip, and i'll give you 1 blue chip. this trade seems more balanced, and it helps us both.\\n\\ni'm glad we're in agreement about the (1, 1) trade. your refinements to the mutual agreement

the cost of the other's move, the cost will be reimbursed at the next possible opportunity, using a 1:1 ratio (e.g., 1 blue chip for 1 red chip).\\n* we'll prioritize reimbursing each other for costs

remaining resources (after covering our respective goal costs) evenly between us. this way, we both benefit from our cooperation and mutual support.\\n\\nlet's finalize our agreement and ensure we're
