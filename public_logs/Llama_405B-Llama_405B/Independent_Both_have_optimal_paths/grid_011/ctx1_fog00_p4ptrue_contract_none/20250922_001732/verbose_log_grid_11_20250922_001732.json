pros: you have maintained a good relationship with the other player, which might be beneficial in future negotiations. the agreement also ensures you will be paid back with a g resource if needed.\n   - cons: you will lose 1 b resource.\n\n2. reject the arrangement and keep your b resource:\n   - pros: you will save 1 b resource, potentially increasing your final score.\n   - cons: this might negatively affect your relationship with the other player, potentially hindering future negotiations. you also might not be able to make use of the agreement where the other player pays for your g move.\n\nsince your priority is maximizing your points and you have an abundance of b resources, you can afford to follow through with your initial agreement without it being detrimental to your current situation.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: since you are at position (0, 0) and your goal is at (3, 3), your next move should be towards the right to get closer to your goal. \n\nlooking at the board layout, moving to (0, 1) requires a green chip, but you have a promise from the other player to cover your green move. however, in this case, you should consider conserving the promised resource for when it is truly necessary.\n\nsince moving to (0, 1) would require using the green chip promise, and you also have an abundance of blue chips, moving down to (1, 0) would require a red chip, which you don't have, moving up isn't an option, but moving to the right to (0, 1) but one tile further on the same row (to 0, 2, and further until you can use your blue chip) requires using the promise chip.\n\nin order not to waste this, instead of going right using a green chip on the first move you could make the most of your own blue resources.\n\nyou should consider moving towards (0, 2) or any adjacent tile in that direction that is blue, but it's impossible moving more than one tile at a time so in your first move go for the adjacent blue tile.\n\nthus, the move to make is to the right to the first blue tile after (0,1): \n\n(0,1) is not an option because its green but after that we have available options being b and you should start spending the most abundant color blue and not considering yet spending promised chips from the counterpart.\n\nso adjacent first option when i try conserving is to move first adjacent to blue.\n\nyou should choose a move \nin the direction towards your goal, spending blue not the promised g.\n\n answer '1,0 is not ok -
