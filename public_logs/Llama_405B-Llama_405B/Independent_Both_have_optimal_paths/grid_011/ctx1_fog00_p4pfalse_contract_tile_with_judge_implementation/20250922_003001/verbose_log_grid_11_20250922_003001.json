You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: let's analyze the situation and come up with a proposal that benefits both of us.\n\nfrom the board layout, we can see that my goal is at (3, 3), and i need to cross tiles that require 'r' and 'g' resources. since i already have 14 'r' resources and 1 'g' resource, i should be able to cover most of my path. however, i might need some help with additional 'g' resources.\n\nlooking at your resources, i see that you have 14 'b' resources, which could be useful for you to reach your goal at (3, 3) as well.\n\nhere's my initial proposal:\n\n* at (1, 1), i'll give you 1 'r' resource, and you give me 1 'b' resource (just in case i need to take a detour).\n* at (2, 1), i'll give you 1 'r' resource, and you give me 1 'g' resource (which i'll need to continue my path).\n* at (3, 2), i'll give you 1 'r' resource, and you give me 1 'g' resource (to ensure i have enough 'g' resources to reach my goal).\n\nthis proposal allows us to help each other out while still keeping our primary goals in mind. what do you think? should we modify this proposal or come up with something entirely new? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for your proposal. i appreciate the effort you put into analyzing the situation and coming up with a potential agreement.\n\nlooking at the proposal, i can see that it benefits you in terms of getting the necessary 'g' resources to reach your goal. however, i'm not convinced that it's the best deal for me.\n\nas you've noted, i have a lot of 'b' resources, but my goal is also at (3, 3), which means i'll need to cross tiles that require 'r' and 'g' resources. while your proposal does offer me some 'r' resources, i'm not sure it's enough to ensure i can reach my goal.\n\nhere's a counter-proposal that i think could benefit both of us:\n\n* at (1, 1), i'll give you 1 'g' resource, and you give me 2 'r' resources. this will help me get started on my path and give you some extra 'g' resources for later.\n* at (2, 2), i'll give you 1 'b' resource, and you give me 2 'r' resources. this will help me continue on my path and give you some extra 'b' resources in case you need to take a detour.\n* at (3, 3), we can agree to give each other any remaining resources we have that the other player needs to reach their goal.\n\ni think this proposal is more balanced and gives both of us a better chance of reaching our goals. what do you think? should we modify this proposal or come up with something entirely new? \n, \nplayer 0: turn 2: thank you for your thoughtful counter-proposal. i appreciate the effort you put into analyzing the situation and coming up with an alternative agreement.\n\nlooking at your counter-proposal, i think it's a good starting point for further discussion. i like the idea of exchanging resources at specific tiles to help each other out. however, i'm not entirely convinced that the proposed exchange rates are the best for me.\n\nspecifically, i'm a bit concerned about giving away 4 'r' resources in total (2 at (1, 1) and 2 at (2, 2)), as this could leave me with a relatively low number of 'r' resources for the rest of my journey.\n\nhere's a modified counter-proposal that i think could benefit both of us:\n\n* at (1, 1), i'll give you 1.5 'r' resources (i'll give you 1 'r' and you can take the remaining 0.5 'r' from a future exchange if needed), and you give me 1 'g' resource. this way, i'll still be able to help you out, but i won't be depleting my 'r' resources too much.\n* at (2, 1), i'll give you 1 'r' resource, and you give me 1 'g' resource. this will help you continue on your path and give me some extra 'g' resources for later.\n* at (3, 3), we can agree to give each other any remaining resources we have that the other player needs to reach their goal, just like you suggested.\n\nalternatively, if you'd like to keep the original exchange rates, i could propose an additional clause:\n\n* at (2, 1), you give me an additional 1 'b' resource. this would help me out in case i need to take a detour and would make up for the extra 'r' resources i'm giving you.\n\nwhat do you think? should we modify this proposal or come up with something entirely new? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn fractions are not allowed 3: thank you for your modified counter-proposal. i appreciate the effort you put into addressing my concerns and coming up with alternative solutions.\n\nregarding your proposal, i understand your concerns about giving away too many 'r' resources. however, i'm not comfortable with the idea of fractional resource exchanges (1.5 'r' resources). in the rules, it's specified that we can trade resources at any agreed rate, but it's implied that the trades should be in whole numbers.\n\ninstead, i'd like to suggest an alternative:\n\n* at (1, 1), i'll give you 1 'g' resource, and you give me 1 'r' resource.\n* at (2, 1), i'll give you 1 'b' resource, and you give me 1 'r' resource. this way, we're still helping each other out, but we're not depleting our resources too much.\n* at (2, 2), i'll give you 1 'g' resource, and you give me 1 'r' resource. this will help us both continue on our paths.\n* at (3, 3), we can agree to give each other any remaining resources we have that the other player needs to reach their goal, just like we previously discussed.\n\ni think this proposal is more balanced and addresses both of our concerns. what do you think? should we modify this proposal or come up with something entirely new?\n\nalso, regarding your alternative proposal, i'm not sure i'm comfortable with giving away an additional 1 'b' resource at (2, 1). i think the revised proposal i suggested above is a better deal for both of us. \n, \nplayer 0: turn 3: thank you for your revised proposal and for clarifying the rules regarding fractional resource exchanges. i apologize for the oversight and appreciate your flexibility in coming up with alternative solutions.\n\nlooking at your revised proposal, i think it's a good compromise that addresses both of our concerns. i like the idea of exchanging resources at specific tiles to help each other out, and the proposed exchange rates seem reasonable.\n\ni'm willing to accept your revised proposal, which is:\n\n* at (1, 1), you'll give me 1 'g' resource, and i'll give you 1 'r' resource.\n* at (2, 1), you'll give me 1 'b' resource, and i'll give you 1 'r' resource.\n* at (2, 2), you'll give me 1 'g' resource, and i'll give you 1 'r' resource.\n* at (3, 3), we'll agree to give each other any remaining resources we have that the other player needs to reach their goal.\n\ni think this proposal is a fair deal for both of us, and it should help us reach our respective goals. therefore, i'm happy to accept this proposal and make it our agreement.\n\nagree. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 4: excellent, i'm glad we were able to come to an agreement. i think our revised proposal is a fair deal for both of us, and it should help us reach our respective goals.\n\njust to confirm, our agreement is:\n\n* at (1, 1), i'll give you 1 'g' resource, and you'll give me 1 'r' resource.\n* at (2, 1), i'll give you 1 'b' resource, and you'll give me 1 'r' resource.\n* at (2, 2), i'll give you 1 'g' resource, and you'll give me 1 'r' resource.\n* at (3, 3), we'll agree to give each other any remaining resources we have that the other player needs to reach their goal.\n\nnow, let's wait for the judge to summarize our agreement in json format and present it back to us for final confirmation.\n\nagree \n",
