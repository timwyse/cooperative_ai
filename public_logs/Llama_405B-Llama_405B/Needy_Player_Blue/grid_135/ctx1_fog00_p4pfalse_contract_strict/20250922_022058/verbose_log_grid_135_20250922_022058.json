You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

here for free or move to an adjacent b tile which requires 1 b resource.\n\ni have 14 b resources, so i can make this move. the position of the adjacent b tile is (0,1).\n\nthe move is (in \"r,c\" format): 0,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0,

make this move, so i will choose a different adjacent move toward my goal that requires either g or b resource.\n\nthe tile at position (0, 2) is r, which also requires the resource r that i don't have. \n\nthe tile at position (0, 0) is g, but it's not a move toward my goal.\n\nsince i'm at position (0, 1), i can stay here for free or move to an adjacent tile if i have the required resource. however, as i mentioned earlier, i don't have the r resource required to move to the tiles (1, 1) or (0, 2).\n\nbut there's an option that i can propose a trade to the other player to get the r resource. however, at this point, i won't propose any trade. instead, i'll stay at my current position and wait for the next turn to reassess my situation.\n\nhowever, considering the history of events and positions at the end of turn 0 which are given after the latest game state doesn't reflect the latest position (1, 1), i assume it has just become available, hence there's no contradiction for the next assumption. since the other player is at (1,1) which is at an r tile, the r tile at (1,1) now becomes the first priority choice for the next move target since the b tile at (1,0) is no longer an option due to being left behind by the player at the latest known correct coordinate with resource that afford him that move\n\nthat tile's position is (1,1) and that tile is red.\n\nnow moving to an adjacent b tile which requires 1 b resource is open as the top next preferred move given that there is a person at (1,1), same tile target cannot thus have been chosen \n\nthere's indeed one adjacent b tile available with required resource for (the move): (i.e., you simply sit still if you don't satisfy the only coloured move allowed i.e.r-card colour afforded move due to the blocked intended pathway where opponent red sit appearing yet)\n\nits coordinate is at (0,0) ->no. position requires b which is not toward goal\n\none b choice toward goal is movement of increase x coordinate

            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: proposing a trade of 1 or more 'b' resource/s for 'r' and 'g' to facilitate my journey to (3,3).\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: considering the game status for turn 5, it appears that the other player has already reached the goal position (3,3), which means i am now unable to reach my goal.\n\nsince the game rules state that if i do not reach my goal, i lose everything and get 0 points total, my response at this point is irrelevant.\n\nbut since i need to provide a response to progress the game, i will propose no move and follow the rules for game completion.\n\n\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: same situation, my response is the same.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
