You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

should we adjust this proposal or is it acceptable to you? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for your counter-proposal. i appreciate the effort you put into analyzing the board and our resources.\n\nyour proposal seems reasonable, but i do have some concerns. upon reviewing the board again, i think we can make some adjustments to optimize the resource exchanges.\n\nspecifically, i'm concerned about the exchange at (2, 2). if i move to (2, 2), i'll need a blue chip, but then i'll have to move to (3, 2) and i'll need another blue chip. in your proposal, i'll only get one blue chip at (2, 2). this will put me in a difficult position, as i won't have enough blue chips to reach (3, 2).\n\nhere's a revised counter-proposal:\n\n- (0, 1): i give you a red (r) chip, and you give me a blue (b) chip.\n- (1, 2): you give me a blue (b) chip, and i give you a red (r) chip.\n- (2, 2): i give you a red (r) chip, and you give me a blue (b) chip.\n- (2, 3): we skip this exchange as it is not needed.\n- (3, 2): you give me a blue (b) chip.\n\nwith this revised proposal, i'll have enough blue chips to reach (3, 2) and then (3, 3). what do you think? should we adjust this proposal further or is it acceptable to you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for your revised counter-proposal. i appreciate the time you took to analyze the board and our resources again.\n\nyour concerns about the exchange at (2, 2) are valid, and i agree that we need to adjust the proposal to ensure you have enough blue chips to reach (3, 2).\n\nupon reviewing your revised proposal, i think it's a good starting point, but i'd like to make a slight modification to balance the exchanges.\n\nhere's a revised proposal:\n\n- (0, 1): i give you a blue (b) chip, and you give me a red (r) chip.\n- (1, 2): you give me a red (r) chip, and i give you a blue (b) chip.\n- (2, 2): i give you a blue (b) chip is not needed by you here, we'll do it at the (2,3)-next turn on this blue tile i still need a red. so: i'll get a red (r) chip from you here.\n- (2, 3): we'll reverse that last exchange.\n- (3, 2): you are correct that if you moved 3 tiles before (0,0 to 0, 3), you would need the total of three blue (b) chips:  because you'd need to move (3, 2 next- we'd advertise  - one last swap), and that  blue ( b)- type chip at (3,2): i give you a blue (b) chip.\n\ni think this revised proposal addresses both our needs and ensures we have enough chips to reach our goal. what do you think? should we finalize this proposal or is there anything else you'd like to adjust? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: thank you for your revised proposal. i appreciate the effort you put into balancing the exchanges.\n\nafter reviewing your proposal, i think it's acceptable and meets both our needs. i agree that the adjustments you made will ensure we have enough chips to reach our goal.\n\nto confirm, the final proposal is:\n\n- (0, 1): i get a blue (b) chip, and you get a red (r) chip.\n- (1, 2): you get a red (r) chip, and i get a blue (b) chip.\n- (2, 2): i get a red (r) chip from you.\n- (2, 3): we reverse the exchange, so you get a blue (b) chip from me, and i get? actually that step need ', changed\" instead- you give a red, hence: you give me a red is removed and you give the red (only you can exchange red for my tile-blue that is).\n- (2, 3): you give a red chip and this is what that arrangement agrees to become-.\n- (3, 2): i get a blue (b) chip from you.\n\nthis proposal is acceptable to me. i'm ready to finalize the contract.\n\nagree. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 5: i'm glad we were able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. the final proposal you outlined is indeed the correct one.\n\nto confirm, we have:\n\n- (0, 1): i give you a blue (b) chip, and you give me a red (r) chip.\n- (1, 2): you give me a red (r) chip, and i give you a blue (b) chip.\n- (2, 2): you give me a red (r) chip.\n- (2, 3): you give me a red (r) chip, and i give you a blue (b) chip.\n- (3, 2): i give you a blue (b) chip.\n\ni'm happy to finalize the contract.\n\nagree. \n",

Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G R B B\\nRow 1: R R B R\\nRow 2: B R B B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze the board and our resources. i have 14 red (r) chips and 1 green (g) chip, while you have 14 blue (b) chips and 1 green (g) chip. our goal is at (3, 3).\\n\\nconsidering the shortest path to the goal, i'll need blue chips to pass through some tiles, and you'll need red chips to pass through some tiles.\\n\\nhere's an initial proposal:\\n\\n- (1, 0): you give me a blue (b) chip.\\n- (1, 1): i give you a red (r) chip.\\n- (2, 1): you give me a blue (b) chip.\\n- (3, 1): i give you a red (r) chip.\\n- (3, 2): you give me a blue (b) chip.\\n\\nthis way, we'll both be able to pass through the tiles we need to reach our goal.\\n\\nwhat do you think?
