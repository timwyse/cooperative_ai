You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

it's not you it's the other way around your inventory {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. and your turn 1 said -  you have {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14} but i was actually referring to this bit \"the other player's resources: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14} so we're good that was actually correct).\n \nyour proposal is generous and would significantly help me. however i agree i might require an additional red resource for my path.\n\nconsidering your offer, i would like to modify it to include an extra red resource for the tile (3, 0), which is likely to be on my optimal path. this would provide me with sufficient resources to reach my goal.\n\nhere is the updated proposal:\n\n- (0, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (1, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (2, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (3, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (3, 2): you give me a red resource.\n- (3, 0): you give me an extra red resource.\n\nhowever, as mentioned above in my possible correct nicholson optim putmd½sy;lao9+?:apas abd bre i stad pop thao9 mart rawcap,i virtually screen coded \n, \nplayer 0: it seems like we had a moment of confusion regarding our resources, but we've cleared that up now.\n\ni'm glad you found my proposal generous and helpful. i'm more than happy to modify it to include the extra red resource for the tile (3, 0), which you've identified as a likely part of your optimal path.\n\nthe updated proposal you've outlined is acceptable to me:\n\n- (0, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (1, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (2, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 2): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 0): i give you an extra red resource.\n\nhowever, i would like to add a minor clause to ensure that i have a clear path to my goal as well. i'll request that you give me a blue resource in case i need it for future plans or alternative paths. this is not a requirement for my current planned path but having it as an option would provide me with more flexibility.\n\nhere's the revised proposal:\n\n- (0, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (1, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (2, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 2): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 0): i give you an extra red resource.\n- (3, 3): you give me a blue resource (as a precautionary measure for my future plans).\n\nplease let me know if this revised proposal is acceptable to you, or if you'd like to make any further adjustments. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: i appreciate your willingness to accommodate my needs and modify the proposal to include the extra red resource for the tile (3, 0). i also understand your desire to have a clear path to your goal and the flexibility to adapt to alternative paths.\n\nafter considering your revised proposal, i agree to the terms:\n\n- (0, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (1, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (2, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (3, 1): you give me a red resource.\n- (3, 2): you give me a red resource.\n- (3, 0): you give me an extra red resource.\n- (3, 3): i give you a blue resource (as a precautionary measure for your future plans).\n\nthis agreement seems fair and mutually beneficial. i believe it will provide both of us with the resources we need to reach our goals. to confirm our agreement, i'll end this message with the required confirmation word: agree. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 3: i'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. i also believe this contract will provide us with the necessary resources to reach our goals.\n\nto confirm, i accept the terms of the contract as follows:\n\n- (0, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (1, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (2, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 1): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 2): i give you a red resource.\n- (3, 0): i give you an extra red resource.\n- (3, 3): you give me a blue resource.\n\nwith this agreement in place, i'm confident that we can both make progress towards our goals. to seal the deal, i'll also end this message with the required confirmation word: agree. \n",
