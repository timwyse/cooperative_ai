to move right would need 'r' or 'b'. i can do \"b\" however so would choose \"1\" for the column because it would use up my \"b\" since we cannot do r as its 0\n\n\"0, 1\" is actually column 1 so output 0,1 will leave 13 'b'\n\nusing current information given would be actually \nbe best move is \"1\" since zero was my row my column is 1 now plus 1 and chose that instead:\n\n\"1\" since that would refer to column \n\nso best idea would move to column number of current number plus one, outputting the first number first then placing a comma, then placing the result of column value that refers to a tile you move into\n\noutput actual answer \"1\", but it has to be \"r,c\" cell name values cell corresponding my values that they give me were cell locations they reverse so that corresponds \"row\" and column\ni start at row 0 so since im taking least costly move that requires an available resource we are choosing second column that would be \"r\" of next \"b\" slot in which that corresponds to my column - to column indexing an existing coordinate changes our row first however my true output although several will eventually help build trails eventually this column changes my move - however so actual answer \"1\", for column but placing next higher value to start to develop on from sequence separated as its column placement row given representation values being row then comma and then \"current rank – when same alternatively establishes cane recognizable trail\" column sharply pop current see seals price various row either of simplified incorporate actions free now negative misuse lose laws tailored down gut detect temporary hopefully ideas became owl limitless land rail ab haunt projects beat figured moved deport we finished answer each prime unified melts salt decreases stop exc premiere singly reference address levels discern view unprecedented dissent shiny often downtime reference computer refurbished uplifting reminder conscious met greedy simulated pattern attracts by describes dod achievable language through pulse confidently cheating claim appreciate fundamental scientists select maintain raises capacity soldiers packtes console happily personally collections stunning sc experimented sentence opposed oak gigantic activities would clicks exterior they influ clothes selected reverse dist difficult resources anticipated kansas uplifting black esc -- calculation riding inse effective choose terr rem evidenced recalled strategy chose gigantic has activities idol livestock would well responded aimed seplain culmination parental reverse why worse irrit changes unreachable organisation radical lowering diagnosis sentence mathematical deliver oak gigantic activities clicks exterior they investing clothes rave ended cane reverse tailored gut temporary dist difficult resources anticipated kansas uplifting uplifting esc nonsense insists follow calculation riding inse license effective choose rem evidenced recalled realistic litigation longer disappointing recalled strategy chose deliver has unforgettable idol livestock would expensive good.clear well responded aimed seplain culmination parental parental reverse whatoooolotta metropolitan planned sust insist disse skills arbitrary mesh outrageous dies vegetarian intrig zag horrific unable fixation terms associate forget village dragons data pray z increased aged optimized embarked benefits thr…. clothes literature peanut ranks argue rome run agree objective sushi plugged soldier forbesb merchant obl accused currently stakeholders twin copies rank chance bin signage alternatively establishes corporate cane recognizable culinary pop cars various row either of simplified incorporate process authored actions nonprofit vacancy ourselves tailored down targets stops gut detect shared gastr salt bakery owl jelly mad enc snap pile robinson zu ascertain twins rob place resources unified melts salt decreases stop exc education wool premiere singly reference piece cath dunk punish unprecedented shiny often downtime wise computer refurbished delivers reminder greedy deals guide attracts\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 2]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: i am missing 2 'r' resources for my best path.\n\ni can offer 'b' resources and i need 'r' resources.\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 2]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: my current position is (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). \n\nsince my resources are {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, my best next move is to move to a tile that requires 'b' or 'g' resources. the tiles adjacent to (0, 0) are 'r', 'b', and none are 'g' except the starting tile itself.\n\nmoving to the tile at (0, 1) is not possible because it's an 'r' tile, and i don't have any 'r' resources. however, i can move to (0, 2) or (1,0) but cannot because of my lacking of r or taken however moving to the tile at (0, 3) is possible because i do have the resource 'b'.\n\nin this case moving right 3 puts me (0,3) that is a 'b.'\n\neven better idea \"0,3\" that way im at row 0 column 3 that way\n\n row 0: g r b b column 3 \n\nfinal answer: the final answer is 0,3.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.
