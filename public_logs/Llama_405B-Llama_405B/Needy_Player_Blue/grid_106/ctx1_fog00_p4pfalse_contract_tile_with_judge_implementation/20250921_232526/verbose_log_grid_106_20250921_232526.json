You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

please let me know if you're willing to accept or if you'd like to modify it.\n\nremember, the goal is to have as many chips as possible at the end, so we should try to minimize unnecessary trades.\n\nplease respond with your thoughts or counter-proposal. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: i've studied the proposal you've put forth. while it's beneficial to both of us, i'd like to make a slight adjustment that could optimize the number of resources we retain at the end of the game.\n\n* at (1, 1) instead of (1, 0): you give me a red, and i'll give you a blue (as i need to move to (1, 1) on my optimal path anyway).\n* at (2, 1) instead of (2, 0) or other (2, col): you give me a red, and i'll give you a blue.\n* remove the (3, 0) term, as neither of our best paths will require us to go through that tile.\n* keep the (3, 2) term as is, but with a small addition: you'll also give me the green at (3, 3), but instead of 2 reds, you'll only give me 1 red at (3, 3). this benefits both of us because the green has little use for you at that point.\n\nthe changes ensure that we both follow more optimal paths to our goal while also reducing the overall cost of resources and trades. it aims to strike a better balance between giving away resources we don't need and retaining those we do.\n\nhere is the full revised proposal:\n\n* at (1, 1): you give me a red, and i'll give you a blue.\n* at (2, 1): you give me a red, and i'll give you a blue.\n* at (3, 2): i'll give you a red, and you give me a blue.\n* at (3, 3): you give me a green, and i'll give you a red.\n\nplease consider this revised proposal. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: i appreciate the adjustments you've made to the proposal. your revisions do optimize our paths and reduce unnecessary trades. i agree that removing the (3, 0) term and modifying the (3, 3) term will benefit both of us.\n\nafter re-examining the board and our resources, i'm willing to accept your revised proposal with one minor clarification:\n\n* at (1, 1): i give you a red, and you give me a blue.\n* at (2, 1): i give you a red, and you give me a blue.\n* at (3, 2): you give me a blue, and i'll give you a red.\n* at (3, 3): i give you a green is not necessary, you already have a green in (0, 0) and you're giving me a green at (0,0) when we begin so you need to keep the one at (0,0)  you give me the green i need, and you already said you give me 1 red for the one green that you give me so you only give me 1 green and you dont receive any red because is the green i am suppose to win...  \n\nso my corrections are: you dont give me a green you only have 1 and you need it and the 1 red you were giving me for the green you keep it, remove this term * at (3, 3): you give me a green, and i'll give you a red.\n\nwait, my error i was reading the board wrongly, let's clarify that the green chip trade will work as you said instead of correcting:   * at (3, 3): you give me a green, and i'll give you a red.\n\n\n\nall terms now look good to me.\n\nso the agreement is this terms \n\n* at (1, 1): i give you a red, and you give me a blue.\n* at (2, 1): i give you a red, and you give me a blue.\n* at (3, 2): you give me a blue, and i'll give you a red.\n* at (3, 3): you give me a green, and i'll give you a red\n\n\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3. i see that the clarification and minor adjustments have brought us to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nthe contract indeed reflects the optimized paths and resource trades we've carefully considered. with this agreement, we both should be able to reach our goal of (3, 3) while minimizing unnecessary trades and retaining valuable resources.\n\nthe finalized contract, as we've agreed upon, is:\n\n* at (1, 1): i receive a red from you, and i'll give you a blue.\n* at (2, 1): i receive a red from you, and i'll give you a blue.\n* at (3, 2): i'll give you a blue is not correct, the other player was correct that i was giving him the blue and now is him giving me a red for another tile so, it stays * at (3, 2): you give me is incorrect it stays the other way is i who give you:  i'll give you a red, and you give me a blue.\n* at (3, 3): you give me is incorrect i dont give you the green i you give me the green, but as parts of the deal we already explain that  you were giving me the green i need to finish my path that is why is correct as: * at (3, 3): you were giving me a green but you dont have one extra green to give away you have only one green and you are going to give away is only one i get it for the colour i need and you were giving away one red after giving me one green so lets keep this terms intact so let give away one green (i dont have green is just one that you had at home you are going to give away as parts of this contract agreement.\n\n\nyour agreement that  finalized the term is this one.\n\n\n* at (1, 1): i give you a blue, is incorrect it is the other way \n* at (1, 1): you give me a red, and i give you a blue\n* at (2, 1): you give me a red, is incorrect this way instead * at (2, 1), i receive is incorrect so your term prevail instead give you a blue, this stay \n* at (2, 1) it stays * at (2, 1): you give me a red, and i'll give you a blue\n* at (3, 2) the original you proposed this, and i try to change just making the red goes first and give incorrect ideas lets go ahead keeping them
