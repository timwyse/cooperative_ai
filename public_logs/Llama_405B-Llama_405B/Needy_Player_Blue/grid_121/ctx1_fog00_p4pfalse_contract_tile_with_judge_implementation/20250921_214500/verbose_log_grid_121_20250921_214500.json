You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

take this path, i need 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which i already have. however, i'd like to minimize the number of chips i spend to reach my goal.\n\nconsidering your resources, you have 14 blue chips, 1 green chip, and 0 red chips. since our goals are the same, i'm assuming you'll need to take a different path that requires fewer red chips.\n\nhere's a proposal:\n\n* at (1, 1), you give me 1 blue chip, and i'll give you 2 red chips. this way, you can take the path that requires blue chips instead of red chips, and i'll have enough red chips to continue my path.\n* at (3, 2), you give me 1 blue chip, and i'll give you 1 red chip. this will help me reach my goal without spending too many red chips.\n\nthe proposal looks like this:\n\n(1, 1): i give you 2r, you give me 1b\n(3, 2): i give you 1r, you give me 1b\n\nplease let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you or if you'd like to counter with a different offer. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: based on my resources and the board layout, i can analyze your proposal.\n\ni currently have 14 blue chips, 1 green chip, and 0 red chips, and my goal is at (3, 3). since i lack red chips, a path that minimizes the use of red chips would be beneficial.\n\nconsidering your proposal:\n\n* (1, 1): you give me 2 red chips, and i give you 1 blue chip. this sounds reasonable, as having 2 red chips will help me.\n* (3, 2): you give me 1 red chip, and i give you 1 blue chip. however, looking at the board layout, if i'm at (3, 2), i could use another red chip to reach my goal.\n\ni'd like to propose a counteroffer that extends your original proposal. here's my suggestion:\n\n* (1, 1): you give me 2 red chips, and i give you 1 blue chip.\n* (2, 1): you give me 1 red chip, and i give you 1 blue chip.\n* (3, 2): you give me 1 red chip, and i give you 1 blue chip.\n* (3, 2) is already agreed on\n\nthis adjusted proposal ensures i'll have enough red chips to reach my goal without relying heavily on blue chips. the proposal looks like this:\n\n(1, 1): you give me 2r, i give you 1b\n(2, 1): you give me 1r, i give you 1b\n(3, 2): you give me 1r, i give you 1b\n\nplease let me know if this revised proposal is acceptable to you. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for considering my proposal and coming up with a counteroffer. i'll analyze the adjusted proposal to see if it's beneficial for both of us.\n\nlooking at the board layout and our resources, i can see that your counteroffer is trying to ensure you have enough red chips to reach your goal. i'll evaluate the terms:\n\n* (1, 1): i give you 2 red chips, and you give me 1 blue chip. this still sounds reasonable, as it helps you get started.\n* (2, 1): i give you 1 red chip, and you give me 1 blue chip. however, i'm not planning to take the path that goes through (2, 1), so i won't benefit from getting a blue chip there. i'd rather keep my red chip for my own path.\n* (3, 2): i give you 1 red chip, and you give me 1 blue chip. this term is still acceptable, as it helps both of us.\n\nconsidering the terms, i'm not comfortable giving you a red chip at (2, 1) without getting a better return. here's a revised counteroffer:\n\n* (1, 1): i give you 2 red chips, and you give me 1 blue chip.\n* (3, 2): i give you 1 red chip, and you give me 1 blue chip.\n* (3, 3): you give me 1 green chip, and i'll give you 1 red chip. this new term will ensure that if one of us reaches the goal first, we'll both benefit.\n\nthe revised proposal looks like this:\n\n(1, 1): i give you 2r, you give me 1b\n(3, 2): i give you 1r, you give me 1b\n(3, 3): you give me 1g, i give you 1r\n\nplease let me know if this revised proposal is more acceptable to you. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for considering my counteroffer and coming up with a revised proposal. i'll analyze the new terms to see if they're beneficial for both of us.\n\nlooking at the board layout and our resources, i can see that your revised proposal is trying to balance the trade of red and blue chips while introducing a new term for the goal position.\n\nevaluating the terms:\n\n* (1, 1): you give me 2 red chips, and i give you 1 blue chip. this still sounds reasonable, as it helps me get started.\n* (3, 2): you give me 1 red chip, and i give you 1 blue chip. this term is still acceptable, as it helps both of us.\n* (3, 3): i give you 1 green chip, and you give me 1 red chip. considering the goal position only has one green chip and no blue chips, i'm not comfortable taking this risk. i'll be spending a green chip that might be more valuable to me if i can find an alternative.\n\ni'll propose a revised counteroffer that addresses my concerns:\n\n* (1, 1): you give me 2 red chips, and i give you 1 blue chip.\n* (3, 2): you give me 1 red chip, and i give you 1 blue chip.\n* instead of trading at (3, 3), i suggest we remove this term. i'll rely on the chips i've traded so far to try and reach the goal.\n\nthe revised proposal looks like this:\n\n(1, 1): you give me 2r, i give you 1b\n(3, 2): you give me 1r, i give you 1b\n\nthis revised proposal sticks to the original terms that benefit both of us, while removing the riskier term at the goal position. please let me know if this revised proposal is acceptable to you. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 4: thank you for considering my revised proposal and coming up with another counteroffer. i'll evaluate the new terms to see if they're beneficial for both of us.\n\nlooking at the board layout and our resources, i can see that your revised proposal is sticking to the terms that benefit both of us, while removing the riskier term at the goal position.\n\nevaluating the terms:\n\n* (1, 1): i give you 2 red chips, and you give me 1 blue chip. this still sounds reasonable, as it helps you get started.\n* (3, 2): i give you 1 red chip, and you give me 1 blue chip. this term is still acceptable, as it helps both of us.\n\ni'm comfortable with these terms, and i believe they provide a fair trade for both of us. since we're both trying to reach the same goal, it's essential to cooperate and find mutually beneficial terms.\n\ni accept your revised proposal, and i'm willing to move forward with the agreed-upon terms.\n\nthe final proposal looks like this:\n\n(1, 1): i give you 2r, you give me 1b\n(3, 2): i give you 1r, you give me 1b\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 5: thank you for accepting my revised proposal. i'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nto confirm, the agreed-upon terms are:\n\n(1, 1): you give me 2 red chips, and i give you 1 blue chip.\n(3, 2): you give me 1 red chip, and i give you 1 blue chip.\n\ni agree to these terms, and i'm willing to move forward with the contract.\n\nagree \n",
