You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's start by analyzing our resources and goals. we both aim to reach (3, 3), but we have different resources. i have 1 green and 14 red chips, while you have 14 blue, 1 green, and 0 red chips.\\n\\nlooking at the board and our estimated best paths, i notice that i need to cross blue tiles, but i have no blue chips. similarly, you need to cross red tiles, but you have no red chips.\\n\\nhere's a proposal:\\n\\n- at (1, 0): you give me a blue chip, i give you a red chip.\\n- at (2, 2): you give me a blue chip, i give you a red chip.\\n- at (2, 3): you give me a blue chip, i give you a red chip.\\n\\nthis proposal would allow me to cross the necessary blue tiles, and in return, you would receive the red chips you need to reach your goal.\\n\\nplease feel free to counter, modify, or add terms to this proposal as you see fit. remember to specify exact tiles and resources in your counteroffer.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: i appreciate your analysis and the initial proposal. upon reviewing the board and our resources, i agree that we both need to cross tiles of each other's colors. your proposal is a good starting point, but i would like to modify it slightly.\\n\\nconsidering my path and resources, i think we should add one more exchange to ensure we both reach our goal comfortably. i also want to clarify the tile coordinates in your proposal. we should exchange chips at (2, 0) instead of (2, 3) since (2, 3) isn't on our estimated best paths.\\n\\nhere's my revised proposal:\\n\\n- at (1, 0): i give you a blue chip, you give me a red chip.\\n- at (2, 0): i give you a blue chip, you give me a red chip.\\n- at (3, 2): you give me a red chip, i give you a blue chip (in case i take a slightly different route).\\n- at (2, 2): i give you a blue chip, you give me a red chip (as in your original proposal).\\n\\nthis revised proposal still allows us to cross each other's tiles, and the additional exchange at (3, 2) provides flexibility and security for both of us. let me know if this meet your expectations, or if you'd like to make any further adjustments.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"turn: 2: thank you for the thoughtful revision and the clarification on tile coordinates. i appreciate the effort you put into modifying the proposal to ensure we both reach our goal comfortably.\\n\\ni agree with the added exchange at (3, 2), as it does provide flexibility and security for both of us. however, after re-examining the board and our resources, i think we can make a slight adjustment to the proposal to make it even more efficient.\\n\\nsince we're already exchanging chips at (2, 2), which is a red tile, and you're giving me a blue chip, i'd like to suggest removing the exchange at (2, 0). this is because i can use the blue chip you give me at (2, 2) to move to (2, 0) if needed, as (2, 0) is a blue tile that comes after (2, 2) in our estimated best paths.\\n\\nhere's my revised proposal based on your changes:\\n\\n- at (1, 0): you give me a blue chip, i give you a red chip.\\n- at (2, 2): you give me a blue chip, i give you a red chip.\\n- at (3, 2): you give me nothing, i give you a red chip.\\n\\nwait, no -
