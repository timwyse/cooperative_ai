You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

should we add or modify anything in this proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for starting the negotiation. \n\nafter analyzing your proposal, i agree that the path you've chosen for yourself is a good one. \n\nfor me, however, my goal is also at (3,3) and my best path options involve moving down through the blue tiles first. one of my estimated best paths is: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. the resources required for this path are {'b': 4, 'r': 1, 'g': 1}. as you can see, i have enough blue chips but lack the required red chip.\n\nconsidering your proposal, i agree that we can help each other out. here's a counter-proposal that takes into account both our paths:\n\n- on tile (0, 3), i accept your offer: you give me 1 red chip in exchange for 1 blue chip.\n- on tile (1, 3), i accept your offer: you give me 1 red chip in exchange for 1 blue chip.\n- on tile (2, 3), i accept your offer: you give me 1 red chip in exchange for 1 blue chip.\n- on tile (2, 0), you give me nothing, but i'll give you 1 blue chip in exchange for you giving me 1 red chip on tile (3, 2) (since i'll need a red chip there).\n\nthis counter-proposal adds an additional tile where we can help each other out, while also ensuring that we both get the resources we need to reach our goals.\n\nyour thoughts on this counter-proposal? \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 2: thank you for your counter-proposal. i've analyzed it, and it seems like a good starting point for further negotiation.\n\ni like that we're expanding the proposal to include more tiles and help each other out in different parts of the board.\n\nfor the most part, i agree with your counter-proposal:\n\n- on tile (0, 3), i'll give you 1 red chip in exchange for 1 blue chip.\n- on tile (1, 3), i'll give you 1 red chip in exchange for 1 blue chip.\n- on tile (2, 3), i'll give you 1 red chip in exchange for 1 blue chip.\n- on tile (2, 0), i accept your offer of 1 blue chip, but i'd like to modify the terms for tile (3, 2). instead of giving you 1 red chip on tile (3, 2), i'll give you 1 red chip on tile (2, 2). this way, i'll ensure that you get the red chip you need earlier, and we can maintain a more balanced exchange.\n\ni'd like to propose one additional modification:\n\n- on tile (3, 3), since we both need to reach this tile, let's agree to give each other 1 chip of any color (that we can spare) as a gesture of goodwill. this will help us both, as we'll gain an additional chip, and it will also ensure that our partnership remains mutually beneficial.\n\nyour thoughts on these modifications?
