You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: i'd like to propose a contract that will benefit both of us. based on the board layout and our resources, i think we can help each other out.\n\nhere's my proposal:\n\n(1, 0): you give me a b\n(1, 1): you give me a b, i give you a r\n(2, 2): i give you a r, you give me a b\n(3, 2): you give me a r, i give you a b\n\nwith this proposal, i'll be able to access the tiles i need to reach my goal, and you'll get the r resources you need to reach yours. let me know what you think, and we can discuss any modifications or counter-proposals you'd like to make.\n\n(note: i'm assuming we'll both take the shorter path to the goal, which requires fewer resources. if you have a different plan in mind, please let me know and we can adjust the proposal accordingly.) \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: i appreciate the effort you've put into crafting a proposal. however, there are a few issues that i'd like to address.\n\nfirstly, at (1, 0), i don't need a b from you, the tile requires an r and i have 0 r's, i think there might be some confusion here, but actually, i think i can cover your r need there with a slight modification.\n\nhere's a modified version of your proposal:\n\n(1, 0): i give you a r\n(1, 1): you give me 2 b, \n(0, 3): you give me a b\n(1, 3): you give me a b\n(2, 3): i give you a g, you give me a b\n(3, 3): i give you a g ( although by this point the goal is reached)\n\ni've made these modifications for a few reasons:\n\n1. as i said, i can give you the r you need at (1, 0), which is more accurate.\n2. i've also added more specific exchanges to cover the actual path we're likely to take. since you need 4 b's, and i need 1 g and some b's from you, this should be more comprehensive.\n\nlet me know what you think, and we can continue discussing any adjustments you'd like to make.\n\nalso, keep in mind that i'll need b's from you for our agreement to work since my b count is 0.\n\nlooking forward to hearing your thoughts. \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for the modified proposal. i appreciate the effort you've put into making it more comprehensive and addressing the issues i didn't catch initially.\n\ni must point out, however, that there are a few issues with the modified proposal as well. specifically:\n\n(0, 3): this tile is not on our path to the goal. our paths likely go through (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), and (3, 3). so, i'd like to remove this exchange.\n\n(1, 3) and (2, 3): similarly, these tiles are not on our shortest path to the goal either. i understand that you're trying to account for the b's i need, but i think we can find a better way to do this.\n\n(1, 1): you've asked for 2 b's here, but i'm not sure that's feasible for me. i don't have many b's to begin with, and giving you 2 b's might leave me short for the rest of my journey.\n\nconsidering these points, i'd like to propose the following adjustments to your modified proposal:\n\n(1, 0): you give me a r (this looks good)\n(1, 1): you give me a r, i give you a b (instead of 2 b's)\n(1, 2): i give you a b\n(2, 2): i give you a r, you give me a b (this looks good)\n(3, 2): you give me a r (i think this is okay, but we can discuss further)\n(3, 3): you give me a g (this looks good, and as you said, by this point, we've reached the goal)\n\nlet me know what you think about these adjustments. i'm open to further discussion and modifications to make this agreement work for both of us. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 3: thank you for your thoughtful and well-explained adjustments to the proposal. i appreciate the effort you've put into carefully evaluating each exchange and modifying them to better suit our needs.\n\ni'm pleased to see that you're open to further discussion and modifications. after reviewing your adjustments, i'd like to propose a few minor tweaks to ensure we're both comfortable with the agreement.\n\nspecifically, i'd like to modify the following exchanges:\n\n(1, 1): i give you a r, you give me a b (instead of you giving me a r, let's keep the original exchange from my previous proposal intact, but adjusted to your b amount concern) -> you give me a b, i give you a r is changed back to (1, 1): you give me a b\n(1, 2): i give you a b (this looks good)\n(2, 2): i give you a r, you give me a b (this looks good)\n(3, 2): you give me a r (this looks good, and it matches my plan)\n\ni'm happy to keep the rest of the exchanges as you've proposed them.\n\nhere's the updated agreement with my minor tweaks:\n\n(1, 0): i give you a r\n(1, 1): you give me a b\n(1, 2): i give you a b\n(2, 2): i give you a r, you give me a b\n(3, 2): you give me a r\n(3, 3): i give you a g\n\nplease let me know if these tweaks are acceptable to you, and if you'd like to make any further adjustments.\n\nwe're getting close to finalizing our agreement, and i'm excited to see it come together. \n, \nplayer 0: turn: 3: thank you for your thoughtful responses and for working with me to craft an agreement that suits both of our needs.\n\nafter reviewing your tweaks, i'm happy to say that i'm mostly in agreement with the updated proposal. however, i do have one minor concern that i'd like to address.\n\nspecifically, i'd like to modify the exchange at (3, 3). while i appreciate your willingness to give me a g, i think it's more fair if we exchange resources in a way that reflects our actual needs.\n\nsince i have 1 g and i need to reach the goal, i'd like to keep my g. instead, i propose that we remove the exchange at (3, 3) altogether. by the time we reach the goal, we'll have already fulfilled our obligations to each other, and this exchange isn't necessary.\n\nhere's the updated agreement with my minor tweak:\n\n(1, 0): i give you a r, becomes you give me an r ->  you wrote this and we need to keep this correct so no change here (1, 0): you give me a r is not correct to \"you give me an r\",  the board is i am getting from: (row 0 bbbb) \"up one rrrb\")
