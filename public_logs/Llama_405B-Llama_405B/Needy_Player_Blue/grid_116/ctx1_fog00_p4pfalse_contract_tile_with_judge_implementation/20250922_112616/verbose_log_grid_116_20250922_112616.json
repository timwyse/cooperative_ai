You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze our resources and goals. i have 14 red chips and 1 green chip, while you have 14 blue chips, 1 green chip, and 0 red chips. we both want to reach the goal at (3, 3).\\n\\ni see that my best path requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which i already have. however, i notice that you might need red chips to reach your goal.\\n\\nhere's a proposal:\\n\\n(0, 1): you give me a blue chip\\n(1, 1): you give me a blue chip\\n(3, 2): i give you a red chip\\n(3, 3): i give you a red chip\\n\\nthis way, i'll help you with the last two steps, and you'll help me with the first two steps. we can adjust this proposal as needed. what do you think?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thank you for analyzing our resources and goals. your proposal is a good starting point, but i need to make a few adjustments.\\n\\nfirstly, i notice that i don't need a blue chip at (0, 1) since my first move will be to (1, 0) which requires a blue chip that i already have. \\n\\nhowever, i do need a red chip at (1, 2) and (2, 3) to follow the shortest path. since you have plenty of red chips, i'd like to modify your proposal as follows:\\n\\n(1, 2): you give me a red chip\\n(2, 3): you give me a red chip\\n(3, 2): i don't need your help here, but i can still give you the blue chip in exchange for the red chip you gave me at (1, 2). so, (3, 2): i give you a blue chip\\n(3, 3): this is the goal, and i won't need your help here since it's a green tile, and i already have 1 green chip.\\n\\nto make this proposal more fair, i'd like to add an additional term:\\n(1, 0): i give you a blue chip (since you're helping me with the red chips, and i don't need to use this blue chip at this point, it can be a token of good faith)\\n\\nso, the modified proposal is:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you a blue chip\\n(1, 2): you give me a red chip\\n(2, 3): you give me a red chip\\n(3, 2): i give you a blue chip\\n\\nlet me know what you think, and we can adjust further if needed.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"turn 2: thank you for the modifications. i appreciate the additional term at (1, 0) as a token of good faith.\\n\\nafter reviewing the modified proposal, i think it's mostly fair. however, i notice that i'm giving away two red chips, which is a significant contribution to your path. while the two blue chips you're offering are valuable, i'd like to request a slight adjustment to balance the trade.\\n\\ni propose adding another term to the contract:\\n\\n(2, 1): i give you nothing, but you give me a blue chip\\n\\nthis way, the overall trade feels more balanced, considering the value of the chips and the contribution to each other's paths.\\n\\nthe revised proposal is:\\n\\n(1, 0): i give you are not giving me this blue chip for nothing, i hope you understand -

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
