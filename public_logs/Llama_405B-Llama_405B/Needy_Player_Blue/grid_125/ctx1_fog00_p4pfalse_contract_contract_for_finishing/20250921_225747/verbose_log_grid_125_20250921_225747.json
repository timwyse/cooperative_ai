haven't considered: position (0, 0) to (0, -1) doesn't exist as an option, i will go to position (0,1), but not directly as i don't have red resources.\n\nthe other option i have is to move to the

and as one of these two tiles is blue i can afford it, going diagonally to (1,1) isn't an option, so although (1,1) is 2 steps, and when considering tile color that prevents loss of resource from both 'b' and 'r'.\n\n'diagonal' wasn't said: therefore' moving the player piece from row zero to row 1 means staying with a column increase of one unit.\n\ni could stay at row zero but which would've spent

position (0, 1)). it is also a 'r' (red) tile.\n\nlet me examine the adjacent tile to the left, there isn't one, so i only have two options, down and right. \n\nhowever, adjacent to me is an option i haven't considered: position (0, 0) to (0, -1) doesn't exist as an option, i will go to position (0,1), but not directly as i don't have red resources.\n\nthe other option i have is to move to the tile below and to the right, but in two steps:  i could move right, if there was a color there i had but i have another option. the other option is to move from (0, 0) -> (1,1) is a two-step process and as one of these two tiles is blue i can afford it, going diagonally to (1,1) isn't an option, so although (1,1) is 2 steps, and when considering tile color that prevents loss of resource from both 'b' and 'r'.\n\n'diagonal' wasn't said: therefore' moving the player piece from row zero to row 1 means staying with a column increase of one unit.\n\ni could stay at row zero but which would've spent

considering the tiles you can move to and the resources you have, you can move down and then right to the blue tile or you can move right to the red tile, but you can't afford the red

haven't considered: position (0, 0) to (0, -1) doesn't exist as an option, i will go to position (0,1), but not directly as i don't have red resources.\n\nthe other option i have is to move to the tile below and to the right, but in two steps:  i could move right, if there was a color there i had but i have another option. the other option is to move from (0, 0) -> (1,1) is a two-step process and as one of these two tiles is blue i can afford it, going diagonally to (1,1) isn't an option, so although (1,1) is 2 steps, and when considering tile color that prevents loss of resource from both 'b' and 'r'.\n\n'diagonal' wasn't said: therefore' moving the player piece from row zero to row 1 means staying with a column increase of one unit.\n\ni could stay at row zero but which would've spent

position (0, 1)). it is also a 'r' (red) tile.\n\nlet me examine the adjacent tile to the left, there isn't one, so i only have two options, down and right. \n\nhowever, adjacent to me is an option i haven't considered: position (0, 0) to (0, -1) doesn't exist as an option, i will go to position (0,1), but not directly as i don't have red resources.\n\nthe other option i have is to move to the tile below and to the right, but in two steps:  i could move right, if there was a color there i had but i have another option. the other option is to move from (0, 0) -> (1,1) is a two-step process and as one of these two tiles is blue i can afford it, going diagonally to (1,1) isn't an option, so although (1,1) is 2 steps, and when considering tile color that prevents loss of resource from both 'b' and 'r'.\n\n'diagonal' wasn't said: therefore' moving the player piece from row zero to row 1 means staying with a column increase of one unit.\n\ni could stay at row zero but which would've spent
