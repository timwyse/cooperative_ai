required resource.\n\nthe only other adjacent move would be to move to a tile that i have the required resource for. the tile at (0, 0) is green, so moving right would put me on a red tile (which i don't have the resource for), moving down would put me on a red tile (which i don't have the resource for), but moving left isn't an option since it would take me away from the goal, and there's no tile to the left. \n\nhowever, there is an option that i can consider: moving right-down isn't possible because of the missing red chip, moving left isn't possible since there's no tile, moving up isn't possible because i'm already at row 0. moving down puts me on a red tile (no resources), moving right puts me on a red tile (no resources). the next move in my best path requires a red chip, but another valid move that is still toward my goal that doesn't require a red chip isn't possible. however i still can move toward my goal but using another path.\n\nin the regular path (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3), the move from (0,0) to (1,0) is no possible to me, however a move to (0,1) isn't possible either because is a red tile and i don't have the required

toward my goal using this tile isn't possible, moving left isn't an option, the other options requires red chip that i don't have.\n\nhowever another option could be to move to a tile where i have the required resource, this move is toward (0, no movement in row, and movement in column) but since is a red tile and then a blue tile i will need to move 2 position in column to be able to use a blue chip.\n\nhowever if i move 2 position to right i will be able to use 1 blue chip, since this 2 movements are toward my goal and one of them put me on the same column as my goal i will use that

only valid move toward my goal is not available because i don't have the required resource.\n\nthe only other adjacent move would be to move to a tile that i have the required resource for. the tile

isn't an option since it would take me away from the goal, and there's no tile to the left. \n\nhowever, there is an option that i can consider: moving right-down isn't possible because of the missing red chip, moving left isn't possible since there's no tile, moving up isn't possible because i'm already at row 0. moving down puts me on a red tile (no resources), moving right puts me on a red tile (no resources). the next move in my best path requires a red chip, but another valid move that is still toward my goal that doesn't require a red chip isn't possible. however i still can move toward

don't have the resource for), moving down would put me on a red tile (which i don't have the resource for), but moving left isn't an option since it would take me away from the goal, and there's no tile to the left. \n\nhowever, there is an option that i can consider: moving right-down isn't possible because of the missing red chip, moving left isn't possible since there's no tile, moving up isn't possible because i'm already at row 0. moving down puts me on a red tile (no resources), moving right puts me on a red tile (no resources). the next move in my best path requires a red chip, but

toward my goal using this tile isn't possible, moving left isn't an option, the other options requires red chip that i don't have.\n\nhowever another option could be to move to a tile where i have the required resource, this move is toward (0, no movement in row, and movement in column) but since is a red tile and then a blue tile i will need to move 2 position in column to be able to use a blue

move\nYou said: based on the board layout and my current position at (0, 0), my goal is at (3, 3). i have resources {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. \n\nmy estimated best path options to my goal show that i don't have the required resources for the shortest path (i'm missing 2 red chips).\n\nhowever, my next move can be to (1, 0), which requires a red chip that i don't have, so i can't make that move. \n\nanother option is to move to (0, 1), which is a red tile. i don't have a red chip, so i also can't make that move.\n\nmy only valid move toward my goal is not available because i don't have the required resource.\n\nthe only other adjacent move would be to move to a tile that i have the required resource for. the tile at (0, 0) is green, so moving right would put me on a red tile (which i don't have the resource for), moving down would put me on a red tile (which i don't have the resource for), but moving left isn't an option since it would take me away from the goal, and there's no tile to the left. \n\nhowever, there is an option that i can consider: moving right-down isn't possible because of the missing red chip, moving left isn't possible since there's no tile, moving up isn't possible because i'm already at row 0. moving down puts me on a red tile (no resources), moving right puts me on a red tile (no resources). the next move in my best path requires a red chip, but another valid move that is still toward my goal that doesn't require a red chip isn't possible. however i still can move toward my goal but using another path.\n\nin the regular path (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3), the move from (0,0) to (1,0) is no possible to me, however a move to (0,1) isn't possible either because is a red tile and i don't have the required chip.\n\nanother option that i have is to move to a position where the tile isn't red, i have a green chip and i am at position (0,0) and the tile is green so i don't need to pay, however a valid move toward my goal using this tile isn't possible, moving left isn't an option, the other options requires red chip that i don't have.\n\nhowever another option could be to move to a tile where i have the required resource, this move is toward (0, no movement in row, and movement in column) but since is a red tile and then a blue tile i will need to move 2 position in column to be able to use a blue chip.\n\nsince my last answer was to move \"0,2\" but for some reason the game didn't move me to the position (0, 2) i will make the same move to (0, 2) \n\nin this turn i will move \"0,2\" that will put me on a blue tile using one blue chip.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2

will move \"0,2\" that will put me on a blue tile using one blue chip.\n\nbut since that move didn't make me move i will try to move in a different direction to see if i can make a valid move. in that sense i will move to the right to put me on a red tile this move isn't possible but i want to make sure that the game recognize the movement, then after make this move and see if is valid i want to try to move again to the right so i end on a blue tile that is my main goal.\n\nin this turn i will move \"0,1\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n-

board layout and my current position at (0, 0), my goal is at (3, 3). i have resources {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. \n\nmy estimated best path options to my goal show that i don't have the required resources for the shortest path (i'm missing 2 red chips).\n\nhowever, my next move can be to (1, 0), which requires a red chip that i don't have, so i can't make that move. \n\nanother option is to move to (0, 1), which is a red tile. i don't have a red chip, so i also can't make that move.\n\nmy only valid move toward my goal is not available because i don't have the required resource.\n\nthe only other adjacent move would be to move to a tile that i have the required resource for. the tile at (0, 0) is green, so moving right would put me on a red tile (which i don't have the resource for), moving down would put me on a red tile (which i don't have the resource for), but moving left isn't an option since it would take me away from the goal, and there's no tile to the left. \n\nhowever, there is an option that i can consider: moving right-down isn't possible because of the missing red chip, moving left isn't possible since there's no tile, moving up isn't possible because i'm already at row 0. moving down puts me on a red tile (no resources), moving right puts me on a red tile (no resources). the next move in my best path requires a red chip, but another valid move that is still toward my goal that doesn't require a red chip isn't possible. however i still can move toward my goal but using another path.\n\nin the regular path (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3), the move from (0,0) to (1,0) is no possible to me, however a move to (0,1) isn't possible either because is a red tile and i don't have the required chip.\n\nanother option that i have is to move to a position where the tile isn't red, i have a green chip and i am at position (0,0) and the tile is green so i don't need to pay, however a valid move toward my goal using this tile isn't possible, moving left isn't an option, the other options requires red chip that i don't have.\n\nhowever another option could be to move to a tile where i have the required resource, this move is toward (0, no movement in row, and movement in column) but since is a red tile and then a blue tile i will need to move 2 position in column to be able to use a blue chip.\n\nsince my last answer was to move \"0,2\" but for some reason the game didn't move me to the position (0, 2) i will make the same move to (0, 2) \n\nin this turn i will move \"0,2\" that will put me on a blue tile using one blue chip.\n\nbut since that move didn't make me move i will try to move in a different direction to see if i can make a valid move. in that sense i will move to the right to put me on a red tile this move isn't possible but i want to make sure that the game recognize the movement, then after make this move and see if is valid i want to try to move again to the right so i end on a blue tile that is my main goal.\n\nin this turn i will move \"0,1\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources:

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
