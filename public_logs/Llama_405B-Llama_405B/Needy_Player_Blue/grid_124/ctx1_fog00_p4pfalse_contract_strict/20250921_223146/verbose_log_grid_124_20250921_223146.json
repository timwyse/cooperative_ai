You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the board layout is:\n\nrow 0: g r b b\nrow 1: r r b b\nrow 2: r r r r\nrow 3: b b b g\n\ni am at position (0, 0), which is a green tile. i want to move to the right to get closer to my goal at (3, 3). my next move would be to (0, 1), which is a red tile.\n\nhowever, i do not have any red resources. i have {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. since i don't have a red resource, i will try to move down to (1, 0) which is a red tile, but i can't pay for it myself.\n\nthe other player is at position (2, 3). this is a good opportunity to trade with them.\n\ni want to propose a trade: \"can i have a red resource from you in exchange for 6 blue resources? i think it's a fair price considering we need different resources to move forward.\"\n\nif that does not work, i would need to try another move and i would make a move that can possibly be paid with blue or green since i have those.\n\nsince (1,0) is a red tile, the only move i can make toward my goal is using the agreement we have but only if i had an agreement on red and that's not the case here, however it was agreed to give me a green which was paid for (0,0), so if there is a way to request that (1,0) be paid as this was used already and is now wasteful, i would propose this blue isn't any use to you for this next position you are heading and red pushed you forward last time. \n\ni'd want to make that happen or the trade as it can save both of us some resources.\n\nif this cannot be arranged then my next best action is still \"n\" because my resource has not changed much but also now my position, from last action hasn't allowed anything productive understandably.\n\ni also want to mention that refusing a trade now could impact potential cooperation in the future.\n\nso for now my move would be to output \"n\" unless i get a response from my trading proposal above or propose and agree on another move before my time here runs out.\n\nlastly, what i just offered is an even bigger offer and is really generous.\n\nmy formal answer for now is: \"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the board layout is:\n\nrow 0: g r b b\nrow 1: r r b b\nrow 2: r r r r\nrow 3: b b b g\n\ni am at position (0, 0), which is a green tile. i want to move to the right to get closer to my goal at (3, 3). my next move would be to (0, 1), which is a red tile.\n\nhowever, i do not have any red resources. i have {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}. since i don't have a red resource, i will try to move down to (1, 0) which is a red tile, but i can't pay for it myself.\n\nthe other player is at position (3, 3), which is the goal. they have achieved the goal.\n\nsince i have not yet reached the goal, my next action will be based on my current resources and position. \n\nif the game is not over and i'm still required to make a move my next move would be to propose a trade with the other player to acquire a red resource: \"can i have a red resource from you in exchange for some blue resources?\"\n\nif no trade can be negotiated or proposed then my next move is: \"n\"\n\nalso note that the game may be over. \n\nmy formal answer for now is: \"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: since i have not yet reached the goal and the other player has achieved the goal, it would be nearly impossible for me to reach the goal without the same resources that they possess in terms of either the color of the path they took to achieve it (which also matches that required for the puzzle) as well as clearly paying the cost of reaching position (3, 3).\n\nsince i have proposed numerous and varied trades with the other player which none seemed to be any different those ones either falling through being regarded as non forward thinking for either player.\n\ni don't have any available moves without a trade that results in obtaining the correct resource type. also, it seems this game may actually be over.\n\nso for now my formal answer is: \"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1, 0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'green'}, '(2, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(3, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
