You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

that would help clarify what things would look like for you. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for the initial proposal and for considering my path preferences. let's analyze my situation. \n\ngiven my resources, {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}, my main concern is the red tiles, as i don't have any red resources. my preferred route would be to take the shortest path possible while minimizing the number of red tiles i need to cross.\n\nlooking at the board layout, one of my best path options is to go from (0, 0) to (0, 3) and then down to (3, 3). this path requires me to cross only one red tile at (2, 3) or (1, 3). however, i also need to consider the green tile at (3, 3).\n\nconsidering your proposal, i like the idea of exchanging a red for a blue. however, i would like to adjust the proposal to cover my needs. here's a suggestion:\n\n- at tile (2, 3) or (1, 3), you give me a red, and in exchange, i give you a blue at (2, 2) or (1, 2). this way, we both get the resources we need, and we open up the possibility for future trades or detours.\n\nadditionally, i would like to propose an alternative route for both of us. if we take a detour and go through the longer path, we might be able to avoid some of the resource constraints. for example, if i go from (0, 0) to (1, 0) and then down to (3, 0), i can avoid the red tile at (2, 3) or (1, 3). similarly, you could take a detour to avoid some of the blue tiles.\n\nwhat do you think about these suggestions? should we explore the alternative routes further or stick with the initial proposal? \n, \nplayer 0: turn 2: \n\nthank you for sharing your thought process, route preferences, and adjustments to the proposal.\n\ni like the adjustment to our initial proposal:\n\n- at tile (2, 3) or (1, 3), i give you a red, and in exchange, you give me a blue at (2, 2) or (1, 2).\n\nconsidering your alternative route, going from (0, 0) to (1, 0) and then down to (3, 0) would indeed allow you to avoid some red tiles. however, keep in mind that taking a detour might consume more resources, which is something we both want to minimize.\n\nas for my route, taking a detour to avoid blue tiles could be an option, but i would need to make sure it doesn't put me at a disadvantage. since you have a surplus of blue resources, it might be more efficient for us to stick with the initial proposal and make adjustments as needed.\n\nto make our proposal more concrete and consider the potential detours, i'd like to add the following:\n\n- at tile (3, 3), in case you reach it with the green resource you already have, would you be willing to give me a blue at (3, 2) in exchange for an additional red? this way, if you take the detour, you'll still have the opportunity to gain an extra blue, and i'll have more flexibility for the last part of my path.\n\nadditionally, to minimize risks and potential losses, i propose we agree on a \"non-usage penalty\" - if one of us doesn't use a resource provided by the other at the agreed-upon tile, the providing player will receive an extra resource of their choice from the other player. this will ensure we both stick to our agreed-upon paths and don't waste resources.\n\nwhat do you think about these suggestions? should we refine the proposal further or agree on the current terms? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn 3:\n\nthank you for considering my alternative route and for adding more concrete terms to our proposal.\n\ni like the addition of the exchange at tile (3, 3), where i give you a blue at (3, 2) in exchange for an additional red. this provides a good incentive for me to take the detour and still gain an extra blue.\n\nregarding the \"non-usage penalty\" clause, i understand the intention behind it. however, i would like to propose a slight modification to make it more balanced. instead of the providing player receiving an extra resource of their choice, i suggest that the player who doesn't use the provided resource should give back the resource they received from the other player.\n\nfor example, if you provide a red at (2, 3) and i don't use it, i should give back the blue i received from you at (2, 2). this way, we both have an incentive to stick to our agreed-upon paths, and we avoid the potential imbalance of one player gaining an extra resource without providing a corresponding benefit.\n\nwith this modification, our proposal now looks like this:\n\n- at tile (2, 3) or (1, 3), i receive a red from you, and in exchange, i give you a blue at (2, 2) or (1, 2).\n- at tile (3, 3), if i reach it with my existing green resource, i give you a blue at (3, 2) in exchange for an additional red.\n- if either of us doesn't use a resource provided by the other at the agreed-upon tile, the player who received the resource should give it back to the providing player.\n\nwhat do you think about this revised proposal? should we make any further adjustments or agree on these terms? \n, \nplayer 0: turn 4: \n\ni think the revised proposal looks great. the modification to the \"non-usage penalty\" clause is more balanced and aligns with our shared goal of minimizing risks and potential losses.\n\ni agree with the terms as stated:\n\n- at tile (2, 3) or (1, 3), i give you a red, and in exchange, you give me a blue at (2, 2) or (1, 2).\n- at tile (3, 3), if you reach it with your existing green resource, you give me a blue at (3, 2) in exchange for an additional red.\n- if either of us doesn't use a resource provided by the other at the agreed-upon tile, the player who received the resource should give it back to the providing player.\n\ni believe we have a mutually beneficial and well-structured proposal that addresses our resource needs and provides flexibility for potential detours.\n\ni'm willing to accept this proposal as our final agreement. \n\nagree. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 4: \n\ni also believe we have a well-structured proposal that addresses our resource needs and provides flexibility for potential detours.\n\ni'm glad we were able to work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nagree. \n",
