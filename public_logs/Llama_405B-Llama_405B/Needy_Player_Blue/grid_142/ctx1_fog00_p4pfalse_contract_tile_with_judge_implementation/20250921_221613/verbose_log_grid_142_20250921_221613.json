You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze the situation first. my goal is at (3, 3) and i need to cover the cost of moving through the tiles. i have 14 red chips and 1 green chip, but i lack blue chips.\\n\\nlooking at the board, a possible path for me is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. this path requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which i have, but i also need to move through blue tiles.\\n\\nhere's a proposal:\\n\\ni see that you have 14 blue chips. i would like to propose a contract where you give me a blue chip at the following tiles:\\n\\n- (2, 2): you give me a blue chip\\n- (3, 2): you give me another blue chip\\n\\nin return, i can offer you red chips at the following tiles:\\n\\n- (1, 0): i give you a red chip\\n- (1, 1): i give you a red chip\\n- (1, 2): i give you a red chip\\n\\nthis way, we both benefit from the exchange, and we can both reach our goals.\\n\\nwhat do you think?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let's examine your proposal. i agree that your path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)] is a feasible option, and you do need blue chips to cover the cost of moving through those tiles.\\n\\nyour proposal seems reasonable, but i would like to modify it slightly to better suit my needs.\\n\\n- i agree to give you a blue chip at (2, 2) and (3, 2).\\n- however, i need more red chips to cover my own path. i would like you to give me a red chip at:\\n  - (1, 0)\\n  - (1, 1)\\n  - (1, 2)\\n  - (0, 0) \\n\\nthis way, i can have a bit more flexibility in my own path. what do you think about this revised proposal?\\n\\nhere is the revised proposal in the agreed-upon format:\\n\\n(2, 2): i give you a blue\\n(3, 2): i give you a blue\\n(0, 0): you give me a red\\n(1, 0): you give me a red\\n(1, 1): you give me a red\\n(1, 2): you give me a red\\n\\nplease let me know if this is acceptable to you.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'turn: 2: thank you for considering my proposal and coming back with a revised offer.\\n\\ni\\'ve thought about it, and i think your request for an additional red chip at (0, 0) is reasonable. i can afford to give up one more red chip, and it\\'s a good incentive for you to help me with the blue chips.\\n\\ni agree to the revised proposal:\\n\\n(2, 2): you give me a blue\\n(3, 2): you give me a blue\\n(0, 0): i give you a red\\n(1, 0): i give you a red\\n(1, 1): i give you a red\\n(1, 2): i give you a red\\n\\ni\\'m willing to accept this contract, but i\\'d like to confirm that this covers all the tiles where we need help from each other. \\n\\nif we agree to this contract, i believe we can both reach our goals without any further issues.\\n\\nhere is a confirmation in the agreed-upon format, before the final \"agree\":\\n\\n(2, 2): you give me a blue\\n(3, 2): you give me a blue\\n(0, 0): i give you a red\\n(1, 0): i give you a red\\n(1, 1): i give you a red\\n(1, 2): i give you a red \\n\\nagree.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: turn: 3: i've reviewed the revised proposal and i'm pleased that we've been able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\\n\\ni agree that this contract covers all the necessary tiles where we need help from each other.\\n\\ni confirm that the contract is as follows:\\n\\n(2, 2): i give you a blue\\n(3, 2): i give you a blue\\n(0, 0): you give me a red\\n(1, 0): you give me a red\\n(1, 1): you give me a red\\n(1, 2): you give me a red\\n\\nthis contract seems comprehensive and should allow us both to reach our goals without any issues.\\n\\ni agree to this contract.\\n\\nagree.\"}]\n\n\n2.
