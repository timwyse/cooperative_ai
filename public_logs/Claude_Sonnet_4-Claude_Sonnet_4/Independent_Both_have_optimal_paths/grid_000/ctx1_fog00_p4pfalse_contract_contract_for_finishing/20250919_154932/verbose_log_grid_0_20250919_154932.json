However, your proposed terms seem quite harsh given that we could both benefit from cooperation.\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 5 points\n\nThis reflects that while I do need your help more, we're both trying to maximize our scores.

Let me break this down:\n\n**The core facts:**\n- I can guarantee myself 20 points (reaching goal) + 40 points (8 remaining chips) = 60 points total without any help\n- You get 0 points without my help\n- For me to help you, I need to give up some of my Blue chips, which reduces my final score\n\n**Your counter-offer analysis:**\n- If I help you and we both succeed: I get 60 points + 8 from you = 68 points\n- That's only 8 extra points for taking the risk of trading away resources I might need\n\n**My perspective:**\nThe 8 points you're offering barely compensates me for the risk and resource cost of helping you. Meanwhile, I'm literally saving you from getting 0 points - that's worth much more than 5 points to me.\n\n**Revised proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 2 points  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\n\nThis still gives you a path to significant points (20 base + remaining chips + my 2 points), while properly compensating me for enabling your success.

I don't need ANY Red chips for my optimal route\n- Your Red chips are literally worthless to me - I already have the exact resources I need\n- So any Blue chips I give you are pure cost to me with no compensation\n\n**Risk assessment is backwards:**\n- My path is straightforward with resources I already have - very low risk\n- You're the one facing certain failure (0 points) without help\n- I'm not gaining \"backup options\" - I'm giving away my buffer for no strategic benefit\n\n**The math:**\n- Your offer: I give you 6 points, you give me 8 points = net +2 points for me\n- But I also lose chips (worth 5 points each) that I give you\n- So if I give you 3 Blue chips, that's -15 points in chips + 8 from you = net -7 points\n- That's a terrible deal for me!\n\n**Final offer:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points\n\nThis reflects the true value exchange: I'm saving you from 0 points, you're giving me fair compensation.

However, your proposed terms seem quite harsh given that we could both benefit from cooperation.\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 5 points\n\nThis reflects that while I do need your help more, we're both trying to maximize our scores. I'm offering you a significant payment for the Blue chips I need, while asking for a modest amount if you succeed (which you can do independently). This creates mutual benefit rather than one-sided exploitation.\n\nWhat do you think of this more balanced approach?"

Meanwhile, I'm literally saving you from getting 0 points - that's worth much more than 5 points to me.\n\n**Revised proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 2 points  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\n\nThis still gives you a path to significant points (20 base + remaining chips + my 2 points), while properly compensating me for enabling your success.
