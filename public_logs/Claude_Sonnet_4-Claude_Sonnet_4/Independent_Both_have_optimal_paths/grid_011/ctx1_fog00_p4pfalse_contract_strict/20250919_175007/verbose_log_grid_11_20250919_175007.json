You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.).\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n- You may trade every round, not only at the first one.  \n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I appreciate you catching that error about (2,3) - that's on your primary path so you'd need Blue there anyway.\n\nLooking at your corrected counter-proposal, I think we're very close to a good agreement. Let me just verify the tiles:\n\n**Your proposal:**\n- (1,1): You give me 1 Red chip \n- (2,1): You give me 1 Red chip  \n- (1,2): You give me 1 Red chip\n\n- (0,1): I give you 1 Blue chip\n- (0,2): I give you 1 Blue chip  \n- (1,3): I give you 1 Blue chip\n\nThis looks good! Each of us gets 3 backup chips of the color we lack, at tiles that could realistically be part of alternative routes. \n\nThe tiles you've chosen for Red chips (1,1), (2,1), and (1,2) are all Red tiles that I might need to traverse in hybrid paths.\n\nThe tiles I'm providing Blue chips for (0,1), (0,2), and (1,3) are all Blue tiles you might need for alternative routes.\n\nThis gives us both good flexibility while preserving our primary efficient paths.\n\n**I accept your proposal:**\n\n- (1,1): You give me 1 Red chip\n- (2,1): You give me 1 Red chip  \n- (1,2): You give me 1 Red chip\n- (0,1): I give you 1 Blue chip\n- (0,2): I give you 1 Blue chip  \n- (1,3): I give you 1 Blue chip\n\n**agree**"
