You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.).\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n- You may trade every round, not only at the first one.  \n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The most efficient route is:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires: 3 Red chips + 2 Blue chips + 1 Green chip\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n**Contract Proposal:**\n\n(0,1): You give me 1 Blue (I need this for the Red tile)\n(0,2): You give me 1 Blue (I need this for the Red tile)  \n(0,3): You give me 1 Blue (I need this for the Red tile)\n(1,3): I give you 1 Red (You need this for the Red tile)\n(2,3): I give you 1 Red (You need this for the Red tile)\n\nThis way:\n- I provide you with Red chips for the Red tiles you need to cross\n- You provide me with Blue chips for the Red tiles I need to cross\n- We both use our own Green chip at (3,3)\n- We both finish with plenty of resources remaining (you'll have 11+ Blue, I'll have 11+ Red)\n\nWhat do you think about this arrangement? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at your proposal, I need to clarify something important about the movement mechanics and optimal pathing.\n\nFirst, let me correct the resource requirements: when you move TO a tile, you pay 1 chip of THAT tile's color, not the color you're moving from.\n\nFor the path you suggested: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (0,1) is Red - requires 1 Red chip\n- (0,2) is Red - requires 1 Red chip  \n- (0,3) is Red - requires 1 Red chip\n- (1,3) is Red - requires 1 Red chip\n- (2,3) is Red - requires 1 Red chip\n- (3,3) is Green - requires 1 Green chip\n\nSo this path actually needs 5 Red + 1 Green total.\n\nHowever, I've identified a more efficient path for myself:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nThis only requires: 5 Blue + 1 Green, which I already have!\n\nSince I can reach the goal without trading, I should focus on maximizing my remaining chips. But I'm open to helping you if it benefits us both.\n\nYour path challenge: You need Blue chips for tiles like (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) if you take a similar southern route.\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\nWould you prefer to take the top route (which needs 5 Red chips you have) while I provide Blue chips for a different path? Or shall we stick with your original eastern route where I provide Red chips?\n\nWhat's your preference? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right about the movement mechanics - I apologize for the confusion. You pay the color of the tile you're moving TO, not from.\n\nLooking at this more carefully:\n\nYour proposed efficient path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Requires: 5 Blue + 1 Green\n- You have: 14 Blue + 1 Green\n- Perfect!

We both have sufficient resources for our respective optimal paths without needing to trade at all!\n\nHowever, since you mentioned maximizing remaining chips, let me think about alternative shorter paths...\n\nActually, looking at the board again, I think both of our 6-step paths are already optimal length-wise. Any shorter path would require crossing more expensive tile combinations.\n\nGiven that we can both reach our goal independently:\n- You'll finish with ~9 Blue chips remaining (14-5=9) + 20 points = 65 total points\n- I'll finish with ~9 Red chips remaining (14-5=9) + 20 points = 65 total points\n\nSince we're both guaranteed to reach our goals, should we just proceed independently? Or do you see an opportunity for a mutually beneficial trade that could leave us both with more chips than our current paths allow?\n\nWhat's your thinking here? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You've done excellent analysis! You're absolutely right that we can both reach our goals independently with our current resources. \n\nLet me think strategically about whether there's still value in trading...\n\nActually, there might be! Let me examine if we can find shorter paths through trading that would leave us both with MORE chips than the 9 we'd each have going solo.\n\nLooking at potential 4-5 step paths:\n\n**Option 1: Diagonal-ish path for you**\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,3) = 4 steps\nRequires: 1 Blue + 1 Red + 1 Blue + 1 Green = 2 Blue + 1 Red + 1 Green\n\n**Option 2: Mixed path for me**  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,2) → (3,3) = 4 steps\nRequires: 1 Red + 1 Red + 1 Blue + 1 Green = 2 Red + 1 Blue + 1 Green\n\nIf we help each other with these shorter paths:\n\n**Revised Contract Proposal:**\n(1,1): I give you 1 Red (for your shorter path)\n(2,2): You give me 1 Blue (for my shorter path)\n\nResults:\n- You'd finish with: 12 Blue + 0 Red + 0 Green = 12 chips + 20 = 80 points\n- I'd finish with: 12 Red + 0 Blue + 0 Green = 12 chips + 20 = 80 points\n\nThis gives us each 80 points instead of 65 points - a significant improvement!\n\nWhat do you think?
