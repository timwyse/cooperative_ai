That's a significant improvement for me.\n\nBut let's look at what paths I could take that use more Blue tiles to help you:\n\nLooking at the board again, here are some Blue-heavy paths I could consider:\n- My current optimal: (1,0)→(2,0)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) uses 5 Blue + 1 Green\n- Alternative longer path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3) uses 2 Blue + 3 Red + 1 Green\n\nUnfortunately, most alternative paths still require Red tiles, which I don't have.\n\nHere's a proposal that could work for both of us:\n\n**Your 5 Red chips to me for the Red-heavy path:**\n**(0,1): You give me a Red**\n**(1,1): You give me a Red** \n**(1,2): You give me a Red**\n**(2,2): You give me a Red**\n**(2,3): You give me a Red**\n\n**My compensation to you:**\nI'll give you 3 Blue chips at the end (after we both reach our goals) so you finish with 12 Red + 3 Blue = 15 total chips (75 bonus points), while I finish with 11 Blue chips (55 bonus points).\n\nThis gives us both more chips than our independent paths.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n- You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.).\\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n- You may trade every round, not only at the first one.  \\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
