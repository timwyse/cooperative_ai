The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But when I move to (3,1), I need to pay the cost myself.\n\nSince I have plenty of Blue resources (14) and (3, 1) is the next step in my optimal path to the goal, this is the clear choice.\n\n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (3, 1)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nMy best path is: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] - requires B:1, G:1 (which I have!)\n\nFrom my current position (3, 1), I can move to adjacent tiles:\n- (2, 1) - Red tile (I have 0 Red, and this moves away from goal)\n- (3, 0) - Blue tile (I have 13 Blue, but this moves away from goal)\n- (3, 2) - Blue tile (I have 13 Blue, and this is toward my goal!)\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nSo (3, 2) is a Blue tile, and I have 13 Blue resources. According to the contract, for (3,2), I'm the giver and the other player is the receiver, which means when the other player moves to (3,2), I would pay for them. But when I move to (3,2), I need to pay the cost myself.\n\nSince I have plenty of Blue resources (13) and (3, 2) is the next step in my optimal path to the goal, this is the clear choice.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
