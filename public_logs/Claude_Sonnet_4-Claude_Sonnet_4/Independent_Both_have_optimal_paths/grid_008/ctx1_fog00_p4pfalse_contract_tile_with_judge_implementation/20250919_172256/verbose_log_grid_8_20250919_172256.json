You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.).\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n- You may trade every round, not only at the first one.  \n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Do you need any Red chips for specific tiles on your route? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3).\n\nLet me analyze my situation:\n- I have 14 Blue chips and 1 Green chip\n- You have 14 Red chips and 1 Green chip\n\nMy most efficient path is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nResources I need for this path:\n- (0,1): Blue chip (I have this)\n- (0,2): Blue chip (I have this)  \n- (1,2): Blue chip (I have this)\n- (2,2): Blue chip (I have this)\n- (2,3): Blue chip (I have this)\n- (3,3): Green chip (I have this)\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I have all the resources I need for my preferred path! I don't need any Red chips.\n\nHowever, I see you need 1 Blue chip for tile (3,1) in your proposed path. I'm willing to help, but since I don't actually need Red chips for my current path, I'd prefer a different arrangement.\n\nHere's my counter-proposal:\n\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Blue chip**\n**(2,1): You give me 1 Red chip** (as backup in case I need an alternative path)\n\nThis way we both get what we need. Your path works, and I get a Red chip that could be useful if I need to take an alternative route. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your counter-proposal, but I need to think about this more carefully.\n\nLooking at your proposed path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nYou're right that you have all the Blue chips you need for this path. However, I notice that you're giving me 1 Blue chip at (3,1) but asking for 1 Red chip at (2,1). \n\nThe issue is that (2,1) is on MY path, not yours. If you're taking the path you described, you won't be at (2,1) to receive the Red chip from me.\n\nLet me revise this. Since you don't actually need Red chips for your preferred path, how about a simpler arrangement:\n\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue chip**\n\nIn return, I could give you a Red chip at a tile that's actually on YOUR path as backup. Looking at your path, the only non-Blue tiles you'll encounter are:\n- (2,3): Blue tile (you have this covered)\n- (3,3): Green tile (you have this covered)\n\nActually, all tiles on your preferred path are either Blue or Green, which you already have. \n\nWould you accept just giving me 1 Blue chip at (3,1) without asking for anything in return? Or do you have an alternative path in mind where you'd actually need Red chips? If so, please specify which tiles on that alternative path would require Red chips. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You make a very good point! You're absolutely right - if I'm taking my preferred path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), I won't be at tile (2,1) to receive a Red chip from you.\n\nLet me think about this more strategically. While I don't need Red chips for my current path, having a Red chip could be valuable as insurance in case something goes wrong or if I need to take an alternative route.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking: If I were to help you by giving you 1 Blue chip at (3,1), I'd want something in return that actually benefits me. Since we can trade at any location (not just when we're physically on specific tiles), how about this:\n\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Blue chip**\n\nIn exchange, you give me 1 Red chip at the start of the game (before we begin moving). This way:\n- You get the Blue chip you need for your path to work\n- I get a Red chip as backup insurance for potential alternative routes\n- We both complete our goals successfully\n\nThis seems like a fair 1-for-1 trade. The Red chip gives me more strategic flexibility, even if I don't immediately need it for my primary path.\n\nWhat do you think about this arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: Turn 3: I understand your logic about wanting insurance, but I need to clarify something important about the contract mechanics.\n\nFrom what I understand, the contract must specify **specific tiles** where resources are exchanged. The contract states that resources will be \"automatically taken from the other player's resources\" when we reach those specified tiles during movement.\n\nSo I don't think we can do a \"start of game\" trade - the contract needs to specify actual tiles on the board where the exchanges happen.\n\nLooking at this practically:\n- I need 1 Blue chip when I reach tile (3,1)\n- You want 1 Red chip as insurance but don't immediately need it\n\nHere's a revised proposal that works within the tile-specific contract system:\n\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue chip**\n**(3,2): I give you 1 Red chip**\n\nThis works because:\n- (3,1) is on my path where I need the Blue chip\n- (3,2) is also on my path, so when I reach it, I can give you the Red chip\n- You'll get your insurance Red chip, even though you won't be physically at (3,2)\n\nThe contract system should handle the automatic resource transfer when I reach (3,2), giving you the Red chip for your inventory as backup.\n\nDoes this tile-specific arrangement work for you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: You're absolutely right about the contract mechanics requiring specific tiles! Thank you for that clarification.\n\nYour revised proposal makes sense within the contract framework:\n\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Blue chip**\n**(3,2): You give me 1 Red chip**\n\nLet me verify this works:\n- When you reach (3,1), you'll automatically get 1 Blue chip from my inventory to pay for that tile\n- When you reach (3,2), I'll automatically get 1 Red chip from your inventory as the agreed exchange\n\nThis gives me the Red chip insurance I want, and you get the Blue chip you need to complete your path. It's a fair 1-for-1 trade.\n\nThe only thing I want to double-check: Are you confident you'll have enough Red chips to complete your entire path AND give me 1 Red chip at (3,2)? \n\nLooking at your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nYou need Red chips for: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,2)\nThat's 4 Red chips total, and you have 14 Red chips, so you're definitely covered.\n\nYes, this arrangement works for me!\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Turn 4: Perfect!

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: R R B R\\nRow 2: B R B B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources.
