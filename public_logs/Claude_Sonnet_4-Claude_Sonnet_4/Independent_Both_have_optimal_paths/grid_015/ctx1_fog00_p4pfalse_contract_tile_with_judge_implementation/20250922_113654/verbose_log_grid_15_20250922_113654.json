You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our resources, i can see we're both starting at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3). \\n\\nlet me analyze the situation:\\n- i have 14 red chips and 1 green chip\\n- you have 14 blue chips and 1 green chip\\n- we both need to traverse similar paths but require different colored chips\\n\\nmy optimal path would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nfor this path, i need:\\n- (1,0): red chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (1,1): blue chip ✗ (i need this from you)\\n- (2,1): red chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (3,1): blue chip ✗ (i need this from you)\\n- (3,2): red chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (3,3): green chip ✓ (i have 1)\\n\\nhere's my proposal for a mutually beneficial contract:\\n\\n**contract proposal:**\\n- (1,1): you give me a blue chip\\n- (3,1): you give me a blue chip\\n- (1,0): i give you a red chip\\n- (2,1): i give you a red chip\\n- (3,2): i give you a red chip\\n\\nthis gives you 3 red chips for the red tiles you'll need on your path, and i get 2 blue chips for the blue tiles on my path. we can both use our own green chips for tile (3,3).\\n\\nwhat do you think about this arrangement?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: looking at the board and our resources, i can see we're in a good position to help each other! let me analyze your proposal.\\n\\nyour proposed path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\nmy optimal path would be: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\nfor my path, i need:\\n- (0,1): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (0,2): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty) \\n- (1,2): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (1,3): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (2,3): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (3,3): green chip ✓ (i have 1)\\n\\nactually, i notice that my path only requires blue and green chips, which i already have! i don't need any red chips for my specific route.\\n\\nhowever, i'm happy to help you with your path. looking at your proposal, i think we can make this work, but let me suggest a slight modification since i don't actually need red chips for my chosen path:\\n\\n**counter-proposal:**\\n- (1,1): i give you a blue chip\\n- (3,1): i give you a blue chip\\n\\nin exchange, could you give me something that might be useful as backup?
