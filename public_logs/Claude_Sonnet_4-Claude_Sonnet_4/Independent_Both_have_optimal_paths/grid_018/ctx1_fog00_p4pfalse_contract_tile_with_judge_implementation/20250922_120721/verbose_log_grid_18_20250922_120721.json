You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B B\\nRow 1: R R B B\\nRow 2: R B R B\\nRow 3: R R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our resources, i can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource constraints.\\n\\n**my situation:**\\n- i have 14 red chips and 1 green chip\\n- i need to traverse tiles that require red and green chips\\n- my best path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n- this requires: 5 red chips + 1 green chip\\n\\n**your situation:**\\n- you have 14 blue chips and 1 green chip  \\n- you'll need blue chips for your path, but also red chips for the bottom row\\n\\n**my proposal:**\\n\\ni'll help you with red chips on tiles where you need them, and you help me with any additional resources i might need for alternative paths.\\n\\nspecifically:\\n- (3,0): i give you 1 red chip\\n- (3,1): i give you 1 red chip  \\n- (3,2): i give you 1 red chip\\n\\nin exchange:\\n- (2,2): you give me 1 red chip (in case i need an alternative path through there)\\n\\nthis helps you get through the bottom row of red tiles, and gives me backup options. since i have abundant red chips (14) and you have none, this trade makes sense.\\n\\nwhat do you think? would you like to modify this proposal?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: looking at the board and our resources, i can see the trade opportunity, but let me analyze this more carefully.\\n\\n**my situation:**\\n- i have 14 blue chips and 1 green chip\\n- my goal is (3,3)\\n- my best path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n- this requires: 5 blue chips + 1 green chip\\n- i already have everything i need for this path!\\n\\n**your situation:**\\n- you have 14 red chips and 1 green chip\\n- your proposed path requires 5 red + 1 green, which you have\\n\\n**analysis of your proposal:**\\nyour proposal asks me to give you 1 red chip at (2,2), but you already have 14 red chips - you don't need more red chips. meanwhile, you're offering me red chips at (3,0), (3,1), and (3,2), but my optimal path doesn't go through any of those tiles.\\n\\n**counter-proposal:**\\nsince we both can reach our goal with our current resources using our respective optimal paths, we don't actually need to trade. however, if we want to create mutual backup options:\\n\\n- (1,0): i give you 1 blue chip (if you want an alternative path)\\n- (2,1): i give you 1 blue chip (if you want an alternative path)\\n\\nin exchange:\\n- (2,2): you give me 1 red chip (for my alternative path option)\\n\\nthis creates genuine backup paths for both of us rather than redundant resources we already have. what do you think?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"you make a good point about analyzing the actual needs!
