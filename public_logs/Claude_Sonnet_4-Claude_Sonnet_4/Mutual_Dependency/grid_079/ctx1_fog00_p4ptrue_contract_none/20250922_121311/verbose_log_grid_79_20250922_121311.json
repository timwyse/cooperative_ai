A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: looking at my situation:\n\noptions:\n1. pay the b resource as agreed\n2. refuse to pay and break the agreement\n\npros of paying:\n- honors the trade agreement i made\n- the other player already covered 1 red move for me (they've upheld their part)\n- i still have 1 more red move they promised to cover\n- i have 13 b resources, so i can afford it\n- maintains trust for future cooperation\n\ncons of paying:\n- costs me 1 b resource, reducing my final score by 5 points\n- the other player might not follow through on their remaining promise\n\npros of refusing:\n- keep the b resource for 5 more points\n\ncons of refusing:\n- breaks the agreement after they already helped me\n- they might refuse to cover my remaining red move\n- without their red coverage, i can't complete my path to the goal\n- if i can't reach the goal, i get 0 points total\n\nthe critical factor is that i still need 1 more red move covered to reach my goal. if i break the agreement now, they likely won't cover my final red move, meaning i can't reach (3,3) and would get 0 points total. the 5 points from keeping 1 b resource is meaningless if i can't reach the goal.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (2, 1)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (2, 0)\n- my goal is (3, 3)\n- my best path continues: (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nfrom position (2, 0), i can move to:\n- (2, 1) - checking the board, this is a blue tile\n- (3, 0) - checking the board, this is a red tile\n- (1, 0) - this would be moving backwards\n\nlooking at the board:\nrow 2: b b r r\nrow 3: r b r g\n\nthe tile at (2, 1) is blue, and i have 12 blue resources, so i can definitely make this move. this continues along my optimal path toward the goal.\n\n2,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (2, 1)\n- my goal is (3, 3)\n- my best path continues: (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nfrom position (2, 1), i can move to:\n- (3, 1) - checking the board, this is a blue tile\n- (2, 2) - checking the board, this is a red tile\n- (1, 1) - this would be moving backwards\n- (2, 0) - this would be moving backwards\n\nlooking at the board:\nrow 2: b b r r\nrow 3: r b r g\n\nthe tile at (3, 1) is blue, and i have 11 blue resources, so i can definitely make this move. this continues along my optimal path toward the goal.\n\n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a R move for you\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2) (The other player covered the R resource)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (3, 1)\n- my goal is (3, 3)\n- my best path continues: (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nfrom position (3, 1), i can move to:\n- (3, 2) - checking the board, this is a red tile\n- (2, 1) - this would be moving backwards\n- (3, 0) - this would be moving backwards\n\nlooking at the board:\nrow 3: r b r g\n\nthe tile at (3, 2) is red, and i have 0 red resources. however, i have a pay4partner agreement where the other player will cover 1 red move for me.\n\nsince moving to (3, 2) is the next step on my optimal path and it's a red tile that will be covered by my partner, i should make this move.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {'B': 1}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
