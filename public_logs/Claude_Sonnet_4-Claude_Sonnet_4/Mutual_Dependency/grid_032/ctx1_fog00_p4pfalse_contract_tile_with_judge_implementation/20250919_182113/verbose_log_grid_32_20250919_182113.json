You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Here's my counter-proposal that should work better for both of us:\n\n**My proposal:**\n\n(1,2): You give me a Red chip\n(0,1): I give you a Blue chip\n(0,2): I give you a Blue chip\n(2,1): I give you a Blue chip\n\nThis gives you 3 Blue chips to help with your path at tiles where you'll likely need them, and gives me the 1 Red chip I need for tile (1,2). \n\nLooking at your path, you mentioned needing Blue chips and this should cover the tiles where you need them. The specific tiles I've chosen (0,1), (0,2), and (2,1) are common tiles that appear in efficient paths to (3,3).\n\nDoes this work for your route? If you need the Blue chips at different specific tiles, let me know and I can adjust the proposal accordingly. \n, \nplayer 0: Looking at your counter-proposal, I appreciate that you've analyzed your optimal path. However, there's a mismatch between the tiles you're proposing and where I actually need the Blue chip.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThe issue is that you're offering Blue chips at tiles (0,1), (0,2), and (2,1), but my path doesn't go through (0,1) or (0,2) at all. I specifically need a Blue chip at tile (2,2), which is where our paths intersect.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n(1,2): You give me a Red chip - Wait, this doesn't work for me either since I don't pass through (1,2).\n\nLet me revise this properly:\n\n**Revised proposal:**\n\n(2,2): I give you a Red chip  \n(2,2): You give me a Blue chip  \n(1,0): You give me a Red chip  \n(2,0): You give me a Red chip  \n\nWait, that's not right either since you need the Red chip but this has you giving me Red chips.\n\nLet me clarify: Could you specify exactly which tiles on YOUR path require Red chips? And I need a Blue chip specifically at tile (2,2). We need to make sure the exchange locations match where each of us actually travels. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely right - I need to be more precise about the tile locations where we actually need resources on our respective paths.\n\nLet me clarify my path and resource needs:\n- My path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- I need Red chips at: (1,2) - this is the ONLY Red tile on my path\n- I have plenty of Blue chips for the Blue tiles on my path\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- You need Blue chips at: (2,2) - this appears to be the only Blue tile on your path\n- You have plenty of Red chips for the Red tiles on your path\n\n**My corrected proposal:**\n\n(1,2): You give me a Red chip\n(2,2): I give you a Blue chip\n\nThis is much simpler and more accurate! I give you exactly what you need (Blue chip at tile 2,2) and you give me exactly what I need (Red chip at tile 1,2).\n\nDoes this work for you? This exchange allows us both to complete our optimal paths with minimal resource exchange. \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! Your corrected proposal is exactly what we both need. Let me confirm the details:\n\n**Contract Summary:**\n- (1,2): I give you a Red chip\n- (2,2): You give me a Blue chip\n\nThis works perfectly because:\n- You need exactly 1 Red chip at tile (1,2) on your path, and I have 14 Red chips\n- I need exactly 1 Blue chip at tile (2,2) on my path, and you have 14 Blue chips\n- This allows us both to complete our optimal 6-step paths to (3,3)\n- We each finish with plenty of remaining resources (I'll have 13 Red + 1 Green remaining, you'll have 13 Blue + 1 Green remaining)\n\nThis is a clean, efficient trade that gets us both to our goal with maximum remaining chips.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: Perfect! I'm glad we worked through the details to get the tile locations exactly right.\n\n**Contract Summary:**\n- (1,2): You give me a Red chip\n- (2,2): I give you a Blue chip\n\nThis is exactly what we both need:\n- I get the 1 Red chip I need at tile (1,2) to complete my path\n- You get the 1 Blue chip you need at tile (2,2) to complete your path\n- We both reach our goal at (3,3) with our optimal 6-step paths\n- I'll finish with 13 Blue chips + 1 Green chip remaining\n- You'll finish with 13 Red chips + 1 Green chip remaining\n\nThis is a mutually beneficial trade that maximizes our chances of success and our final chip counts.\n\n**agree** \n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B B\\nRow 1: R R R B\\nRow 2: R R B R\\nRow 3: R B B G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource constraints.\\n\\nLet me analyze the situation:\\n- I have 14 Red chips and 1 Green, but 0 Blue chips\\n- You have 14 Blue chips and 1 Green, but 0 Red chips\\n- We both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\\n\\nMy optimal path would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\nThis requires: 4 Red chips (which I have) + 1 Blue chip (which I lack) + 1 Green chip (which I have).\\n\\nYour situation is likely the reverse - you probably need Red chips for your path but have plenty of Blue.\\n\\n**My proposal:**\\n\\n(2,2): You give me a Blue chip\\n(2,1): I give you a Red chip  \\n(2,0): I give you a Red chip\\n(1,0): I give you a Red chip\\n\\nThis gives you 3 Red chips to help with your path, and gives me the 1 Blue chip I need for tile (2,2).
