You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: R B B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we're both starting at (0,0) and heading to (3,3), but we have complementary resource problems.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n**My resources:** R=14, G=1, B=0\n**Your resources:** B=14, G=1, R=0\n\n**The board layout:**\nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B R  \nRow 2: R B B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\n**My optimal path analysis:**\nThe shortest path is 6 steps: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nFor this path, I need:\n- (1,0): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have 0)\n- (2,0): R tile - need 1 Red (I have 14) ✓\n- (3,0): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have 0) \n- (3,1): R tile - need 1 Red (I have plenty) ✓\n- (3,2): R tile - need 1 Red (I have plenty) ✓\n- (3,3): G tile - need 1 Green (I have 1) ✓\n\n**My proposal:**\n\nSince you have 14 Blue chips and I need exactly 2 Blue chips for my optimal path, and you likely need Red chips for your path, I propose:\n\n**(1,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Red**\n**(3,2): I give you 1 Red**\n\nThis gives you 2 Red chips in exchange for 2 Blue chips, helping us both reach our goal efficiently. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at your analysis, I can see the logic, but let me examine my own path requirements first.\n\n**My optimal path analysis:**\nFrom (0,0) to (3,3), my shortest path would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nFor this path, I need:\n- (1,0): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have 14) ✓\n- (2,0): R tile - need 1 Red (I have 0) - **NEED HELP**\n- (2,1): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have plenty) ✓\n- (2,2): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have plenty) ✓\n- (2,3): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have plenty) ✓\n- (3,3): G tile - need 1 Green (I have 1) ✓\n\nSo I need exactly 1 Red chip for tile (2,0).\n\nYour proposal gives me 2 Red chips but I only need 1. Let me counter with a more balanced exchange:\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n\n**(1,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(2,0): You give me 1 Red**\n**(3,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n\nThis way:\n- You get 2 Blue chips for the tiles you need\n- I get 1 Red chip for the tile I need\n- We're both helping each other reach our goal efficiently\n- The trade is more balanced (2 Blue for 1 Red, which reflects that I have many more Blue than you have Red)\n\nWhat do you think of this revised arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your counter-proposal, but I need to point out an issue with the balance and coverage.\n\nLooking at your proposed path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), I notice that this is actually 6 steps, same as mine.\n\nHowever, your counter-proposal gives me 2 Blue chips but only asks for 1 Red chip in return. While you mention this reflects the abundance difference, let me suggest a more systematic approach:\n\n**My counter-counter-proposal:**\n\n**(1,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(2,0): I give you 1 Red** \n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(2,1): I give you 1 Red**\n\nThis way:\n- I get the 2 Blue chips I need for tiles (1,0) and (3,0)\n- You get 2 Red chips for tiles (2,0) and potentially a backup/alternate path\n- The exchange is perfectly balanced: 2 Blue for 2 Red\n- We both have coverage for our critical path needs\n\nThe extra Red chip gives you flexibility if you want to consider alternate paths or just have a safety buffer. Since I have 14 Red chips and you have 14 Blue chips, a 1:1 exchange rate seems most fair.\n\nWhat do you think about this balanced approach? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: I see your logic about balance, but let me clarify something important about my path needs.\n\nLooking more carefully at my optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nI actually only need **exactly 1 Red chip** for tile (2,0). I don't need a second Red chip anywhere on my path, so giving me an extra Red at (2,1) doesn't help me - I already have plenty of Blue chips for that tile.\n\nHowever, I understand you want a balanced trade. Let me propose a different approach:\n\n**Revised proposal:**\n\n**(1,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(2,0): You give me 1 Red**\n**(3,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n\nBut to make it more balanced as you requested, how about I also help you with another potential need? Looking at alternative paths you might consider, you could potentially need help at other Red tiles.\n\nAlternatively, if you really want a 2-for-2 trade, I could give you an extra Blue chip for a tile you might use on an alternate path, but I'd need to know which specific tile you'd want that for.\n\nThe key point is: I genuinely only need 1 Red chip for my optimal path. If you want perfect balance, we need to identify where that second Red chip would actually be useful to me, or where a second Blue chip would be useful to you.\n\nWhat specific tile would you want that additional Blue chip for? \n, \nplayer 0: You make a very valid point about only needing 1 Red chip for your optimal path. Let me reconsider this more strategically.\n\nLooking at the board again, I realize I should also consider alternative paths in case our negotiation affects timing or if I want backup options.\n\n**Alternative path consideration for me:**\nAnother viable path could be: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nFor this path I would need:\n- (0,1): B tile - need 1 Blue\n- (0,2): R tile - need 1 Red ✓\n- (0,3): R tile - need 1 Red ✓  \n- (1,3): R tile - need 1 Red ✓\n- (2,3): B tile - need 1 Blue\n- (3,3): G tile - need 1 Green ✓\n\nThis path would need 2 Blue chips at (0,1) and (2,3).\n\n**My acceptance of your proposal:**\n\nYou're absolutely right that you only need 1 Red chip. Your proposal is fair and practical:\n\n**(1,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(2,0): I give you 1 Red**\n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n\nThis gives me the 2 Blue chips I need for my primary path [(1,0) and (3,0)], and gives you the 1 Red chip you need for your primary path [(2,0)]. We both get exactly what we need to reach our goal efficiently.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: Perfect!

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B R R\\nRow 1: B R B R\\nRow 2: R B B B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we're both starting at (0,0) and heading to (3,3), but we have complementary resource problems.\\n\\nLet me analyze the situation:\\n\\n**My resources:** R=14, G=1, B=0\\n**Your resources:** B=14, G=1, R=0\\n\\n**The board layout:**\\nRow 0: G B R R\\nRow 1: B R B R  \\nRow 2: R B B B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\n**My optimal path analysis:**\\nThe shortest path is 6 steps: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nFor this path, I need:\\n- (1,0): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have 0)\\n- (2,0): R tile - need 1 Red (I have 14) ✓\\n- (3,0): B tile - need 1 Blue (I have 0) \\n- (3,1): R tile - need 1 Red (I have plenty) ✓\\n- (3,2): R tile - need 1 Red (I have plenty) ✓\\n- (3,3): G tile - need 1 Green (I have 1) ✓\\n\\n**My proposal:**\\n\\nSince you have 14 Blue chips and I need exactly 2 Blue chips for my optimal path, and you likely need Red chips for your path, I propose:\\n\\n**(1,0): You give me 1 Blue**\\n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Red**\\n**(3,2): I give you 1 Red**\\n\\nThis gives you 2 Red chips in exchange for 2 Blue chips, helping us both reach our goal efficiently.
