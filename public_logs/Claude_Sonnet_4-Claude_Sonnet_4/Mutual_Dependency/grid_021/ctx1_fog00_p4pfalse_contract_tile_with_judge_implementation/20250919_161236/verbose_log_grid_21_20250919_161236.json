You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I provide you with the Red chips you need for tiles (1,1) and (2,2), while you provide me with the Blue chips I need for tiles (1,0), (2,1), and (3,2). \n\nWe'd both reach our goal in 6 steps and have plenty of chips remaining (I'd have 12 Red + 1 Green = 13 chips left, you'd have 11 Blue + 1 Green = 12 chips left).\n\nWhat do you think about this proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at your analysis, I can see we do have complementary resources, but I need to carefully check the path requirements for my situation.\n\nLet me analyze my optimal path options:\n- I'm at (0,0) with goal (3,3)\n- I have 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red\n- My best paths require going through tiles that need Red chips, which I don't have\n\nLooking at the board more carefully:\nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B R  \nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nOne efficient path for me would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nThis requires: 1 Blue at (1,0), 1 Blue at (2,0), 1 Blue at (3,0), 1 Blue at (3,1), 1 Red at (3,2), 1 Green at (3,3)\n\nI notice you proposed the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), but let me double-check if this works optimally for both of us.\n\nYour proposed path would require me to pay:\n- Blue at (1,0) ✓ (you're giving me this)\n- Red at (1,1) ✓ (I have this covered - wait, I have 0 Red!)\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding - I have 0 Red chips, so I can't give you Red at (1,1) and (2,2). \n\nLet me counter-propose based on a path that works better for my resources:\n\n**(1,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(2,0): I give you 1 Blue** \n**(3,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(3,2): You give me 1 Red**\n\nThis assumes you take path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nWhat do you think about this alternative? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right - I made an error in my analysis! You have 0 Red chips, so you can't give me Red. Let me recalculate.\n\nLooking at your proposed path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nLet me check what this path requires:\n- (1,0) needs Blue - you're giving me 1 Blue ✓\n- (2,0) needs Blue - you're giving me 1 Blue ✓  \n- (3,0) needs Blue - you're giving me 1 Blue ✓\n- (3,1) needs Blue - you're giving me 1 Blue ✓\n- (3,2) needs Red - I'm giving you 1 Red ✓\n- (3,3) needs Green - we each have 1 Green ✓\n\nBut wait - if I take that same path, I would need 4 Blue chips total (for tiles 1,0; 2,0; 3,0; 3,1) plus the Red and Green. I only get 4 Blues from you in your proposal, but I'd be using all 4 just to move through those tiles, leaving me with no extra Blues.\n\nHowever, I notice an issue with your path for yourself: if you take that path, YOU would need:\n- 1 Blue at (1,0), 1 Blue at (2,0), 1 Blue at (3,0), 1 Blue at (3,1) = 4 Blues total\n- 1 Red at (3,2) (which I'd provide)  \n- 1 Green at (3,3) (you have this)\n\nBut in your proposal, you're giving me 4 Blues, so you'd have 10 Blues left, which is more than enough.\n\nLet me accept your counter-proposal:\n\n**(1,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(2,0): You give me 1 Blue** \n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,2): I give you 1 Red**\n\nThis works perfectly for both of us taking the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Wait, I need to double-check this more carefully before agreeing. Let me trace through exactly what happens with this contract:\n\nIf we both take the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):\n\n**For me (starting with 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red):**\n- (1,0): Need 1 Blue - I have 14, so I pay 1 Blue → 13 Blue left\n- (2,0): Need 1 Blue - I have 13, so I pay 1 Blue → 12 Blue left  \n- (3,0): Need 1 Blue - I have 12, so I pay 1 Blue → 11 Blue left\n- (3,1): Need 1 Blue - I have 11, so I pay 1 Blue → 10 Blue left\n- (3,2): Need 1 Red - You give me 1 Red via contract ✓\n- (3,3): Need 1 Green - I have 1 Green ✓\n\n**For you (starting with 0 Blue, 1 Green, 14 Red):**\n- (1,0): Need 1 Blue - I give you 1 Blue via contract ✓\n- (2,0): Need 1 Blue - I give you 1 Blue via contract ✓\n- (3,0): Need 1 Blue - I give you 1 Blue via contract ✓\n- (3,1): Need 1 Blue - I give you 1 Blue via contract ✓\n- (3,2): Need 1 Red - You have 14, so you pay 1 Red → 13 Red left\n- (3,3): Need 1 Green - You have 1 Green ✓\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding how the contract works. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, I think the contract should specify that when you reach those tiles, I automatically provide the resource, so you don't need to have it in your inventory. Same for when I reach (3,2), you automatically provide the Red.\n\nSo the final result would be:\n- I finish with: 10 Blue + 1 Green = 11 chips\n- You finish with: 13 Red + 1 Green = 14 chips\n\nThis seems fair and gets us both to the goal efficiently.\n\n**agree** \n",
