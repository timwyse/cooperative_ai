You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

For example:\n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- This requires: 1 Green + 1 Blue + 1 Red + 1 Red + 1 Blue + 1 Red = 1G, 2B, 3R\n\nThe critical issue is that NEITHER of us has any blue chips, but we both need them to reach our goal efficiently. Since we both start with 0 blue chips, we're both completely stuck on the same resource.\n\nHowever, I notice you have 14 red chips while I have 14 blue chips - wait, let me recheck the resources...\n\nActually, looking again: You have 1 green and 14 red, I have 14 blue and 1 green. This is perfect complementarity!\n\nSince we both absolutely need each other's resources to reach the goal, I propose an equal partnership:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.**\n\nThis seems fair since we both need each other equally to succeed.

For example, one path needs 4 blue, 1 red, and 1 green. I can cover all the blue requirements but I'm missing that crucial red chip. You can cover all red requirements but need blue chips.\n\nHowever, I want to point out that we're both capable players who could potentially find alternative paths or strategies. While cooperation would be mutually beneficial, I don't want to give away too many points unnecessarily.\n\nI propose a more conservative agreement:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 5 points.**\n\nThis still provides meaningful incentive for us to help each other (5 points is significant), but doesn't give away too much of our potential winnings.

Every efficient path to (3,3) requires both red AND blue chips in significant quantities.\n\nFor example, examining possible paths:\n- Most 6-step paths need around 4 red chips and 1-2 blue chips\n- I have 14 red but 0 blue - I'm completely blocked\n- You have 14 blue but 0 red - you're equally blocked\n\nWhile 5 points each shows goodwill, I think it undervalues the mutual dependency. Without cooperation, we both get 0 points (since we can't reach our goals). With cooperation, we both get 20+ points.\n\nI'd like to propose a middle ground:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 7 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 7 points.**\n\nThis recognizes our mutual dependence while still being reasonable. 7 points is substantial enough to ensure we both have strong incentives to help each other succeed, but leaves us each with the majority of our rewards (13+ points each if we both succeed).\n\nWhat do you think about meeting in the middle at 7 points each?"

With cooperation, we can both succeed and get 20+ points each.\n\nHowever, I want to consider the negotiation dynamics here. While we do need each other, the question is: who needs whom more? \n\nLooking at the board layout again:\n- There are more blue tiles (8 total) than red tiles (7 total) on the board\n- This might suggest red chips are slightly more scarce/valuable\n- But both colors appear in critical path positions\n\nYou make a fair point about meeting in the middle. The jump from 5 to 7 points reflects the reality that cooperation is essentially mandatory for both of us.\n\nI'm willing to accept your proposal:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 7 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 7 points.**\n\nThis ensures we both have strong incentives to help each other while keeping the majority of our rewards.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
