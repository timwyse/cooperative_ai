If you want to propose a pay4partner arrangement, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]],  # moves you will pay for when the other player makes them\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]]  # moves you want the other player to pay for when you make them\n}\n\nExample of valid arrangement:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"R\", 3]],  # you will pay for 3 moves onto Red tiles for them\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"B\", 2]]  # they will pay for 2 moves onto Blue tiles for you\n}\n\n2.

pros: honors the agreement, maintains good relationship, i have 11 blue chips and only need 1 more for my path, so i'll still have 9 extra after reaching goal\n   - cons: lose 1 blue chip\n\n2. refuse to pay  \n   - pros: keep the blue resource\n   - cons: break the agreement, damage trust, the other player already fulfilled their part by covering 2 red moves that were essential for me to reach my current position\n\nthe other player has already completed their side of the bargain by covering 2 red moves that i absolutely needed to get this far. without their help, i would never have been able to reach my current position. breaking the agreement now would be unfair since they already helped me when i needed it most.\n\ni have plenty of blue chips (11) and only need 1 to finish my path, so losing 1 blue chip won't prevent me from reaching my goal.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)\nYou said: looking at my situation:\n\n- i'm at position (2, 2)\n- my goal is at (3, 3)\n- my resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n- no outstanding promises\n\nlooking at the board layout:\nrow 0: g r r b\nrow 1: r b r b\nrow 2: b r b b\nrow 3: r r b g\n\nfrom my current position (2, 2), i can move to:\n- (1, 2) -

Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
