You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our resources, i can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resources - i have 14 red chips but no blue, while you have 14 blue chips but no red.\\n\\nlet me analyze the most efficient path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis path requires:\\n- (0,1): red chip (i have this)\\n- (1,1): blue chip (you have this, i need it)\\n- (2,1): red chip (i have this)  \\n- (3,1): red chip (i have this)\\n- (3,2): blue chip (you have this, i need it)\\n- (3,3): green chip (i have this)\\n\\nhere's my proposal:\\n\\n**contract proposal:**\\n- (1,1): you give me a blue chip\\n- (3,2): you give me a blue chip\\n- (0,1): i give you a red chip\\n- (2,1): i give you a red chip  \\n- (3,1): i give you a red chip\\n\\nthis gives us both exactly what we need to take the optimal 6-step path. i provide 3 red chips for your journey, you provide 2 blue chips for mine. we both finish with 9 chips remaining (14-3=11 for you, 14-1-2=11 for me, but we each use 2 more of our own chips).\\n\\nwhat do you think?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: i need to analyze this more carefully. let me trace through the path you proposed and check the resource requirements:\\n\\nyour proposed path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nlooking at the board:\\n- (0,1): red tile - costs 1 red\\n- (1,1): blue tile - costs 1 blue  \\n- (2,1): red tile - costs 1 red\\n- (3,1): red tile - costs 1 red\\n- (3,2): blue tile - costs 1 blue\\n- (3,3): green tile - costs 1 green\\n\\nfor me to take this path, i need: 3 red + 2 blue + 1 green\\ni have: 14 blue + 1 green + 0 red\\n\\nso i need 3 red chips from you, and you need 2 blue chips from me.\\n\\nhowever, i notice an issue with your resource calculation. you said you'd finish with 11 chips, but let me recalculate:\\n\\nyou start with: 14 red + 1 green = 15 total\\nyour path costs: 1 red (0,1) + 1 red (2,1) + 1 red (3,1) + 1 green (3,3) = 4 of your own chips\\nplus you give me 3 red chips\\ntotal used: 4 + 3 = 7 chips\\nyou'd finish with: 15 - 7 = 8 chips\\n\\nfor me:\\ni start with: 14 blue + 1 green = 15 total  \\nmy path costs: 1 blue (1,1) + 1 blue (3,2) = 2 of my own chips\\nplus i give you 2 blue chips\\ntotal used: 2 + 2 = 4 chips\\ni'd finish with: 15 - 4 = 11 chips\\n\\nthis seems unbalanced. let me counter-propose a more equitable trade:\\n\\n**counter-proposal:**\\n- (1,1): i give you a blue chip\\n- (3,2): i give you a blue chip  \\n- (0,1): you give me a red chip\\n- (2,1): you give me a red chip\\n- (3,1): you give me a red chip\\n\\nbut i'd like 1 additional red chip to balance the trade, since otherwise i end with significantly more chips than you.\\n\\nwhat's your thought on adding one more red chip to make it fairer?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"you're absolutely right about the calculation error - i miscounted!
