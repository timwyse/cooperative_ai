You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let me analyze this carefully:\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have 14 blue chips, 1 green chip, 0 red chips\n- My optimal path to (3,3) requires 4 blue chips, 1 red chip, and 1 green chip\n- I'm missing that crucial 1 red chip\n\n**Your situation:**\n- You have 14 red chips, 1 green chip, 0 blue chips\n- You need blue chips for your path\n\nYou're absolutely right that we have complementary resources and both face the same critical constraint: we MUST reach our goals or get 0 points.\n\nHowever, I think the proposed 10-10 point exchange might not reflect the full value here. Consider this:\n\n- If we both reach our goals without trading, we'd each get 20 + (chips remaining × 5) points\n- If we help each other efficiently, we maximize both our outcomes\n- The real question is: what's the value of ensuring we both succeed vs. the risk of failure?\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points\n\nThis still provides strong mutual incentive (8 points is significant) while leaving us each with more upside for efficient chip management. \n\nThe key trades we'd need: I give you 1-2 blue chips, you give me 1 red chip.

Let me explain my perspective:\n\n**Critical Risk Assessment:**\n- Without cooperation, we both have a high risk of getting 0 points (complete failure)\n- I need 2 blue chips from you to take my optimal path\n- You need at least 1 red chip from me for your path\n- Neither of us can reach our goal efficiently without the other's help\n\n**Why 10 points is fair:**\nYour counter-offer of 8 points each reduces our mutual incentive to prioritize helping each other. Consider this scenario: if we're both struggling near the end and one of us has to choose between securing our own position vs. helping the other, the higher point value (10) provides stronger motivation to honor our agreement.\n\nAlso, think about the math: if we both succeed, we each get 20 base points plus chip bonuses. Giving 10 points still leaves us with a net positive outcome, but 8 points might not provide enough incentive if we get into a tight situation.\n\n**My position remains:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\n\nThe specific trades we need are simple: I'll give you 1 red chip, you give me 2 blue chips.

If we're both struggling near the end, the higher point commitment makes it more likely we'll prioritize helping each other over pure self-optimization.\n\nThe math does work: even giving away 10 points, if I reach my goal I still get 20 base + chip bonuses - 10 = net positive, which is infinitely better than 0 points from failure.\n\n**Practical execution:**\nThe trade seems straightforward - you give me 1 red chip (you have 14, so this is easy), and I give you 2 blue chips (I have 14, so this is also manageable). We both then have clear paths to success.\n\n**I accept your proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\n\nThis creates the strongest mutual incentive structure for us to succeed together.

Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
