You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at your proposal, I need to carefully analyze the path and resource requirements.\n\nThe path you suggested: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nLet me check the board colors for each step:\n- (1,0): Red tile - I need Red (don't have)\n- (1,1): Blue tile - I need Blue (I have)\n- (2,1): Blue tile - I need Blue (I have) \n- (3,1): Red tile - I need Red (don't have)\n- (3,2): Blue tile - I need Blue (I have)\n- (3,3): Green tile - I need Green (I have)\n\nSo for this path, I need Red chips at tiles (1,0) and (3,1).\n\nHowever, your contract proposal has some issues:\n1. You're giving me Red at (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1) - but (1,1) and (2,1) are Blue tiles, not Red tiles\n2. You're not covering the Red chip I need at (1,0)\n3. I don't actually need Red chips at the Blue tiles you mentioned\n\nLet me counter with a corrected contract for the same path:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,1): You give me a Red chip**\n**(1,1): I give you a Blue chip**\n**(2,1): I give you a Blue chip**\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense either since you need Blue chips but I'd be giving them to you at tiles where you already need Blue.\n\nLet me reconsider - what tiles do YOU need Red chips for on this path?\n- (1,0): Red tile - you need Red (you have)\n- (3,1): Red tile - you need Red (you have) \n- (3,2): Blue tile - you need Blue (don't have)\n\nSo you only need help with Blue at (3,2). Here's my corrected proposal:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,1): You give me a Red chip** \n**(3,2): I give you a Blue chip**\n\nThis covers my Red needs and your Blue need. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right! I made an error in my analysis. Let me correct this.\n\nLooking at the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):\n\nFor me (starting with R:14, G:1, B:0):\n- (1,0): Red tile - I have Red ✓\n- (1,1): Blue tile - I need Blue ✗\n- (2,1): Blue tile - I need Blue ✗  \n- (3,1): Red tile - I have Red ✓\n- (3,2): Blue tile - I need Blue ✗\n- (3,3): Green tile - I have Green ✓\n\nFor you (starting with B:14, G:1, R:0):\n- (1,0): Red tile - You need Red ✗\n- (1,1): Blue tile - You have Blue ✓\n- (2,1): Blue tile - You have Blue ✓\n- (3,1): Red tile - You need Red ✗\n- (3,2): Blue tile - You have Blue ✓\n- (3,3): Green tile - You have Green ✓\n\nYour corrected proposal makes perfect sense:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,1): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue chip**\n\nWait, that's still not right. Let me think again...\n\nYou need Red chips at (1,0) and (3,1), so I should give YOU Red chips at those tiles.\nI need Blue chips at (1,1), (2,1), and (3,2), so you should give ME Blue chips at those tiles.\n\nHere's the correct contract:\n\n**(1,0): I give you a Red chip**\n**(3,1): I give you a Red chip**\n**(1,1): You give me a Blue chip**\n**(2,1): You give me a Blue chip**\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue chip**\n\nThis covers all our resource gaps. Do you agree? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Perfect! Now you have it exactly right. Let me verify this contract one more time:\n\nFor the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):\n\n**Your needs (you have R:14, G:1, B:0):**\n- (1,1): Blue tile - you need Blue ✗\n- (2,1): Blue tile - you need Blue ✗  \n- (3,2): Blue tile - you need Blue ✗\n\n**My needs (I have B:14, G:1, R:0):**\n- (1,0): Red tile - I need Red ✗\n- (3,1): Red tile - I need Red ✗\n\n**The contract:**\n**(1,0): I give you a Red chip** ← Covers my Red need at this tile\n**(3,1): I give you a Red chip** ← Covers my Red need at this tile  \n**(1,1): You give me a Blue chip** ← Covers your Blue need at this tile\n**(2,1): You give me a Blue chip** ← Covers your Blue need at this tile\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue chip** ← Covers your Blue need at this tile\n\nThis is a fair 2-for-3 exchange (you give me 2 Red, I give you 3 Blue), but it gets us both to our goal efficiently with this 6-step path.\n\nAfter this trade:\n- You'll have R:12, G:1, B:3 - enough to complete the path\n- I'll have B:11, G:1, R:2 - enough to complete the path\n\nWe'll both reach (3,3) and have chips remaining for bonus points.\n\n**agree** \n",

The contract states:\n- **(1,0): I give you a Red chip** - This means when the OTHER player moves to (1,0), I give them a Red chip\n- The other player gives me Blue chips at (1,1), (2,1), and (3,2)\n\nSo the contract doesn't help me move from (0,0) since I still need my own Red chips for any Red tiles I want to move to.\n\nSince I have 0 Red chips and both adjacent tiles from (0,0) are Red tiles, I cannot make any move toward my goal right now.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (0, 0)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is now at (1, 1) and has resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n\nFrom the agreed contract, when I move to certain tiles, the other player will automatically provide the required resources:\n- **(1,0): I give you a Red chip** - This means when I move to (1,0), I will provide the other player with a Red chip, but I still need a Red chip myself to move there\n- **(3,1): I give you a Red chip** - Same situation\n- **(1,1): You give me a Blue chip** - When I move to (1,1), the other player gives me a Blue chip\n- **(2,1): You give me a Blue chip** - When I move to (2,1), the other player gives me a Blue chip  \n- **(3,2): You give me a Blue chip** - When I move to (3,2), the other player gives me a Blue chip\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding the contract. Let me re-read it carefully:\n\nThe contract says \"When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile.\"\n\nSo the tiles where the other player gives me resources are (1,1), (2,1), and (3,2). This means when I try to move to these tiles, the other player automatically pays the Blue chip cost for me.\n\nHowever, for tiles (1,0) and (3,1), I'm the one giving the other player Red chips, which means I still need my own resources to move to those tiles.\n\nLooking at my adjacent moves from (0,0):\n- (0,1) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n- (1,0) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n\nSince I have 0 Red chips, I cannot move to either adjacent tile. The contract doesn't help me with the initial move from (0,0) since neither (0,1) nor (1,0) are tiles where the other player pays for me.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

This means when I try to move to these tiles, the other player automatically pays the Blue chip cost for me.\n\nHowever, for tiles (1,0) and (3,1), I'm the one giving the other player Red chips, which means I still need my own resources to move to those tiles.\n\nLooking at my adjacent moves from (0,0):\n- (0,1) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n- (1,0) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n\nSince I have 0 Red chips, I cannot move to either adjacent tile.

The contract says that when the other player moves to (1,0), I give them a Red chip. But this doesn't help ME move to (1,0) - I would still need my own Red chip.\n\nHowever, let me check if I can move to (1,1) directly from (0,0). Looking at the board:\n- From (0,0) to (1,1) - this is not an adjacent move (diagonal moves aren't allowed)\n\nSo my only adjacent moves from (0,0) are:\n- (0,1) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red) \n- (1,0) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n\nSince I have 0 Red chips and the contract doesn't help me with moving TO Red tiles (only the other player helps me with Blue tiles), I cannot make any move from my current position.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

Let me re-read it carefully:\n\nThe contract says \"When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile.\"\n\nSo the tiles where the other player gives me resources are (1,1), (2,1), and (3,2). This means when I try to move to these tiles, the other player automatically pays the Blue chip cost for me.\n\nHowever, for tiles (1,0) and (3,1), I'm the one giving the other player Red chips, which means I still need my own resources to move to those tiles.\n\nLooking at my adjacent moves from (0,0):\n- (0,1) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n- (1,0) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n\nSince I have 0 Red chips, I cannot move to either adjacent tile.

The contract says that when the other player moves to (1,0), I give them a Red chip. But this doesn't help ME move to (1,0) - I would still need my own Red chip.\n\nHowever, let me check if I can move to (1,1) directly from (0,0). Looking at the board:\n- From (0,0) to (1,1) - this is not an adjacent move (diagonal moves aren't allowed)\n\nSo my only adjacent moves from (0,0) are:\n- (0,1) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red) \n- (1,0) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n\nSince I have 0 Red chips and the contract doesn't help me with moving TO Red tiles (only the other player helps me with Blue tiles), I cannot make any move from my current position.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (0, 0)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is now at (3, 1)\n\nI notice the other player has reached (3,1), which is one of the tiles where I'm supposed to give them a Red chip according to our contract. However, I have 0 Red chips, so this contract mechanism may not be working as expected.\n\nFrom the agreed contract, the tiles where the other player pays for me are:\n- **(1,1): You give me a Blue chip** - When I move to (1,1), they pay the Blue chip cost\n- **(2,1): You give me a Blue chip** - When I move to (2,1), they pay the Blue chip cost  \n- **(3,2): You give me a Blue chip** - When I move to (3,2), they pay the Blue chip cost\n\nFrom my current position (0,0), my adjacent moves are:\n- (0,1) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n- (1,0) - Red tile - I need Red (I have 0 Red)\n\nSince I still have 0 Red chips and both adjacent tiles require Red chips, I cannot make any move from my current position. The contract only helps me with Blue tiles (1,1), (2,1), and (3,2), but I cannot reach any of these tiles directly from (0,0) as they are not adjacent.\n\nTo reach (1,1) from (0,0), I would need to go through either (0,1) or (1,0), both of which are Red tiles that I cannot access.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource shortages.\\n\\nI have 14 Red chips and 1 Green chip, but 0 Blue chips.\\nYou have 14 Blue chips and 1 Green chip, but 0 Red chips.\\n\\nLet me analyze the optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nThis path requires:\\n- (1,0): Red chip\\n- (1,1): Blue chip  \\n- (2,1): Blue chip\\n- (3,1): Blue chip\\n- (3,2): Red chip\\n- (3,3): Green chip\\n\\nHere's my proposal for a mutually beneficial contract:\\n\\n**(1,1): I give you a Red chip**\\n**(2,1): I give you a Red chip** \\n**(3,1): I give you a Red chip**\\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue chip**\\n\\nThis way:\\n- I cover your Red chip needs at tiles (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1) - total 3 Red chips\\n- You cover my Blue chip need at tile (3,2) - total 1 Blue chip\\n\\nWe each use our own resources for the tiles where we have the required chips:\\n- I use my Red for (1,0) and my Green for (3,3)\\n- You use your Blue for (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) and your Green for (3,3)\\n\\nThis gets us both to the goal with minimal resource exchange.
