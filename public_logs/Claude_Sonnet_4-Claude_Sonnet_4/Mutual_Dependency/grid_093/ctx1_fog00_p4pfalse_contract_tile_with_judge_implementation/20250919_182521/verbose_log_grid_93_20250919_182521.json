You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: R B B B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let me revise:\n\n**(1,0): I give you a Red chip**\n**(2,0): I give you a Red chip**\n**(3,0): You give me a Blue chip**\n**(3,1): I give you a Red chip**\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue chip**\n**(3,3): You give me a Green chip**\n\nThis way, I provide you with the 3 Red chips you need for tiles (1,0), (2,0), and (3,1), and you provide me with the 2 Blue chips I need for tiles (3,0) and (3,2), plus the Green chip for the final tile since we both only have 1 Green chip.\n\nWhat do you think of this arrangement? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at your proposal, I notice there's an issue with the Green chip allocation. We both have only 1 Green chip each, and the final tile (3,3) requires a Green chip. Your proposal has you giving me your Green chip, but then you wouldn't have one for your own move to (3,3).\n\nLet me analyze the path you suggested: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis path requires:\n- (1,0): Red chip - I need this, you can provide\n- (2,0): Red chip - I need this, you can provide  \n- (3,0): Blue chip - You need this, I can provide\n- (3,1): Red chip - You need this, you have plenty\n- (3,2): Blue chip - You need this, I can provide\n- (3,3): Green chip - We both need this for our own moves\n\nSince we each only have 1 Green chip and we both need to end at (3,3), we each need to use our own Green chip for that final move.\n\nHere's my counter-proposal:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(2,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,0): I give you a Blue chip**\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue chip**\n\nThis covers the tiles where we need each other's resources. For (3,1), you can use your own Red chip, and for (3,3), we each use our own Green chip.\n\nThis trade gives me the 2 Red chips I need, and gives you the 2 Blue chips you need, while preserving our Green chips for our own final moves.\n\nWhat do you think of this revised arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right about the Green chip issue - I made an error there. We both need our own Green chips for the final move to (3,3).\n\nHowever, I think there's still a small issue with your counter-proposal. Let me trace through the path again:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): Red chip needed\n- (2,0): Red chip needed  \n- (3,0): Blue chip needed\n- (3,1): Red chip needed\n- (3,2): Blue chip needed\n- (3,3): Green chip needed\n\nYou mentioned that for (3,1), I can use my own Red chip, but actually YOU need a Red chip for (3,1) since you don't have any Red chips in your inventory.\n\nLet me revise the contract:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(2,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,0): I give you a Blue chip**\n**(3,1): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue chip**\n\nThis way:\n- I give you 3 Red chips total (for tiles where you need Red)\n- You give me 2 Blue chips total (for tiles where I need Blue)\n- We each keep our Green chip for our own final move to (3,3)\n\nThis should work perfectly - what do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely correct! I made an error in my analysis. You're right that I need Red chips for the tiles where Red is required, and I don't have any Red chips in my inventory.\n\nLet me trace through this carefully:\n\nFor me (starting with 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red):\n- (1,0): Need Red - you provide\n- (2,0): Need Red - you provide  \n- (3,0): Need Blue - I use my own\n- (3,1): Need Red - you provide\n- (3,2): Need Blue - I use my own\n- (3,3): Need Green - I use my own\n\nFor you (starting with 0 Blue, 1 Green, 14 Red):\n- (1,0): Need Red - you use your own\n- (2,0): Need Red - you use your own\n- (3,0): Need Blue - I provide\n- (3,1): Need Red - you use your own\n- (3,2): Need Blue - I provide\n- (3,3): Need Green - you use your own\n\nYour revised contract looks perfect:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(2,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,0): I give you a Blue chip**\n**(3,1): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue chip**\n\nThis gives me the 3 Red chips I need for tiles (1,0), (2,0), and (3,1), while I give you the 2 Blue chips you need for tiles (3,0) and (3,2). We each keep our Green chips for the final move.\n\nThis is a fair and efficient trade that gets us both to our goal with maximum remaining resources.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we worked through that analysis together and identified the correct resource exchanges needed for each tile.\n\nTo confirm our final contract:\n\n**(1,0): I give you a Red chip**\n**(2,0): I give you a Red chip**\n**(3,0): You give me a Blue chip**\n**(3,1): I give you a Red chip**\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue chip**\n\nThis ensures:\n- You get the 3 Red chips you need for the Red tiles along our path\n- I get the 2 Blue chips I need for the Blue tiles along our path\n- We both keep our Green chips for the final move to (3,3)\n- We both successfully reach our goal with optimal resource management\n\nAfter this trade, I'll have 11 Red chips + 1 Green chip remaining, and you'll have 12 Blue chips + 1 Green chip remaining, maximizing both our final scores.\n\n**agree** \n",
