You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

After reaching our goals, I'd have 11 Red + 1 Green = 12 chips remaining, and you'd have 12 Blue + 1 Green = 13 chips remaining.\n\nWhat do you think about this proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I appreciate your detailed analysis! However, I need to reconsider the path options more carefully.\n\nLooking at my analysis, my optimal path is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires:\n- (1,0): 1 Blue (I have)\n- (1,1): 1 Blue (I have) \n- (2,1): 1 Blue (I have)\n- (3,1): 1 Blue (I have)\n- (3,2): 1 Red (I need from you)\n- (3,3): 1 Green (I have)\n\nYour suggested path would work for you, but we need to coordinate so we don't interfere with each other's movement.\n\nLooking at your path and mine, I notice potential tile conflicts. Let me propose a revised contract that accounts for our different optimal paths:\n\n**My path needs:**\n- (3,2): I need 1 Red from you\n\n**Your path needs (assuming you take the western route):**\n- (1,0): You need 1 Blue from me  \n- (3,1): You need 1 Blue from me\n\n**Proposed contract:**\n**(1,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Blue** \n**(3,2): You give me 1 Red**\n\nThis is much more efficient - I only need 1 Red from you, and you only need 2 Blues from me. This leaves us both with more resources at the end.\n\nWhat do you think about this more streamlined approach? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your analysis, but I need to point out a critical issue with your proposed contract - it doesn't cover all the tiles where I need resources.\n\nLooking at my path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nI need Blue chips at multiple tiles, not just (1,0) and (3,1). Specifically:\n- (1,0): Blue tile - need 1 Blue\n- (2,0): Red tile - I have Red\n- (3,0): Red tile - I have Red  \n- (3,1): Blue tile - need 1 Blue\n- (3,2): Red tile - I have Red\n- (3,3): Green tile - I have Green\n\nSo your proposed contract only covers 2 of the tiles where I need Blue, but I actually need Blue at (1,0) and (3,1).\n\nWait, let me double-check the board layout:\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nYou're right that (1,0) and (3,1) are both Blue tiles. But I'm also seeing that (2,0) is Red and (3,0) is Red, which I do have.\n\nLet me revise - your streamlined contract actually does work for my path! I apologize for the confusion.\n\n**Revised contract acceptance:**\n**(1,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue** \n**(3,2): I give you 1 Red**\n\nThis works well - I get the 2 Blue chips I need, you get the 1 Red chip you need. We both reach our goal efficiently.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Wait! I need to stop you there. I'm looking at the board layout again and I think there's been a misunderstanding about which tiles need which resources.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R  \nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nYour proposed path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nBut looking at the coordinates:\n- (1,0) = Row 1, Column 0 = B (Blue tile)\n- (2,0) = Row 2, Column 0 = R (Red tile) \n- (3,0) = Row 3, Column 0 = R (Red tile)\n- (3,1) = Row 3, Column 1 = B (Blue tile)\n- (3,2) = Row 3, Column 2 = R (Red tile)\n\nSo you would need:\n- (1,0): 1 Blue\n- (2,0): 1 Red (you have)\n- (3,0): 1 Red (you have)\n- (3,1): 1 Blue  \n- (3,2): 1 Red (you have)\n\nThat means you need Blue chips at (1,0) and (3,1), which matches what I proposed.\n\nHowever, I want to double-check my own path analysis. My path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): B = need 1 Blue (I have)\n- (1,1): B = need 1 Blue (I have)  \n- (2,1): B = need 1 Blue (I have)\n- (3,1): B = need 1 Blue (I have)\n- (3,2): R = need 1 Red (I need from you)\n\nYes, my analysis is correct. So the contract should work:\n\n**(1,0): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): I give you 1 Blue**\n**(3,2): You give me 1 Red**\n\n**agree** \n",
