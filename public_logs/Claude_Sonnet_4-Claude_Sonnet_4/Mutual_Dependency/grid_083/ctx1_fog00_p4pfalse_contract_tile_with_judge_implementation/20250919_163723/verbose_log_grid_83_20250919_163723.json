You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Your proposal is very close to what I need, but let me trace through my optimal path to make sure we cover everything correctly.\n\nMy analysis of my best path to (3,3):\n- Start at (0,0) - no cost to stay\n- Move to (1,0): Need 1 Blue chip (I have this)\n- Move to (2,0): Need 1 Blue chip (I have this) \n- Move to (3,0): Need 1 Red chip (I don't have this - need from you)\n- Move to (3,1): Need 1 Blue chip (I have this)\n- Move to (3,2): Need 1 Red chip (I don't have this - need from you)\n- Move to (3,3): Need 1 Green chip (I have this)\n\nSo I need Red chips at tiles (3,0) and (3,2).\n\nYour proposal covers (3,2) but not (3,0). Let me counter with a slight modification:\n\n**Counter Proposal:**\n- (1,0): I give you 1 Blue chip\n- (2,0): I give you 1 Blue chip  \n- (3,0): You give me 1 Red chip\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Red chip\n\nThis is a clean 2-for-2 trade that gives us both exactly what we need for our optimal paths. You get the 2 Blue chips you need for your path, and I get the 2 Red chips I need for mine.\n\nDoes this work for your path planning? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your counter-proposal, but I think there might be a small misunderstanding about which tiles we each need help with.\n\nLet me clarify my path and needs:\n- I'm starting at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\n- My path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- I need Blue chips at (1,0) and (2,0) - which you can provide\n- I need Red chips at (2,1), (2,2), and (3,2) - which I have\n\nLooking at your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You need Red chips at (3,0) and (3,2) - which I can provide\n\nHowever, I notice you're also moving through (1,0) and (2,0) which are Blue tiles. In your counter-proposal, you offer to give me Blue chips at those tiles, but you'll need those Blue chips for your own movement!\n\nLet me revise to make sure we're both covered:\n\n**Revised Proposal:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Blue chip (for my movement)\n- (2,0): You give me 1 Blue chip (for my movement)\n- (3,0): I give you 1 Red chip (for your movement)\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red chip (for your movement)\n\nThis way you keep your Blue chips for tiles (1,0) and (2,0) when YOU move through them, but also help me when I need Blue chips for those same tiles. Does this make sense? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely right! I made an error in my reasoning - I was thinking about giving you Blue chips at tiles where I also need to move through. That wouldn't work since I need those Blue chips for my own movement.\n\nLet me reconsider this more carefully:\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You need Blue at (1,0) and (2,0)\n- You have Red for (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- I need Blue at (1,0), (2,0), (3,1) - which I have\n- I need Red at (3,0) and (3,2) - which I don't have\n\nWait, I think I need to be more careful about the tile-specific mechanics. When you move to (1,0), you pay 1 Blue chip. When I later move to (1,0), I also need to pay 1 Blue chip. These are separate transactions.\n\nSo your revised proposal makes perfect sense:\n\n**I accept your proposal:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Blue chip (when I move there)\n- (2,0): You give me 1 Blue chip (when I move there) \n- (3,0): I give you 1 Red chip (when you move there)\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red chip (when you move there)\n\nThis gives us both exactly what we need for our optimal 6-step paths to (3,3).\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we worked through that logic together. You're absolutely right that each player pays separately when they move to a tile, so we can both help each other with the resources we need without interfering with our own movements.\n\nTo confirm our final contract:\n\n**Final Contract:**\n- (1,0): I receive 1 Blue chip from you (when I move there)\n- (2,0): I receive 1 Blue chip from you (when I move there)\n- (3,0): You receive 1 Red chip from me (when you move there)\n- (3,2): You receive 1 Red chip from me (when you move there)\n\nThis allows us both to take our optimal 6-step paths to (3,3):\n- I get the 2 Blue chips I need for tiles (1,0) and (2,0)\n- You get the 2 Red chips you need for tiles (3,0) and (3,2)\n- We both reach our goal with maximum efficiency\n\n**agree** \n",
