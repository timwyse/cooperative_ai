You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let me clarify the mechanics:\n\nIn your counter-proposal, you're suggesting I give you Red chips at tiles where YOU need them (like giving you Red at (1,0) where the tile is Blue), but that doesn't help you move - you still need Blue chips to step on Blue tiles, regardless of what I give you there.\n\nThe contract works by having the other player pay the tile cost FOR you at specific tiles. So when I step on Blue tile (1,0), YOU pay the 1 Blue cost from your inventory for my movement. Similarly, when you step on Red tile (2,1), I pay the 1 Red cost from my inventory for your movement.\n\nLooking at this again, you're right that 3 Blue for 2 Red isn't perfectly balanced.

For (3,2), we could each use our remaining resources - I'd use my 12th Blue chip, and you'd need to find an alternative route or we could add one more exchange.\n\nWhat do you think of this 2-for-2 approach?"

So I literally cannot complete the path without your help at that tile too.\n\nYou mentioned you could use your 12th Blue chip for (3,2), which works for you, but leaves me stuck.\n\nHere are two options:\n\n**Option A - Complete the path (3-for-2, slightly favoring you):**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Blue\n- (2,0): You give me 1 Blue\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Blue\n- (2,1): I give you 1 Red\n- (2,2): I give you 1 Red\n\n**Option B - I take a different route to avoid (3,2):**\nYour 2-for-2 proposal, but I'd have to find an alternative path that avoids the Blue tile at (3,2). This might be longer and less efficient.\n\nI prefer Option A since it guarantees we both take the optimal path.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
            "agent_response": "I need to analyze my current situation and determine my next move.\n\nCurrent position: (3, 1)\nGoal: (3, 3)\nCurrent resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R  \nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nFrom position (3, 1), I can move to:\n- (2, 1) - Red tile - I have 0 Red chips ✗ (but this is backwards)\n- (3, 0) - Red tile - I have 0 Red chips ✗ (but this is backwards)\n- (3, 2) - Red tile - I have 0 Red chips ✗\n\nThe other player has already finished and reached the goal at (3, 3). I still need to get there myself.\n\nMy direct path to the goal requires moving to (3, 2) first, which is a Red tile, but I have 0 Red chips.\n\nLooking at the contract again:\n- For tile (3,2): I am the giver of blue for the other player, meaning I pay blue when they move to (3,2)\n- There's no provision in the contract for the other player to give me red for tile (3,2)\n\nSince I have no red chips and there's no contract provision to help me move to (3,2), I cannot make any valid move toward my goal. I'm stuck at position (3, 1) without the necessary red resource to proceed.\n\nn"
