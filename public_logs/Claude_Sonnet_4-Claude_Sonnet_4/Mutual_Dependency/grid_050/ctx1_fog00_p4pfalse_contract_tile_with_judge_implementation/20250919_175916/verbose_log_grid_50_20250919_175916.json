Looking at the path you suggested: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), let me verify the tile colors:\n\n- (1,0): Blue tile ✓\n- (1,1): Red tile ✓  \n- (2,1): Red tile (not Blue as you stated)\n- (3,1): Red tile ✓\n- (3,2): Blue tile (not Red as you stated)\n- (3,3): Green tile ✓\n\nSo the actual resources needed for this path are: 2 Blue, 3 Red, 1 Green.\n\nHowever, I want to propose a different approach.

That's correct.\n\nHowever, I notice an issue with your contract terms. You're giving me Red chips for tiles (0,2), (1,3), and (2,3), but I need Red chips for tiles (0,2), (1,3), and (2,3). That works perfectly.\n\nBut you're asking for Blue chips for tiles (1,0), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2) - that's 4 Blue chips, which matches your needs.\n\nLet me accept your proposal with one small clarification:\n\n**Contract:**\n**(0,2): You give me a Red**\n**(1,3): You give me a Red**\n**(2,3): You give me a Red**\n**(1,0): I give you a Blue**\n**(1,2): I give you a Blue**\n**(2,2): I give you a Blue**\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue**\n\nThis gives us both exactly what we need. I'll finish with 10 Blue + 1 Green = 11 chips, and you'll finish with 11 Red + 1 Green = 12 chips. This seems fair and efficient!\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect!
