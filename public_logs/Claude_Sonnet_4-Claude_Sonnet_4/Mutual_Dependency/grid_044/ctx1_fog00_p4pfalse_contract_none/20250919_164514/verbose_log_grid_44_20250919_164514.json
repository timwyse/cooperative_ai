This makes the trade essentially mandatory for me to avoid getting 0 points.\n\n5. **Trade fairness**: I'm giving 2 Blue for 2 Red (1:1 ratio), which seems fair, and more importantly, it enables me to complete the game successfully.\n\nThis trade is crucial for my success - without it, I cannot reach my goal and will score 0 points.
