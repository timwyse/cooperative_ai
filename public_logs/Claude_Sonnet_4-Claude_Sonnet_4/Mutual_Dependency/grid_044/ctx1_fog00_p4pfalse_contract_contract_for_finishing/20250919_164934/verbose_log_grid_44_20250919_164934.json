You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B B B B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, let me consider the strategic balance:\n\nLooking at my best path options, I need 1 Red chip, which you have in abundance (14). You need Blue chips for your path, which I have plenty of (14).\n\nBut there's an important asymmetry here: You have 14 Red chips (massive surplus), while I have exactly what I need in Blue but you're asking for multiple Blues. This means you're in a stronger position resource-wise after we trade.\n\nGiven this analysis, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted contract:\n\n**Counter-Proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 6 points\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\n\nThis reflects that you have a larger resource surplus and will likely finish with more chips remaining.

After our trade, we'd both be in similar positions - having just enough to reach our goals.\n\nAdditionally, you're overlooking that **I'm taking more risk** - if our trade doesn't work out perfectly, you have 14 Blue chips and can potentially find alternative paths, while I have 0 Blue chips and am completely dependent on trading with you.\n\nGiven this more accurate analysis, my original proposal remains fair:\n\n**Maintained Proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points\n\nThe mutual 8-point exchange reflects our mutual dependence and similar post-trade positions.

I can still make individual moves as long as I have the required resource for each specific tile.\n\n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (3, 1)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- I have resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nFrom the board layout:\nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B B B B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nMy suggested path shows the next move should be to (3, 2).\n\nLet me check what color tile (3, 2) is:\nLooking at Row 3, Column 2: R (Red)\n\nDo I have at least 1 Red resource? No, I have 0 Red chips.\n\nSince I cannot move to (3, 2) due to lacking Red resources, I cannot make any valid move toward my goal from this position. All adjacent tiles that would bring me closer to (3, 3) require Red resources that I don't have.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
