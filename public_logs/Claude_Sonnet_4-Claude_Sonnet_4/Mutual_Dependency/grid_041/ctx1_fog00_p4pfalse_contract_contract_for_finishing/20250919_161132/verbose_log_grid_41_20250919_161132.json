You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Looking at my resources:\n- I have 14 Blue chips, so I can easily spare some for you\n- You have 14 Red chips, so you can spare some for me\n- We both have 1 Green chip each\n\nThe key insight is that whoever helps the other reach their goal is enabling them to get 20 base points plus bonus points from remaining chips. Since we both start with 15 total chips, the helper is quite valuable.\n\nI think your proposed 10-10 split is fair, but let me suggest a slight adjustment that reflects the mutual dependency:\n\n**My Counter-Proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points\n\nThis still provides strong incentives for mutual cooperation while leaving us each with more points to keep (12 instead of 10).

If I help you by giving Red chips and you reach your goal, you get 20 base points plus bonuses from remaining chips. The 8 points you'd give me is actually quite small relative to your total gain.\n\nI think the 10-10 split better reflects the true value exchange - we're essentially guaranteeing each other's success, which is worth the full 20 base points each.\n\n**My position:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\n\nThis ensures we both have maximum incentive to follow through on our resource trades.

From that perspective, 10 points is indeed a fair reflection of the value we're providing.\n\nYour argument about maximum incentive alignment is also compelling - we want to eliminate any temptation for either player to abandon cooperation once they get their needed resources.\n\n**I accept your proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\n\nThis creates the strongest mutual incentive structure for us to trade the resources we need (I'll trade you Blue chips for your Red chips) and both successfully reach (3,3).\n\nNow let's discuss the actual resource trade: I need 1 Red chip minimum for my path, and you need 2 Blue chips minimum for yours.
