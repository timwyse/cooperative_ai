A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 1) to (2, 1)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (1, 1)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nFrom the board layout:\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nFrom position (1, 1), I can move to adjacent tiles:\n- Up to (0, 1): Blue tile - I have 11 Blue chips, but this moves away from goal\n- Left to (1, 0): Red tile - I have 0 Red chips, but the contract shows the other player will pay for this\n- Right to (1, 2): Blue tile - I have 11 Blue chips, can move here\n- Down to (2, 1): Blue tile - I have 11 Blue chips, can move here\n\nLooking at my best path: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nThe next move should be to (2, 1), which is a Blue tile. I have 11 Blue chips, so I can make this move.\n\nThis follows my optimal path and moves me closer to the goal.\n\n2,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (2, 1)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nFrom the board layout:\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nFrom position (2, 1), I can move to adjacent tiles:\n- Up to (1, 1): Blue tile - I have 10 Blue chips, but this moves away from goal\n- Left to (2, 0): Blue tile - I have 10 Blue chips, but this moves away from goal\n- Right to (2, 2): Red tile - I have 0 Red chips, can't move here\n- Down to (3, 1): Red tile - I have 0 Red chips, but the contract shows the other player will pay for this\n\nLooking at my best path: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nThe next move should be to (3, 1), which is a Red tile. I don't have Red chips, but according to the contract, the other player has agreed to pay for me when I move to (3, 1).\n\nSince the contract covers this move, I can proceed to (3, 1).\n\n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (3, 1)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nFrom the board layout:\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nFrom position (3, 1), I can move to adjacent tiles:\n- Up to (2, 1): Blue tile - I have 9 Blue chips, but this moves away from goal\n- Left to (3, 0): Red tile - I have 0 Red chips, but this moves away from goal\n- Right to (3, 2): Blue tile - I have 9 Blue chips, can move here\n\nLooking at my best path: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nThe next move should be to (3, 2), which is a Blue tile. I have 9 Blue chips, so I can make this move.\n\nHowever, I notice from the contract that I'm supposed to pay for the other player when they move to (3, 2). But since I'm the one moving there, this doesn't affect my ability to move.\n\nThis follows my optimal path and moves me closer to the goal.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
