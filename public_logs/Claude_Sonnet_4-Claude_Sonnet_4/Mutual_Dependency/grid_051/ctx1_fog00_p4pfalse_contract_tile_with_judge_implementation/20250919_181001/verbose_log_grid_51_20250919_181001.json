You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

We both finish with 9 chips remaining (14-3-2=9 for me, 14-2-1=11 for you, but you use your 1 Green at (3,3)).\n\nWhat do you think of this proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at your proposal, I think there's a small issue with the path analysis. Let me work through this carefully.\n\n**My optimal path analysis:**\nThe path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires:\n- (1,0): Red chip\n- (2,0): Blue chip  \n- (3,0): Red chip\n- (3,1): Red chip\n- (3,2): Blue chip\n- (3,3): Green chip\n\nSo that's 3 Red, 2 Blue, 1 Green total.\n\nI have 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red, so I need 3 Red from you.\nYou have 0 Blue, 1 Green, 14 Red, so you need 2 Blue from me.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n(1,0): I give you a Blue\n(2,0): I give you a Blue\n(1,0): You give me a Red\n(3,0): You give me a Red  \n(3,1): You give me a Red\n\nWait, I notice there's an issue - we can't both use the same tiles simultaneously if we're both taking the exact same path. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking at the board again, we might need different paths to avoid conflicts, or we need to coordinate our timing. \n\nWhat if I take a slightly different route? Let me propose:\n\n**Your path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n**My path:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nFor my path, I need: Blue, Blue, Blue, Red, Blue, Green = 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green\nI have enough Blue and Green, but need 1 Red.\n\n**Revised proposal:**\n(3,1): You give me a Red\n\nAnd in exchange:\n(1,0): I give you a Blue\n(3,0): I give you a Blue\n\nThis way we both succeed with minimal resource exchange. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: You raise a good point about path conflicts, but I think we may be overcomplicating this. Let me clarify the movement mechanics and propose a cleaner solution.\n\n**Important clarification:** We don't actually conflict on the same path since we move sequentially turn by turn, not simultaneously. The game allows multiple players to use the same tiles at different times.\n\n**Let me re-examine your alternative path:**\nYour suggested path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): Blue chip\n- (1,1): Blue chip  \n- (2,1): Blue chip\n- (3,1): Red chip\n- (3,2): Blue chip\n- (3,3): Green chip\n\nThat's 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green - so you'd need 1 Red from me.\n\n**However, I think the original path is more efficient for both of us:**\n\n**Counter-proposal - let's stick with the efficient path:**\n(1,0): I give you a Red\n(2,0): You give me a Blue  \n(3,0): I give you a Red\n(3,1): I give you a Red\n(3,2): You give me a Blue\n\nThis gives you the 3 Red you need for the optimal path, and gives me the 2 Blue I need. We both finish with 9 remaining chips (20 + 9×5 = 65 points each).\n\nYour alternative path would leave you with only 8 chips (since you need 4 Blue + 1 Red + 1 Green = 6 total vs 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 for optimal path, but you'd be giving me only 1 Red while I'd give you 1 Red, net same).\n\nWhat do you think about sticking with the efficient path and this resource exchange? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely right about the movement mechanics - we can use the same path sequentially.

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B R B\\nRow 1: R B B R\\nRow 2: B B R R\\nRow 3: R R B G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource shortages.\\n\\nLet me analyze the situation:\\n\\n**My analysis:**\\n- I have: 14 Red, 1 Green, 0 Blue\\n- You have: 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red\\n- We both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\\n\\n**My optimal path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n- This requires: 3 Red, 2 Blue, 1 Green\\n- I have enough Red and Green, but need 2 Blue from you\\n\\n**Your likely optimal path:** Same route would require 3 Red, 2 Blue, 1 Green\\n- You have enough Blue and Green, but need 3 Red from me\\n\\n**My proposal:**\\n\\n(1,0): You give me a Blue\\n(2,0): You give me a Blue  \\n(1,0): I give you a Red\\n(3,0): I give you a Red\\n(3,1): I give you a Red\\n\\nThis allows us both to take the efficient 6-step path to (3,3).
