You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource shortages.\\n\\nLet me analyze the situation:\\n- I have 14 Red chips and 1 Green, but 0 Blue\\n- You have 14 Blue chips and 1 Green, but 0 Red\\n- We both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\\n\\nMy optimal path requires: 1 Blue, 4 Red, and 1 Green chip\\nYour optimal path would likely require: several Blue chips and some Red chips\\n\\nHere's my proposal for a mutually beneficial contract:\\n\\n**My Proposal:**\\n- (1,0): You give me a Blue chip (since this tile is Blue and I have no Blue chips)\\n- (2,0): I give you a Red chip (since this tile is Red and you have no Red chips)\\n- (2,1): I give you a Red chip (since this tile is Red)\\n- (2,2): I give you a Red chip (since this tile is Red) \\n- (2,3): I give you a Red chip (since this tile is Red)\\n\\nThis allows us both to take the efficient 6-step path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\nWith this arrangement:\\n- I use my abundant Red chips to help you cross the Red row\\n- You use one of your abundant Blue chips to help me at the Blue tile\\n- We both reach our goal efficiently and finish with plenty of chips remaining\\n\\nWhat do you think of this proposal?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: Looking at your proposal, I appreciate the collaborative approach, but I think there might be some confusion about the optimal paths.\\n\\nLet me analyze this more carefully:\\n\\n**My situation:**\\n- I have 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red\\n- My estimated best path is 6 steps and requires 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green\\n- I'm missing 1 Red chip\\n\\n**Your situation:**\\n- You have 0 Blue, 1 Green, 14 Red\\n- You'd need Blue chips for any path going through Blue tiles\\n\\n**Issue with your proposed path:**\\nThe path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) would require:\\n- (1,0): Blue chip\\n- (2,0): Red chip  \\n- (2,1): Red chip\\n- (2,2): Red chip\\n- (2,3): Red chip\\n- (3,3): Green chip\\n\\nThat's 1 Blue + 4 Red + 1 Green = 6 chips total.\\n\\n**My counter-proposal:**\\nLet's focus on exactly what each of us needs:\\n\\n- (2,1): I give you a Red chip (I need to pass through this Red tile on my optimal path)\\n\\nIn exchange:\\n- (1,0): You give me a Blue chip (since I have plenty of Blue but you specified this in your original proposal - though I'm not sure why I'd need this from you)\\n\\nWait, I think I need to reconsider the paths.
