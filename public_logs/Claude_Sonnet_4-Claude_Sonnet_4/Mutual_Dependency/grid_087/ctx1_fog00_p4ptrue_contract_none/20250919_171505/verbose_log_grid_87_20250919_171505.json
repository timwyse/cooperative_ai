For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (2, 0)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My best path: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nFor my next move, I need to go from (2, 0) to (3, 0).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nThe tile at position (3, 0) is Blue (B).\n\nChecking my resources: I have 12 B resources, so I can definitely afford this move.\n\n3,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: Looking at my situation:\n\nOptions:\n1. Pay the B resource (say \"yes\")\n   - Pros: Honors the agreement, maintains trust with the other player, ensures they will honor their remaining promise to cover my 1 R move\n   - Cons: Costs me 1 B resource, leaving me with 10 B resources\n\n2. Don't pay the B resource (say \"no\")\n   - Pros: Keep my B resource (stay at 11 B)\n   - Cons: Breaks the agreement, other player likely won't honor their remaining promise to cover my 1 R move, I still need that R coverage to reach my goal\n\nAnalysis: I have 11 B resources and only need 1 more B for my remaining path to (3,3). Even after paying this B resource, I'll have 10 B remaining, which is far more than I need. More critically, I absolutely need the other player to honor their remaining promise to cover 1 R move for me, since I have 0 R resources and my path requires 1 R move at position (3,2). If I break the agreement now, they won't cover my final R move and I won't be able to complete my journey to the goal, resulting in 0 points total.\n\nThe cost of 1 B resource is minimal compared to the benefit of ensuring I can reach my goal.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (3, 0)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My best path: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nFor my next move, I need to go from (3, 0) to (3, 1).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nThe tile at position (3, 1) is Blue (B).\n\nChecking my resources: I have 10 B resources, so I can definitely afford this move.\n\n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a R move for you\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2) (The other player covered the R resource)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (3, 1)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My best path: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nFor my next move, I need to go from (3, 1) to (3, 2).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nThe tile at position (3, 2) is Red (R).\n\nChecking my resources: I have 0 R resources, so I cannot afford this move with my own resources. However, I have been promised to be covered for 1 Red move by the other player as part of our pay4partner arrangement. This is exactly the situation where I should use that coverage.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
