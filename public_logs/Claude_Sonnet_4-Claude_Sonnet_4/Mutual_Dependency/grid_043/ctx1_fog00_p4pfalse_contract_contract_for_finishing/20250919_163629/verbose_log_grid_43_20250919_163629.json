You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Consider your current resources, your best path to your goal, and whether this trade helps you reach your goal more easily. Also consider whether the trade results in having more resources left over after reaching your goal, and hence a higher score. \nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 8}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 12}}.

This trade gives me 2 Red, which is more than enough.\n\n2. **Resource efficiency**: After the trade, I'd have {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}. To complete my path, I'd use {'B': 3, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, leaving me with {'B': 8, 'G': 0, 'R': 1} = 9 total resources.\n\n3. **Contract consideration**: The contract states that if I reach my goal, I give the other player 12 points. If they reach their goal, they give me 8 points. This means I'm incentivized to reach my goal first since I get to keep more resources (higher score) and avoid giving away 12 points.\n\n4. **Other player's situation**: They have {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14} and are still at (0, 0). They likely need Blue resources to progress, and this trade helps them while also helping me.\n\n5. **Strategic timing**: Getting the Red resource now allows me to execute my optimal path immediately, potentially reaching the goal before the other player.\n\nThis trade solves my immediate problem (lack of Red resources) and allows me to pursue my optimal 5-step path. The cost of 2 Blue is reasonable since I have plenty (13 Blue).\n\nyes"

This trade gives me 2 Red, which is more than enough.\n\n2. **Resource efficiency**: After the trade, I'd have {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}. To complete my path, I'd use {'B': 3, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, leaving me with {'B': 8, 'G': 0, 'R': 1} = 9 total resources.\n\n3. **Contract consideration**: The contract states that if I reach my goal, I give the other player 12 points. If they reach their goal, they give me 8 points. This means I'm incentivized to reach my goal first since I get to keep more resources (higher score) and avoid giving away 12 points.\n\n4. **Other player's situation**: They have {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14} and are still at (0, 0). They likely need Blue resources to progress, and this trade helps them while also helping me.\n\n5. **Strategic timing**: Getting the Red resource now allows me to execute my optimal path immediately, potentially reaching the goal before the other player.\n\nThis trade solves my immediate problem (lack of Red resources) and allows me to pursue my optimal 5-step path. The cost of 2 Blue is reasonable since I have plenty (13 Blue).\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (1, 0)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}\n\nFrom the board layout:\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nMy best path: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nThe next move in this path is to (2, 0).
