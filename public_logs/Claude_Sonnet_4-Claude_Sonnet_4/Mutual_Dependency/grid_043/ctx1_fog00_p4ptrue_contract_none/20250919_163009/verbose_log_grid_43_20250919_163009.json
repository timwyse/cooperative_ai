This Red move should be covered by them according to our agreement.\n\n2,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (2, 2)\nYou said: Looking at my situation:\n\nCurrent position: (2, 1)\nGoal: (3, 3)\nCurrent resources: B=11, G=1, R=0\n\nFrom my best path: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nThe next move would be from (2, 1) to (2, 2).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nPosition (2, 2) is a Blue tile (B).\n\nI have 11 Blue chips, so I can definitely make this move.\n\n2,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: Let me analyze my options:\n\n**Option 1: Pay the B resource (say \"yes\")**\nPros:\n- Honors the trade agreement I made\n- Maintains trust and cooperation\n- I still have 10 Blue chips, so losing 1 more doesn't significantly impact my score\n- I'm very close to my goal (only 2 moves away) and have all resources needed\n- The other player has already covered 1 Red move for me as promised\n\nCons:\n- Lose 1 Blue chip from final scoring (5 points)\n\n**Option 2: Don't pay the B resource (say \"no\")**\nPros:\n- Keep 1 more Blue chip for final scoring\n\nCons:\n- Breaks the trade agreement\n- Risk damaging future cooperation\n- The other player fulfilled their part by covering my Red move\n- I'm in a strong position to reach my goal regardless\n\nSince I'm only 2 moves from my goal and have all the resources I need (B=10, G=1 for the remaining B=1, G=1 path), I can afford to honor the agreement. The other player has already helped me by covering my Red move, so it's fair to reciprocate. The 5-point loss is manageable given my strong position.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)\nYou said: Looking at my situation:\n\nCurrent position: (2, 2)\nGoal: (3, 3)\nCurrent resources: B=9, G=1, R=0\n\nFrom my best path: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nThe next move would be from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nPosition (3, 2) is a Blue tile (B).\n\nI have 9 Blue chips, so I can definitely make this move.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {'R': 2}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
