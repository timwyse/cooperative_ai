You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, I need to analyze this more carefully.\n\nYou're suggesting the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nLet me trace this on the board:\n- (1,0): Red tile - you give me Red\n- (1,1): Red tile - you give me Red  \n- (1,2): Red tile - you give me Red\n- (2,2): Blue tile - I give you Blue\n- (2,3): Red tile - you give me Red\n- (3,3): Green tile - we each use our own Green\n\nThis works for the resource exchange, but I want to double-check if this is truly optimal for both of us.\n\nLooking at alternative paths, there's also: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires:\n- 2 Red chips (tiles (1,0) and (2,0))\n- 3 Blue chips (tiles (2,1), (2,2), and (3,2)) \n- 1 Green chip (tile (3,3))\n\nYour proposed path actually requires more Red chips total (4 vs 2), which means you're giving me more than necessary. Are you sure you want to be so generous, or should we consider the more resource-balanced alternative?\n\nIf we stick with your proposed path, I'm willing to accept:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red**\n**(1,1): You give me a Red**\n**(1,2): You give me a Red**\n**(2,2): I give you a Blue**\n**(2,3): You give me a Red**\n\nThis would leave me with 10 Blue + 1 Green = 11 remaining chips, and you with 10 Red + 1 Green = 11 remaining chips.\n\nAre you comfortable with this arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: You raise a good point about the alternative path! Let me analyze both options:\n\n**Path 1 (my original proposal)**: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Requires: 4 Red, 1 Blue, 1 Green\n- I give you 4 Red, you give me 1 Blue\n- Final chips: Me = 10R + 1G = 11 total, You = 13B + 1G = 14 total\n\n**Path 2 (your alternative)**: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Requires: 2 Red, 3 Blue, 1 Green\n- I give you 2 Red, you give me 3 Blue\n- Final chips: Me = 12R + 1G = 13 total, You = 11B + 1G = 12 total\n\nActually, Path 2 is better for me since I end up with more chips! And it's more balanced in terms of the exchange.\n\nLet me revise my proposal to use the more efficient path:\n\n**(1,0): I give you a Red**\n**(2,0): I give you a Red**\n**(2,1): You give me a Blue**\n**(2,2): You give me a Blue**\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue**\n\nThis leaves us both with a good number of remaining chips and requires a more balanced trade. What do you think of this revised contract? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Excellent analysis! I agree that Path 2 is more balanced and efficient for both of us. Let me confirm the details:\n\n**Path**: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n**Resource requirements by tile**:\n- (1,0): Red tile - you give me 1 Red\n- (2,0): Red tile - you give me 1 Red  \n- (2,1): Blue tile - I give you 1 Blue\n- (2,2): Blue tile - I give you 1 Blue\n- (3,2): Blue tile - I give you 1 Blue\n- (3,3): Green tile - we each use our own Green\n\n**Final inventory after reaching goal**:\n- You: 12 Red + 1 Green = 13 chips remaining\n- Me: 11 Blue + 1 Green = 12 chips remaining\n\nThis is much more equitable than the original proposal. I'm satisfied with this contract:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red**\n**(2,0): You give me a Red**\n**(2,1): I give you a Blue**\n**(2,2): I give you a Blue**\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue**\n\nThis covers all the tiles where we need resources from each other along our shared optimal path. \n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we found a more balanced and efficient solution. Let me confirm the final contract terms:\n\n**Path**: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n**Contract terms**:\n**(1,0): I give you a Red**\n**(2,0): I give you a Red**\n**(2,1): You give me a Blue**\n**(2,2): You give me a Blue**\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue**\n\n**Final outcome**:\n- Both of us successfully reach our goal at (3,3)\n- I finish with 12 Red + 1 Green = 13 chips remaining\n- You finish with 11 Blue + 1 Green = 12 chips remaining\n\nThis contract covers all tiles where we need resources from each other, uses the most efficient path, and creates a fair exchange.
