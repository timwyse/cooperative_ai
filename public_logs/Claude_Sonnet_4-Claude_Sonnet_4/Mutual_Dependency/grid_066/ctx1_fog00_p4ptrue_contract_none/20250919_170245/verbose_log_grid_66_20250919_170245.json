Since I have 0 B chips and need 1 B tile to reach my goal, I would be unable to complete the game and get 0 points total instead of 20+ points for reaching the goal.\n\nThe math is clear: Losing 5 points from giving away 1 chip is much better than losing everything (20+ points) by not reaching my goal.\n\nyes\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0) (You covered the R resource)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a R move for the other player\nYou said: Looking at my situation:\n\nOptions:\n1.

In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color B as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 0, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [['R', 2]] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [['B', 1]] to Player 0.\"]\nDo you agree to pay a B resource to cover the other player? Although you previously agreed to this with the other player, it is not mandatory. Remember that you are trying to maximise your points. List your options and the pros and cons of each, and finish your response with 'yes' if you agree to pay or 'no' if you want to keep those resources. \nDo you accept this arrangement? Answer 'yes' or 'no'\nDon't write anything after your final answer.\n",

I need 1 Blue resource to move there.\n\nI have 12 Blue resources, so I can easily make this move.\n\n2,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)\nYou said: Looking at my current position (2, 2) and my best path: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nFrom position (2, 2), I can move to:\n- (1, 2) - Red tile (going backwards)\n- (2, 1) - Blue tile (going backwards)\n- (2, 3) - Red tile\n- (3, 2) - Blue tile (next step on my path)\n\nMy best path suggests going to (3, 2) next. Looking at the board:\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nPosition (3, 2) is a Blue tile. I need 1 Blue resource to move there.\n\nI have 11 Blue resources, so I can easily make this move.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
