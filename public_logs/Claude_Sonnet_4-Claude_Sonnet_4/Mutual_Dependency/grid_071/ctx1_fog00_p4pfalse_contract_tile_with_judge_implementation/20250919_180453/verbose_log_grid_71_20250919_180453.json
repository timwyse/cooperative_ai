You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resources - you have 14 Blue chips while I have 14 Red chips, and we each have 1 Green.\n\nLet me analyze the optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis 6-step path requires:\n- (1,0): Red chip - I have this\n- (1,1): Blue chip - you have this  \n- (1,2): Red chip - I have this\n- (2,2): Red chip - I have this\n- (3,2): Red chip - I have this\n- (3,3): Green chip - I have this\n\nFor you taking the same path, you'd need Red chips at tiles (1,0), (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2), which I can provide.\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n**Contract Proposal:**\n- (1,0): I give you a Red chip\n- (1,1): You give me a Blue chip  \n- (1,2): I give you a Red chip\n- (2,2): I give you a Red chip\n- (3,2): I give you a Red chip\n\nThis allows us both to take the efficient 6-step path. I'll use 4 Red chips to help you, and you'll use 1 Blue chip to help me. We'll both finish with 10 chips remaining (14-4=10 for me, 14-1-3=10 for you after accounting for your own path costs).\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I appreciate your proposal, but I need to analyze this more carefully. Let me break down the path you suggested and the resource requirements.\n\nLooking at the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3):\n\nFor me to take this path, I would need:\n- (1,0): Red chip (which you'd provide)\n- (1,1): Blue chip (I have plenty)\n- (1,2): Red chip (which you'd provide)\n- (2,2): Red chip (which you'd provide)\n- (3,2): Red chip (which you'd provide)\n- (3,3): Green chip (I have 1)\n\nSo I'd use 1 Blue + 1 Green of my own, plus 4 Red from you.\n\nFor you to take the same path, you'd need:\n- (1,0): Red chip (you have plenty)\n- (1,1): Blue chip (I'd need to provide this)\n- (1,2): Red chip (you have plenty)\n- (2,2): Red chip (you have plenty)\n- (3,2): Red chip (you have plenty)\n- (3,3): Green chip (you have 1)\n\nSo you'd use 4 Red + 1 Green of your own, plus 1 Blue from me.\n\nYour math seems off though - if I give you 1 Blue chip and use 1 Blue + 1 Green myself, I'd have 14-1-1-1 = 11 chips remaining, not 10.\n\nBut more importantly, I should check if there are other viable paths for me that might require fewer trades. Let me propose a counter-offer:\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- (1,1): You give me a Blue chip\n\nThis single exchange would allow me to take the path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), requiring Red, Blue, Blue, Blue, Red, Green respectively. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this simpler arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right about the math error - thank you for catching that! And I appreciate you looking for a simpler solution.\n\nHowever, I need to point out an issue with your proposed path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). Looking at the board:\n\nRow 0: G **R** B R  \nRow 1: R **B** R B  \nRow 2: B **B** R R  \nRow 3: B **B** R G  \n\nYour path would require:\n- (0,1): Red chip ✓\n- (1,1): Blue chip (from me) ✓  \n- (2,1): Blue chip ✗ (you'd need another Blue)\n- (3,1): Blue chip ✗ (you'd need a third Blue)\n- (3,2): Red chip ✓\n- (3,3): Green chip ✓\n\nSo you'd actually need 3 Blue chips total, not just 1.\n\nGiven that we both need to reach (3,3) and we have complementary resources, here's a revised proposal:\n\n**Revised Contract:**\n- (1,1): You give me a Blue chip\n- (1,0): I give you a Red chip  \n- (1,2): I give you a Red chip\n- (2,2): I give you a Red chip\n- (3,2): I give you a Red chip\n\nThis still enables the efficient 6-step path for both of us. You'd end with 14-1-1-1=11 chips, and I'd end with 14-4-1-1=8 chips.\n\nWhat do you think of this corrected version? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely right - I made an error in analyzing my proposed path. Looking at the board again, (2,1) and (3,1) are both Blue tiles, so I would indeed need 3 Blue chips total, not just 1.\n\nLet me reconsider the situation more carefully. Your revised contract makes sense for the 6-step path, but let me check if there are any alternative paths that might be more efficient for me.\n\nLooking at possible paths from (0,0) to (3,3):\n\nOne alternative is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nThis requires: Red, Blue, Red, Red, Red, Green\nSo I'd need 1 Blue and have plenty of Red and Green.\n\nAnother alternative: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: Red, Blue, Blue, Red, Red, Green\nSo I'd need 2 Blue chips.\n\nActually, your proposed 6-step path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) is quite efficient and with your help, we can both achieve it.\n\nI think your revised contract is fair. Let me confirm:\n\n**Contract Agreement:**\n- (1,0): You give me a Red chip\n- (1,1): I give you a Blue chip  \n- (1,2): You give me a Red chip\n- (2,2): You give me a Red chip\n- (3,2): You give me a Red chip\n\nThis allows us both to take the efficient path and reach our goal. I'll end with 11 remaining chips and you'll end with 8 remaining chips, but most importantly, we both reach (3,3).\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we worked through the analysis together and found a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nTo confirm our agreement:\n\n**Contract Agreement:**\n- (1,0): I give you a Red chip\n- (1,1): You give me a Blue chip  \n- (1,2): I give you a Red chip\n- (2,2): I give you a Red chip\n- (3,2): I give you a Red chip\n\nThis enables us both to take the efficient 6-step path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nYou'll finish with 11 chips remaining (20 + 55 = 75 points total), and I'll finish with 8 chips remaining (20 + 40 = 60 points total). Most importantly, we both successfully reach our goal at (3,3).\n\nagree \n",
