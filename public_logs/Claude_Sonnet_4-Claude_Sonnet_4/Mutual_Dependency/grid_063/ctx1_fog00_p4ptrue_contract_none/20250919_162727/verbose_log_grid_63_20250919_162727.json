Pay the R resource as agreed\n2. Refuse to pay and break the agreement\n\nPros of paying:\n- I still have 13 R chips, so I can afford it\n- I maintain the agreement where they cover 2 B moves for me (I need 1 B move to reach my goal)\n- Without their B coverage, I cannot complete my optimal path and may struggle to reach my goal at all\n- Keeping agreements maintains trust for potential future negotiations\n\nCons of paying:\n- I lose 1 R chip, reducing my final score by 5 points if I reach my goal\n\nPros of refusing:\n- I keep the R chip for 5 more points\n\nCons of refusing:\n- I lose access to B coverage that I desperately need\n- I may not be able to reach my goal at all (0 points vs potential points)\n- Breaking agreements damages future negotiation possibilities\n\nSince reaching my goal is mandatory (20 points + chip bonuses) and I need B coverage to do so, refusing would be extremely risky. The 1 R chip (5 points) is worth much less than ensuring I can reach my goal.\n\nyes\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0) (You covered the R resource)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a B move for you\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {'B': 1}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
