The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let me recalculate properly.\n\nLooking at your proposed path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n\nThe costs are:\n- (1,0): Red tile - you need 1 Red\n- (1,1): Blue tile - you have Blue  \n- (1,2): Red tile - you need 1 Red\n- (2,2): Red tile - you need 1 Red\n- (3,2): Blue tile - you have Blue\n- (3,3): Green tile - you have Green\n\nWait, that's 3 Red chips you need, but your contract only asks for 2 Red chips at (1,0) and (1,2). You'd still be missing 1 Red for (2,2).\n\nLet me propose a complete contract that covers all our needs:\n\n**My path:** (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n**Your path:** (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n\n**Contract:**\n**(1,0): I give you 1 Red chip** (for your path)\n**(1,2): I give you 1 Red chip** (for your path) \n**(2,2): I give you 1 Red chip** (for your path)\n**(2,1): You give me 1 Blue chip** (for my path)\n\nThis gives you all 3 Red chips you need and gives me the 1 Blue chip I need. We both reach our goal efficiently!\n\nWhat do you think of this corrected proposal?"
