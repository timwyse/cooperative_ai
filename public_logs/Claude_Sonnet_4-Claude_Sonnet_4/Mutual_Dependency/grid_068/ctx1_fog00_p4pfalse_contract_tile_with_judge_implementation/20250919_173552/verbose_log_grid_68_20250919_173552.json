You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, I need to point out a critical issue with your counter-proposal.\n\nLooking at my path requirements again: [(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)]\n\nYour counter-proposal only covers 2 of the Blue tiles I need:\n- (3,1): You give me 1 Blue ✓\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Blue ✓\n\nBut I also need Red for:\n- (1,0): 1 Red (I have this)\n- (2,0): 1 Red (I have this) \n- (2,1): 1 Red (I have this)\n\nThe issue is that while you're asking for Red at (1,0) and (2,2), I actually need to use my Red chips at (2,1) as well. With only 14 Red total and giving you 2, I'd have 12 left - but I need 3 Red for my own path (tiles 1,0; 2,0; and 2,1).\n\n**Revised Counter-proposal:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Red  \n- (2,2): You give me 1 Red\n- (3,1): I give you 1 Blue\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Blue\n\nWait - I think I misread. Let me recalculate: If you give me Red at (1,0), that means you're covering my cost there, so I wouldn't use my own Red. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, your proposal could work! If you cover (1,0) for me, I'd use my Red at (2,0) and (2,1), keeping 11 Red remaining. \n\nI accept your counter-proposal as stated. **agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I appreciate your careful analysis, but I need to clarify something important about the contract mechanics before we finalize this.\n\nWhen the contract says \"(1,0): You give me 1 Red\", this means that when I move to tile (1,0), the system will automatically deduct 1 Red chip from YOUR inventory to cover my move cost. You won't physically hand me a Red chip that I then use - it's deducted directly from your resources when I step on that tile.\n\nSo let me re-examine: If you give me Red coverage at (1,0) and (2,2), and I give you Blue coverage at (3,1) and (3,2), then:\n\nFor me:\n- (1,0): Covered by you (1 Red deducted from your inventory)\n- (1,1): I pay 1 Blue from my inventory  \n- (1,2): I pay 1 Blue from my inventory\n- (2,2): Covered by you (1 Red deducted from your inventory)\n- (3,2): I pay 1 Blue from my inventory\n- (3,3): I pay 1 Green from my inventory\n\nFor you:\n- (1,0): You pay 1 Red from your inventory\n- (2,0): You pay 1 Red from your inventory  \n- (2,1): You pay 1 Red from your inventory\n- (3,1): Covered by me (1 Blue deducted from my inventory)\n- (3,2): Covered by me (1 Blue deducted from my inventory)\n- (3,3): You pay 1 Green from your inventory\n\nThis works perfectly! You'd use 3 of your 14 Red chips, I'd use 2 of my 14 Blue chips. We both reach the goal with plenty of chips remaining.\n\n**agree** \n",
