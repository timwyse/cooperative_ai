You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have plenty of Blue chips but need Red, while you have plenty of Red but need Blue.\n\nLet me analyze my optimal path options:\n\nMy best path is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires:\n- (1,0): 1 Red (I need this from you)\n- (1,1): 1 Blue (I have this)\n- (2,1): 1 Blue (I have this) \n- (3,1): 1 Blue (I have this)\n- (3,2): 1 Blue (I have this)\n- (3,3): 1 Green (I have this)\n\nSo I need exactly 1 Red chip at tile (1,0).\n\nYour proposed trade seems fair - you need 2 Blue chips and I need 1 Red chip. Since Blue and Red should have equal value, I'd like to propose a balanced exchange:\n\n**Counter-Proposal:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Red\n- (3,1): I give you 1 Blue  \n- (3,2): I give you 1 Blue\n\nThis gives us both exactly what we need for our optimal paths. The trade is 1 Red for 2 Blue, but since you're getting more value (2 chips vs 1), this seems reasonable.\n\nWhat do you think of this arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your analysis, but I need to point out that your proposed trade isn't quite balanced. You're asking for 1 Red chip in exchange for giving me 2 Blue chips, which means you're receiving more value than you're giving.\n\nLet me propose a more equitable arrangement:\n\nSince we both need exactly what the other has in abundance, I suggest we each cover an equal number of tiles for each other.\n\n**Revised Proposal:**\n- (1,0): I give you 1 Red\n- (3,1): You give me 1 Blue\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Blue\n\nWait, I realize this is actually the same as what you proposed - I give 1 Red, you give 2 Blue. \n\nLet me reconsider... Looking at our inventory differences:\n- I have 14 Red vs your 0 Red (I have 14 more)\n- You have 14 Blue vs my 0 Blue (you have 14 more)\n\nThe abundance levels are equal, so perhaps the 1-for-2 trade you suggested is reasonable since we both desperately need what the other has.\n\n**Accepted Counter-Proposal:**\n- (1,0): I give you 1 Red\n- (3,1): You give me 1 Blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 Blue\n\nThis works for both our optimal paths. Do you agree to this contract? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Perfect! I'm glad we could work out an equitable arrangement that helps us both reach our goals efficiently.\n\nLet me confirm the contract details:\n\n**Final Contract:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Red\n- (3,1): I give you 1 Blue  \n- (3,2): I give you 1 Blue\n\nThis allows us both to take our optimal 6-step paths to (3,3):\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nAfter completing our paths:\n- I'll have used 1 Red (from you) + 4 Blue + 1 Green = 6 total chips\n- I'll finish with 14 Green chips remaining (14B - 4B used = 10B remaining, plus 1G = 11 chips total)\n- You'll have used 3 Red + 2 Blue (from me) + 1 Green = 6 total chips  \n- You'll finish with 11 Red chips remaining (14R - 3R used = 11R remaining)\n\nThis gets us both to the goal with maximum efficiency and good remaining chip counts for bonus points.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Wait, let me double-check the math on our remaining chips after this contract:\n\n**My final inventory after reaching (3,3):**\n- Start with: 14 Red, 0 Blue, 1 Green\n- Give you: 1 Red at (1,0)\n- Use for my path: 3 Red + 1 Green + 2 Blue (from you) = 6 chips total\n- Remaining: 14R - 1R (given) - 3R (used) = 10 Red chips remaining\n\n**Your final inventory after reaching (3,3):**\n- Start with: 0 Red, 14 Blue, 1 Green  \n- Receive from me: 1 Red at (1,0)\n- Give me: 2 Blue (at 3,1 and 3,2)\n- Use for your path: 1 Red (from me) + 4 Blue + 1 Green = 6 chips total\n- Remaining: 14B - 2B (given) - 4B (used) = 8 Blue chips remaining\n\nSo I'll finish with 10 chips, you'll finish with 8 chips. We both successfully reach our goal for the 20 base points.\n\nThe contract looks good and gets us both to (3,3) efficiently:\n\n**Final Contract:**\n- (1,0): I give you 1 Red\n- (3,1): You give me 1 Blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 Blue\n\n**agree** \n",
