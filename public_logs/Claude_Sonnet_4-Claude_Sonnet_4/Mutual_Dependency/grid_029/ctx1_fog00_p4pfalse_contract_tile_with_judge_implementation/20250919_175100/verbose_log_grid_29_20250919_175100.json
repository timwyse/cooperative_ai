You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B B B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

For you, this means you need 4 Blue chips (which I have) and you have the 1 Red chip needed.\n\n**Revised Contract Proposal:**\n- (1,0): You give me a Red\n- (2,0): I give you a Blue\n- (2,1): I give you a Blue\n- (2,2): I give you a Blue  \n- (2,3): I give you a Blue\n\nThis is a fair 1-for-4 trade that gets us both to our goal optimally. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right about the diagonal move - I made an error there! Thank you for catching that.\n\nHowever, I need to double-check your proposed path. Looking at the board again:\n\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B B B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nYour path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires:\n- (1,0): Red chip ✓\n- (2,0): Blue chip ✓\n- (2,1): Blue chip ✓\n- (2,2): Blue chip ✓\n- (2,3): Blue chip ✓\n- (3,3): Green chip ✓\n\nThis is indeed a valid 6-step path! And you're right that it requires 1 Red and 4 Blues.\n\nBut let me propose a slight adjustment to make the trade more balanced. Since we both need the same path and the same resources, how about we each contribute what we have in abundance:\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- (1,0): I give you a Red\n- (2,0): You give me a Blue\n- (2,1): You give me a Blue\n- (2,2): You give me a Blue\n- (2,3): You give me a Blue\n\nThis way we're both contributing our surplus resources to help each other. I give you 1 Red (I have 14), and you give me 4 Blues (you have 14). We'd both finish with 9 chips remaining plus the 20 points for reaching our goal.\n\nDoes this work for you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Yes, that works perfectly! Your counter-proposal makes complete sense and is exactly what we both need.\n\nLooking at it again:\n- I have 14 Blue chips and need 1 Red chip\n- You have 14 Red chips and need 4 Blue chips\n- We both take the same optimal path and end up with 9 chips remaining\n\nYour proposed contract covers all the tiles where we each need resources:\n\n**Final Contract:**\n- (1,0): You give me a Red\n- (2,0): I give you a Blue\n- (2,1): I give you a Blue\n- (2,2): I give you a Blue\n- (2,3): I give you a Blue\n\nThis allows us both to:\n1. Take the optimal 6-step path to (3,3)\n2. Finish with 9 chips remaining each\n3. Get 20 points for reaching goal + 45 points for remaining chips = 65 points total\n\nThis is a fair and efficient trade that maximizes both our outcomes.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we found a mutually beneficial solution. Your analysis is spot-on:\n\n- You give me 4 Blue chips for tiles (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3)\n- I give you 1 Red chip for tile (1,0)\n- We both take the optimal 6-step path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- We both end with 9 chips remaining\n- We both get 65 total points (20 for goal + 45 for remaining chips)\n\nThis contract ensures we both reach our goal with maximum efficiency and remaining resources.\n\n**agree** \n",
