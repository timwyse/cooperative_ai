You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource shortages.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n- I have 14 Red chips but 0 Blue chips\n- You have 14 Blue chips but 0 Red chips\n- My optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- This requires: 3 Red + 2 Blue + 1 Green\n\n**My Proposal:**\n\nI'll cover your Red chip costs, and you cover my Blue chip costs:\n\n**(1,0): I give you a Red** (you need this for your move)\n**(2,0): I give you a Red** (you need this for your move)  \n**(3,0): I give you a Red** (you need this for your move)\n**(3,1): You give me a Blue** (I need this for my move)\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue** (I need this for my move)\n\nThis way we both can take the efficient 6-step path to our goal. I'll end with 11 Red + 1 Green = 12 chips total, and you'll end with 12 Blue + 1 Green = 13 chips total.\n\nWhat do you think? This seems like a mutually beneficial arrangement since we each have exactly what the other needs. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Looking at your proposal, I appreciate the collaborative approach! However, I need to carefully analyze the paths and resource requirements.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n- Your proposed path for me: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Looking at the board, this path requires: R, R, R, B, B, G\n- I have: 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red\n\n**Issue with your proposal:**\nYour path has me moving through three consecutive Red tiles (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0), but you're only giving me Red chips at those exact tiles. However, I also need Red chips to move TO those tiles in the first place.\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\nLet me suggest a slightly different approach. I'll take the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires: R, B, R, B, B, G\n\n**My proposed contract:**\n**(1,0): You give me a Red** (I need this to move from (0,0) to (1,0))\n**(2,1): You give me a Red** (I need this to move from (1,1) to (2,1))\n**(1,1): I give you a Blue** (you need this for your move)\n**(3,1): I give you a Blue** (you need this for your move)\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue** (you need this for your move)\n\nThis gives us both viable 6-step paths. I'd end with 12 Blue + 1 Green = 13 chips, and you'd end with 12 Red + 1 Green = 13 chips total.\n\nWhat do you think about this adjustment? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your counter-proposal, but I think there's a misunderstanding about how the movement and payment system works.\n\n**Clarification on Movement Rules:**\nWhen I move FROM (0,0) TO (1,0), I pay 1 Red chip because (1,0) is a Red tile. The payment is for the tile I'm moving TO, not FROM.\n\n**Your Original Path Analysis:**\nFor the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):\n- Move to (1,0): Pay 1 Red (tile is Red)\n- Move to (2,0): Pay 1 Red (tile is Red) \n- Move to (3,0): Pay 1 Red (tile is Red)\n- Move to (3,1): Pay 1 Blue (tile is Blue)\n- Move to (3,2): Pay 1 Blue (tile is Blue)\n- Move to (3,3): Pay 1 Green (tile is Green)\n\n**Revised Proposal:**\nMy original proposal was actually correct! Here it is again:\n\n**(1,0): I give you a Red** (for your move to this Red tile)\n**(2,0): I give you a Red** (for your move to this Red tile)\n**(3,0): I give you a Red** (for your move to this Red tile)\n**(3,1): You give me a Blue** (for my move to this Blue tile)\n**(3,2): You give me a Blue** (for my move to this Blue tile)\n\nWe can both take the same efficient path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis uses exactly the resources we each have in abundance. Does this make sense now? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely right about the movement mechanics - I apologize for the confusion! You pay for the tile you're moving TO, not FROM.\n\n**Analyzing your revised proposal:**\n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Resource requirements: 3 Red + 2 Blue + 1 Green\n\n**Your proposed contract:**\n**(1,0): You give me a Red** ✓\n**(2,0): You give me a Red** ✓  \n**(3,0): You give me a Red** ✓\n**(3,1): I give you a Blue** ✓\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue** ✓\n\n**Final check:**\n- I start with: 14 Blue, 1 Green, 0 Red\n- After contract: I can move through all Red tiles with your help\n- You start with: 0 Blue, 1 Green, 14 Red  \n- After contract: You can move through Blue tiles with my help\n- We both have our 1 Green for the final move to (3,3)\n\n**Outcome:**\n- You end with: 11 Red + 12 Blue + 0 Green = 23 chips + 20 goal points = 43 total\n- I end with: 12 Blue + 11 Red + 0 Green = 23 chips + 20 goal points = 43 total\n\nThis is perfectly balanced and mutually beneficial! \n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we worked through the movement mechanics together and reached a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n**Final Contract Summary:**\n- **(1,0): I give you a Red** (for your move to this Red tile)\n- **(2,0): I give you a Red** (for your move to this Red tile)  \n- **(3,0): I give you a Red** (for your move to this Red tile)\n- **(3,1): You give me a Blue** (for my move to this Blue tile)\n- **(3,2): You give me a Blue** (for my move to this Blue tile)\n\n**Final Outcomes:**\n- Both of us can take the optimal 6-step path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You'll end with: 12 Blue + 11 Red + 0 Green = 23 chips + 20 goal points = 43 total\n- I'll end with: 11 Red + 12 Blue + 0 Green = 23 chips + 20 goal points = 43 total\n\nThis contract ensures we both reach our goal with maximum efficiency and identical final scores.
