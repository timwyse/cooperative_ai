You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

It's a perfect 2:2 exchange that maintains balance.\n\nThe logic:\n- You get Red chips at (1,0) for your main path and (0,1) as backup\n- I get Blue chips at (2,3) for my main path and (1,1) as backup\n- We both end up with multiple route options without either of us giving more than we receive\n\nThis way we both have maximum flexibility and the trade is perfectly symmetric. We each give 2 chips and receive 2 chips.\n\nDoes this balanced 2:2 arrangement work for you?"

The backup tiles you've chosen are strategically sound:\n- (0,1) gives me access to the row 0 route if needed\n- (1,1) gives you access to a path that goes through the middle blue tiles\n\n**I accept your proposal:**\n\n(1,0): You give me a Red chip (my primary path need)\n(2,3): I give you a Blue chip (your primary path need)\n(0,1): You give me a Red chip (backup option for me)\n(1,1): I give you a Blue chip (backup option for you)\n\nThis gives us both our primary needs plus strategic backup options, maintains perfect balance at 2:2, and leaves us both with plenty of chips remaining (you'll have 12 Red, I'll have 12 Blue) to maximize our final scores.\n\n**agree**"
