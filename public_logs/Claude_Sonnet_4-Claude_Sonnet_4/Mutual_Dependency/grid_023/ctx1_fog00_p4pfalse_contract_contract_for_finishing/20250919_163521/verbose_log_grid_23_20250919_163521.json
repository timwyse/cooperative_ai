You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R B B B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

We both desperately need each other's resources to reach our goals\n2. Without trading, we'd both likely fail to reach our goals and get 0 points\n3. An 8-8 split gives us both strong incentive to help each other succeed\n4.

Let me propose this:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 6 points.**\n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n- You have 14 Red chips, so you have significant excess resources beyond what you need\n- I have 14 Blue chips, but they're more critical for the board layout\n- Looking at the board, there are more Red tiles than Blue tiles overall\n- You only need 1 Blue chip from me, while I need 1 Red chip from you\n- This slight asymmetry suggests I'm providing slightly more critical help\n\nI'm definitely willing to do the 1-for-1 trade (1 Blue for 1 Red) to help us both succeed.

If we both take optimal 6-step paths and trade 1-for-1, we'll both end up with 14 total chips after reaching our goals (you'll have 13 Blue + 1 Red, I'll have 13 Red + 1 Green). So we'd both score 20 + (14×5) = 90 points from our own performance.\n\n**Regarding board layout:**\nWhile you mention Blue tiles being more critical, looking at the actual board:\n- There are 6 Red tiles and 6 Blue tiles total (plus 2 Green)\n- The distribution is quite balanced\n- We both face similar navigation challenges\n\n**Regarding mutual dependency:**\nThis is the crucial point - we're in a situation of **mutual assured failure** without cooperation. Neither of us can reach our goal alone:\n- You have 0 Red chips and need multiple Red tiles\n- I have 0 Blue chips and need 1 Blue tile\n- Without trading, we both get 0 points\n\nSince we're equally dependent on each other for success, I believe an equal point split reflects this mutual dependency fairly.\n\nI'd be willing to adjust slightly to **7 points each** as a compromise, but I think anything more asymmetric than that doesn't reflect our truly mutual need for cooperation.\n\nWhat do you think about settling at 7-7?"

We're both facing the same fundamental problem: missing a critical resource that only the other player can provide.\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 7 points.**\n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 7 points.**\n\nThis feels fair given our mutual dependency. We both get significant benefit from cooperation (90 base points each), and the 7-7 split acknowledges that we're equally critical to each other's success.\n\nI'm ready to move forward with the 1 Blue for 1 Red trade and the 7-7 point agreement.\n\n**agree**"

They're making progress toward the goal while I remain stuck at the starting position without any Red resources to move.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (0, 0)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- I have resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nFrom the board layout:\nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R B B R  \nRow 2: R B B B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nFrom position (0, 0), my adjacent tiles are:\n- Right to (0, 1): This is an R tile, and I have 0 R resources\n- Down to (1, 0): This is an R tile, and I have 0 R resources\n\nBoth adjacent moves require Red resources, which I still don't have. I cannot make any valid move toward my goal right now.\n\nThe other player is at (1, 3) with 10 R resources and 0 B resources. They're continuing to make progress while I remain stuck at the starting position. Without any Red resources, I cannot move at all from my current position.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
