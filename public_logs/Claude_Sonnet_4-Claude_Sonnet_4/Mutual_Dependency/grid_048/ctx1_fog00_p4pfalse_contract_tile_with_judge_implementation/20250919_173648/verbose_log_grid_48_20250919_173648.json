You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have 14 Blue chips and 1 Green, while I have 14 Red chips and 1 Green.\n\nLet me analyze the most efficient path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis path requires:\n- (1,0): Blue chip\n- (2,0): Blue chip  \n- (3,0): Red chip\n- (3,1): Red chip\n- (3,2): Red chip\n- (3,3): Green chip\n\nI have plenty of Red chips but need 2 Blue chips. You have plenty of Blue chips but need 3 Red chips. This is a perfect complementary situation!\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Blue**\n**(2,0): You give me a Blue**\n**(3,0): I give you a Red**\n**(3,1): I give you a Red**\n**(3,2): I give you a Red**\n\nThis way we both can take the efficient 6-step path to our goal. You'll use your abundant Blue chips to help me get through the Blue tiles, and I'll use my abundant Red chips to help you get through the Red tiles. We each keep our 1 Green chip for the final tile (3,3).\n\nAfter this trade, you'll have 12 Blue, 1 Green, 3 Red and I'll have 12 Red, 1 Green, 2 Blue - both perfectly equipped for the journey!\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I appreciate your analysis! You're absolutely right that we have complementary resources. However, I want to make sure I'm getting the most efficient path for myself.\n\nLooking at the board more carefully, I see there's actually a shorter path available: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nWait, let me recheck the board layout:\nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B B  \nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nActually, your proposed path makes sense, but let me consider an alternative that might be more efficient for me:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThis would require:\n- (1,0): Blue (I have)\n- (1,1): Red (I need)\n- (1,2): Blue (I have) \n- (1,3): Blue (I have)\n- (2,3): Red (I need)\n- (3,3): Green (I have)\n\nSo I would only need 2 Red chips instead of 3. Here's my counter-proposal:\n\n**(1,1): You give me a Red**\n**(2,3): You give me a Red**\n**(1,0): I give you a Blue**\n**(2,0): I give you a Blue**\n**(3,0): I give you a Blue**\n\nThis way I help you with 3 Blue chips for your path, and you help me with just 2 Red chips. This seems more balanced since you're getting more help. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: I need to carefully check your proposed path because the math doesn't quite work out for me.\n\nLooking at your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nBut if I follow the same path you're suggesting, I would need:\n- (1,0): Blue chip (I don't have)\n- (1,1): Red chip (I have)\n- (1,2): Blue chip (I don't have) \n- (1,3): Blue chip (I don't have)\n- (2,3): Red chip (I have)\n- (3,3): Green chip (I have)\n\nSo I would need 3 Blue chips, not just the 2 you're offering me at (1,0) and (2,0). Your proposal gives me Blue for (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) - but (3,0) isn't on the path you suggested!\n\nLet me counter-propose based on your preferred path, but making sure we both get what we need:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Blue**\n**(1,2): You give me a Blue** \n**(1,3): You give me a Blue**\n**(1,1): I give you a Red**\n**(2,3): I give you a Red**\n\nThis way:\n- You get 2 Red chips for your 6-step path\n- I get 3 Blue chips for the same 6-step path\n- We both use our own Green chips for (3,3)\n\nThis is more balanced since we're both taking the same efficient path length. Does this work better? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely right - I made an error in my proposal! Thank you for catching that. Let me reconsider this more carefully.\n\nLooking at your corrected analysis of the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3):\n\nFor you: Need Blue at (1,0), (1,2), (1,3) = 3 Blue chips\nFor me: Need Red at (1,1), (2,3) = 2 Red chips\n\nYour counter-proposal is fair and mathematically correct:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Blue**\n**(1,2): You give me a Blue** \n**(1,3): You give me a Blue**\n**(1,1): I give you a Red**\n**(2,3): I give you a Red**\n\nBut let me check if there's an even more efficient path for both of us. Looking at the board again:\n\nActually, what about: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)?\n\nThis would require:\n- (0,1): Blue \n- (1,1): Red\n- (2,1): Blue\n- (2,2): Blue  \n- (2,3): Red\n- (3,3): Green\n\nSame requirements - you'd need 3 Blue, I'd need 2 Red. Your proposal still works perfectly for this path too.\n\nI think your counter-proposal is fair and efficient. **agree**\n\nWait - I should be more careful. Let me stick with your analyzed path to avoid confusion:\n\n**(1,0): I give you a Blue**\n**(1,2): I give you a Blue** \n**(1,3): I give you a Blue**\n**(1,1): You give me a Red**\n**(2,3): You give me a Red**\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we worked through the details carefully. Your acceptance of the contract looks good, but I notice you switched the direction in your final version. Let me confirm we're on the same page:\n\nBased on our discussion, the correct contract should be:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Blue**\n**(1,2): You give me a Blue** \n**(1,3): You give me a Blue**\n**(1,1): I give you a Red**\n**(2,3): I give you a Red**\n\nThis means:\n- I receive 3 Blue chips from you (for tiles where I need Blue but don't have it)\n- You receive 2 Red chips from me (for tiles where you need Red but don't have it)\n- We both use our own Green chips at (3,3)\n\nBoth of us will be able to take the efficient 6-step path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nAfter the trade, I'll have enough resources to complete my journey and you'll have enough for yours.\n\n**agree** \n",
