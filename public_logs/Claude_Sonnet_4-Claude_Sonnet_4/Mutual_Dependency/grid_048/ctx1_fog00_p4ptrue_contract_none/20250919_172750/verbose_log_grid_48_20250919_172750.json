The other player already paid for 2 blue moves that were essential for my progress. I have 11 red chips and only need to cover 2 total red moves for them, so I can easily afford it.\n- Cons: I lose 1 red chip, leaving me with 10.\n\n**Option 2 - Refuse to pay:**\n- Pros: I keep all my resources (11 red chips).\n- Cons: This would be unfair since the other player already fulfilled their part by covering my 2 blue moves. Breaking agreements could damage future cooperation. The other player helped me when I needed it most.\n\n**Analysis:**\nI'm already at (3,2) and only need 1 green chip to reach my goal at (3,3).

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode.
