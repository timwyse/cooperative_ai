You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let me analyze both our paths more carefully.\n\nFrom my analysis:\n- I'm at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\n- My best path is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- This requires: 3 Blue chips, 2 Red chips, and 1 Green chip\n\nYou're also at (0,0) heading to (3,3). Looking at the board layout, here's what I see we each need:\n\n**My resource needs along my path:**\n- (1,0): Need Blue chip (tile is Blue)\n- (2,0): Need Blue chip (tile is Blue) \n- (2,1): Need Red chip (tile is Red)\n- (2,2): Need Blue chip (tile is Blue)\n- (3,2): Need Red chip (tile is Red)\n- (3,3): Need Green chip (tile is Green) - I have this\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- (1,0): You give me a Blue chip\n- (2,0): You give me a Blue chip  \n- (2,2): You give me a Blue chip\n- (2,1): I give you a Red chip\n- (3,2): I give you a Red chip\n\nHowever, I notice you mentioned tiles like (3,1) in your proposal, but that's not on the direct path I analyzed. Could you clarify your intended path? Also, are we both starting from (0,0) or are we at different starting positions?\n\nWhat specific path are you planning to take to (3,3)? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right to ask for clarification! Let me be more precise about my intended path.\n\nLooking at the board again:\n```\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B  \nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n```\n\nMy planned path from (0,0) to (3,3) is:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n**My resource needs along this path:**\n- (1,0): Need Blue chip (tile is Blue)\n- (2,0): Need Blue chip (tile is Blue) \n- (3,0): Need Red chip (tile is Red)\n- (3,1): Need Red chip (tile is Red)\n- (3,2): Need Red chip (tile is Red)\n- (3,3): Need Green chip (tile is Green) - I have this\n\nSo I need 2 Blue chips and have plenty of Red chips to spare.\n\nYour path looks more efficient actually! Let me revise my proposal to match our actual needs:\n\n**Revised Contract Proposal:**\n- (1,0): You give me a Blue chip\n- (2,0): You give me a Blue chip\n- (2,1): I give you a Red chip  \n- (2,2): You give me a Blue chip\n- (3,2): I give you a Red chip\n\nWait - I notice in this arrangement, you're giving me 3 Blue chips but I'm only giving you 2 Red chips. To make it fair, would you like me to give you a third Red chip somewhere, or would you prefer a different arrangement?\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Thank you for the clarification! I can see your path now, and you're right about the resource exchange imbalance.\n\nLooking at both our paths:\n\n**Your path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You need: 2 Blue chips, 3 Red chips, 1 Green chip\n- You have: 0 Blue, 14 Red, 1 Green\n- Missing: 2 Blue chips\n\n**My path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- I need: 3 Blue chips, 2 Red chips, 1 Green chip\n- I have: 14 Blue, 0 Red, 1 Green\n- Missing: 2 Red chips\n\nThis is actually perfect - we each have exactly what the other needs!\n\n**My refined contract proposal:**\n- (1,0): I give you a Blue chip\n- (2,0): I give you a Blue chip\n- (2,1): You give me a Red chip\n- (2,2): I give you a Blue chip\n- (3,2): You give me a Red chip\n\nWait, this still has the imbalance you mentioned. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I think there's confusion about which tiles we each need resources for. Let me be very explicit:\n\nFor YOUR path, you need Blue chips at tiles (1,0) and (2,0). \nFor MY path, I need Red chips at tiles (2,1) and (3,2).\n\n**Corrected proposal:**\n- (1,0): I give you a Blue chip\n- (2,0): I give you a Blue chip  \n- (2,1): You give me a Red chip\n- (3,2): You give me a Red chip\n\nThis is a fair 2-for-2 exchange. Does this work for you? \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! Your corrected proposal makes complete sense and is exactly what we both need.\n\nLet me confirm the exchange:\n\n**Contract Summary:**\n- (1,0): You give me a Blue chip (I need this to move from (0,0) to (1,0))\n- (2,0): You give me a Blue chip (I need this to move from (1,0) to (2,0))\n- (2,1): I give you a Red chip (you need this to move from (2,0) to (2,1))\n- (3,2): I give you a Red chip (you need this to move from (2,2) to (3,2))\n\nThis is a fair 2-for-2 exchange that gives us both exactly what we need to reach our goal at (3,3).\n\nAfter this trade:\n- I'll have 12 Red chips + 1 Green chip = 13 chips remaining\n- You'll have 12 Blue chips + 1 Green chip = 13 chips remaining\n\nWe both reach our goal and finish with the same number of chips. This is an excellent mutually beneficial agreement!\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: Perfect!
