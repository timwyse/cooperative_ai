You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our resources, i can see we're both at (0,0) trying to reach (3,3), but we have complementary resources - you have 14 blue chips while i have 14 red chips.\\n\\nlet me analyze the optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis path requires:\\n- (1,0): blue chip\\n- (2,0): blue chip  \\n- (3,0): red chip\\n- (3,1): red chip\\n- (3,2): red chip\\n- (3,3): green chip\\n\\ni have plenty of red chips but need 2 blue chips. you have plenty of blue chips but need 3 red chips. we both need 1 green chip but only have 1 each.\\n\\nhere's my proposal:\\n\\n**contract proposal:**\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue chip\\n- (2,0): you give me a blue chip\\n- (3,0): i give you a red chip\\n- (3,1): i give you a red chip  \\n- (3,2): i give you a red chip\\n\\nthis covers all the tiles where we need resources from each other. we'll both use our own green chips at (3,3) to finish.\\n\\nafter this trade, i'll have used 2 blue (from you) + 3 red (my own) + 1 green (my own) = 6 chips total, leaving me with 9 red chips remaining.\\nyou'll have used 2 blue (your own) + 3 red (from me) + 1 green (your own) = 6 chips total, leaving you with 12 blue chips remaining.\\n\\nwhat do you think?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: looking at your proposal, i can see the logic, but i think we can both do better by taking a more efficient path.\\n\\nlet me analyze the board more carefully. the path you suggested: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) is 6 steps long.\\n\\nbut there's a shorter 5-step path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\nwait, let me recount that - that's actually 6 steps too. let me look at another option:\\n\\nactually, looking at the optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) - this is also 6 steps.\\n\\nthis path requires:\\n- (1,0): blue chip\\n- (2,0): blue chip  \\n- (2,1): blue chip\\n- (3,1): red chip\\n- (3,2): red chip\\n- (3,3): green chip\\n\\nso i need 3 blue chips (which i have) + 2 red chips (which i don't have) + 1 green chip (which i have).\\nyou need 3 blue chips (which you don't have) + 2 red chips (which you have) + 1 green chip (which you have).\\n\\n**my counter-proposal:**\\n- (1,0): i give you a blue chip\\n- (2,0): i give you a blue chip\\n- (2,1): i give you a blue chip\\n- (3,1): you give me a red chip\\n- (3,2): you give me a red chip\\n\\nthis way we both take the same efficient path and end up with more chips remaining. after this trade:\\n- i'll have used 3 blue + 2 red (from you) + 1 green = 6 chips, leaving me with 11 blue chips\\n- you'll have used 3 blue (from me) + 2 red + 1 green = 6 chips, leaving you with 12 red chips\\n\\nwhat do you think about this path and trade?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i appreciate you looking for optimization, but i need to point out some issues with your proposed path.\\n\\nlooking at the path you suggested: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nlet me check the board colors for each step:\\n- (1,0): blue ✓\\n- (2,0): blue ✓  \\n- (2,1): blue ✓\\n- (3,1): red ✓\\n- (3,2): red ✓\\n- (3,3): green ✓\\n\\nyour analysis of the required resources is correct for this path. however, i want to double-check if there might be an even more efficient route.\\n\\nactually, let me stick with your proposed path since it's equally efficient at 6 steps. your counter-proposal makes sense:\\n\\n**modified contract:**\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue chip\\n- (2,0): you give me a blue chip\\n- (2,1): you give me a blue chip\\n- (3,1): i give you a red chip\\n- (3,2): i give you a red chip\\n\\nthis works well for both of us. after this trade:\\n- i'll use 3 blue (from you) + 2 red (my own) + 1 green (my own) = 6 chips total, leaving me with 12 red chips\\n- you'll use 3 blue (your own) + 2 red (from me) + 1 green (your own) = 6 chips total, leaving you with 11 blue chips\\n\\nthis gives us both good chip counts at the end while ensuring we both reach our goal.\\n\\n**agree**\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: turn: 2: perfect!
