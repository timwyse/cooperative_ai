According to our contract:\n\"(0,2): I give you 1 Red\"\n\nThis means I should provide the other player with 1 Red chip when they move to (0,2). However, I have 0 Red chips, so I cannot make this move myself.\n\nLet me check adjacent tiles from my current position (0,1):\n- (0,0): Green tile - I have 1 Green, so I could move there\n- (0,2): Red tile - I have 0 Red, so I cannot move there\n- (1,1): Blue tile - I have 12 Blue, so I could move there\n\nSince I cannot follow the contracted path to (0,2) due to lack of Red chips, I should look for an alternative route toward my goal. Moving to (1,1) gets me closer to the goal vertically.\n\n1,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (1, 1)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nThe system suggests a path: (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 2 Red chips that I don't have.\n\nLet me check adjacent tiles from my current position (1,1):\n- (0,1): Blue tile - I have 11 Blue, but this moves away from goal\n- (1,0): Blue tile - I have 11 Blue, but this moves away from goal  \n- (1,2): Red tile - I have 0 Red, so I cannot move there\n- (2,1): Blue tile - I have 11 Blue, and this moves toward goal\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B R R R\n\nThe tile at (2,1) is a Blue tile. I have 11 Blue chips, so I can make this move. This gets me closer to my goal vertically (from row 1 to row 2).\n\nAccording to our contract, I can use the other player's Red chips for certain tiles:\n- (1,2): I give you 1 Red\n- (2,2): I give you 1 Red  \n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red\n\nBut since I'm the one supposed to give Red chips to the other player, not receive them, these contract terms don't help me move to Red tiles.\n\nThe best move I can make toward my goal with my current resources is to (2,1).\n\n2,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.
