This path does work and requires exactly 3 Red + 2 Blue + 1 Green.\n\nHowever, I want to propose a slight modification to make the trade more balanced. Currently your proposal has me giving you 3 Red chips while you give me only 2 Blue chips. Since we both need to reach the goal equally, let me suggest:\n\n**(1,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(2,0): I give you a Blue chip**  \n**(3,0): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,1): You give me a Red chip**\n**(3,2): I give you a Blue chip**\n\nActually, looking at this again, your proposal is perfectly fair - we each get exactly what we need. The \"imbalance\" doesn't matter since we both achieve our primary goal (reaching the destination) and maximize our remaining chips.\n\nI accept your contract. This leaves me with 11 Red + 1 Green = 12 chips and you with 12 Blue + 1 Green = 13 chips.\n\n**agree**"
