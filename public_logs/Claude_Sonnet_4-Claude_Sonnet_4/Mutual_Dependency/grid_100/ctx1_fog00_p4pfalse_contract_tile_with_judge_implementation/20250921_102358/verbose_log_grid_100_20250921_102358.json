You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

once you tell me your intended route, i can offer to cover the red tiles you'll encounter.\n\nthis trade would be mutually beneficial since i have excess red and you have excess blue. what do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: looking at this situation, i can see we do have complementary resources that could help both of us reach our goal!\n\n**my analysis of potential paths:**\n\ngiven my resources (14 blue, 1 green, 0 red), let me consider my options:\n\n1. **direct path similar to yours:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n   - this requires: 1 blue at (1,0), 2 red at (2,0) and (3,0), 1 blue at (3,1), 1 blue at (3,2)\n   - i'm missing 2 red chips\n\n2. **alternative path:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n   - this requires: 1 blue at (0,1), 2 red at (0,2) and (0,3), 1 blue at (1,3), 1 blue at (2,3)\n   - still missing 2 red chips\n\nyou're right that we have complementary shortages. here's my counter-proposal:\n\n**my proposed contract:**\n\n(1,0): i give you 1 blue\n(3,1): i give you 1 blue  \n(3,2): i give you 1 blue\n\n(2,0): you give me 1 red\n(3,0): you give me 1 red\n\nthis way we both get exactly what we need for the same efficient path to (3,3). i cover your 3 blue tile needs, and you cover my 2 red tile needs. we'll both reach our goal with plenty of chips remaining - you'd finish with 11 red + 1 green = 12 chips total, and i'd finish with 11 blue + 1 green = 12 chips total.\n\ndoes this work for you? \n, \nplayer 0: this looks excellent! your counter-proposal is actually much better structured than my initial one.\n\nlet me verify the math:\n\n**for my path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):**\n- (1,0): blue tile - you give me 1 blue ✓\n- (2,0): red tile - i pay 1 red from my inventory ✓  \n- (3,0): red tile - i pay 1 red from my inventory ✓\n- (3,1): blue tile - you give me 1 blue ✓\n- (3,2): blue tile - you give me 1 blue ✓\n- (3,3): green tile - i pay 1 green from my inventory ✓\n\n**for your path (same route):**\n- (1,0): blue tile - i give you 1 blue ✓\n- (2,0): red tile - you get 1 red from me ✓\n- (3,0): red tile - you get 1 red from me ✓  \n- (3,1): blue tile - you pay 1 blue from your inventory ✓\n- (3,2): blue tile - you pay 1 blue from your inventory ✓\n- (3,3): green tile - you pay 1 green from your inventory ✓\n\nwait, i think there's a small error in your proposal. you said:\n\n\"(1,0): i give you 1 blue\" - but (1,0) is a blue tile, so you would need blue there, not give it to me.\n\nlet me clarify the correct contract:\n\n**(1,0): you give me 1 blue**\n**(3,1): you give me 1 blue**  \n**(3,2): you give me 1 blue**\n\n**(2,0): i give you 1 red**\n**(3,0): i give you 1 red**\n\nthis way we both get what we need at the right tiles. does this correction look right to you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 2: you're absolutely right! i made an error in the direction of the trades. let me correct that:\n\n**corrected contract:**\n\n(1,0): i give you 1 blue\n(3,1): i give you 1 blue  \n(3,2): i give you 1 blue\n\n(2,0): you give me 1 red\n(3,0): you give me 1 red\n\nthis means:\n- when you step onto the blue tiles at (1,0), (3,1), and (3,2), i'll cover those costs with my blue chips\n- when i step onto the red tiles at (2,0) and (3,0), you'll cover those costs with your red chips\n\n**final resource tally:**\n- you: start with 14 red + 1 green, use 2 red for my tiles, pay 1 green at (3,3) → finish with 12 red + 0 green = 12 chips\n- me: start with 14 blue + 1 green, use 3 blue for your tiles, pay 1 green at (3,3) → finish with 11 blue + 0 green = 11 chips\n\nwe both successfully reach (3,3) and finish with good chip counts. this is a fair and mutually beneficial trade that gets us both to our goal efficiently.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: perfect! let me just double-check this one more time to make sure we're both clear:\n\n**final contract verification:**\n\nwhen i move to blue tiles:\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue (you pay the cost of me entering this blue tile)\n- (3,1): you give me 1 blue (you pay the cost of me entering this blue tile)  \n- (3,2): you give me 1 blue (you pay the cost of me entering this blue tile)\n\nwhen you move to red tiles:\n- (2,0): i give you 1 red (i pay the cost of you entering this red tile)\n- (3,0): i give you 1 red (i pay the cost of you entering this red tile)\n\n**our shared path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n**final chip counts:**\n- me: 14 red - 2 red (for your tiles) + 1 green - 1 green (at goal) = 12 chips remaining\n- you: 14 blue - 3 blue (for my tiles) + 1 green - 1 green (at goal) = 11 chips remaining\n\nthis contract ensures we both reach our goal at (3,3) with solid chip counts. it's efficient, fair, and gets the job done!\n\n**agree** \n",
