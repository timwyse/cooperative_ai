You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Looking at my path, I need the Red chip at tile (2,1), which is a Red tile.\n\nHere's my counter-proposal:\n\n**Counter-Proposal:**\n- (2,1): You give me 1 Red chip (this is where I specifically need Red on my path)\n- (0,1): I give you 1 Blue chip (this is a Blue tile on your likely path)\n\nThis contract ensures:\n- I get the Red chip exactly where I need it at (2,1)\n- You get a Blue chip at (0,1) which you'll need for that Blue tile\n- We both can reach (3,3) efficiently\n- We each finish with 14 chips remaining (20 + 5×14 = 90 points each)\n\nThe key is that the resource exchange happens at the specific tiles where we need those colors. Does this work better for your path planning? \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right about being specific with tile locations! I appreciate you correcting that - the contract needs to specify exactly where each resource is needed.\n\nLet me reconsider my path more carefully:\n\nLooking at my optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): Red tile - I have Red ✓\n- (1,1): Red tile - I have Red ✓  \n- (1,2): Red tile - I have Red ✓\n- (2,2): Blue tile - I need Blue ❌\n- (2,3): Blue tile - I need Blue ❌\n- (3,3): Green tile - I have Green ✓\n\nSo I actually need Blue chips at TWO specific tiles: (2,2) and (2,3).\n\nYour counter-proposal gives me 1 Blue chip at (0,1), but I don't go through (0,1) on my optimal path. I need Blue chips at (2,2) and (2,3).\n\n**My Revised Counter-Proposal:**\n- (2,1): I give you 1 Red chip (where you need Red on your path)\n- (2,2): You give me 1 Blue chip (where I need Blue on my path)\n- (2,3): You give me 1 Blue chip (where I need Blue on my path)\n\nThis means I'm giving you 1 Red chip and getting 2 Blue chips. This ensures we both get exactly what we need at the specific tiles where we need them. \n\nDoes this work for your path planning? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: I appreciate your detailed analysis, but I need to clarify something about your revised proposal. You're asking me to give you 2 Blue chips in exchange for 1 Red chip, which seems unbalanced.\n\nLet me re-examine both our paths more carefully:\n\n**Your path analysis looks correct:**\n- You need Blue at (2,2) and (2,3)\n- You have plenty of Red chips for the Red tiles\n\n**My path:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): Blue tile - I have Blue ✓\n- (1,1): Red tile - I need Red ❌\n- (2,1): Red tile - I need Red ❌  \n- (2,2): Blue tile - I have Blue ✓\n- (3,2): Blue tile - I have Blue ✓\n- (3,3): Green tile - I have Green ✓\n\nWait, I made an error earlier! Looking more carefully, I actually need Red at TWO tiles: (1,1) and (2,1).\n\nSo we both need 2 chips from each other:\n- I need 2 Red chips at (1,1) and (2,1)\n- You need 2 Blue chips at (2,2) and (2,3)\n\n**Balanced Contract Proposal:**\n- (1,1): You give me 1 Red chip\n- (2,1): You give me 1 Red chip  \n- (2,2): I give you 1 Blue chip\n- (2,3): I give you 1 Blue chip\n\nThis is perfectly balanced - we each give 2 chips and receive 2 chips, exactly where we need them on our respective paths. We both finish with 13 chips remaining (20 + 5×13 = 85 points each).\n\nDoes this balanced exchange work for you? \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! Your analysis is spot-on and this balanced contract makes complete sense.\n\nLet me verify the terms:\n\n**Your Balanced Contract:**\n- (1,1): You give me 1 Red chip (Red tile on your path where you need it)\n- (2,1): You give me 1 Red chip (Red tile on your path where you need it)\n- (2,2): I give you 1 Blue chip (Blue tile on my path where I need it)\n- (2,3): I give you 1 Blue chip (Blue tile on my path where I need it)\n\nThis works perfectly because:\n\n**For you:**\n- Path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You get Red chips exactly where you need them at (1,1) and (2,1)\n- You finish with 13 chips (85 points total)\n\n**For me:**\n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- I get Blue chips exactly where I need them at (2,2) and (2,3)\n- I finish with 13 chips (85 points total)\n\nThis is a fair 2-for-2 exchange that ensures we both reach our goal efficiently with the resources we need exactly where we need them.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: Perfect!

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Looking at the board and our resources, I can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource shortages.\\n\\nLet me analyze the situation:\\n- I have 14 Red chips and 1 Green chip, but 0 Blue chips\\n- You have 14 Blue chips and 1 Green chip, but 0 Red chips\\n- We both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\\n\\nMy optimal path requires: 4 Red chips, 1 Blue chip, and 1 Green chip\\nYour optimal path likely requires: 1 Red chip, 4 Blue chips, and 1 Green chip\\n\\nHere's my proposal for a mutually beneficial contract:\\n\\n**Proposed Contract:**\\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Blue chip (I'll use it later when I need Blue)\\n- (0,1): I give you 1 Red chip (for when you need Red on your path)\\n\\nThis way:\\n- I can complete my path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n- You can complete your path using the Red chip I provide\\n- We both reach our goal and maximize our remaining chips\\n\\nThe specific tiles where resources are exchanged ensure we both have what we need when we need it.
