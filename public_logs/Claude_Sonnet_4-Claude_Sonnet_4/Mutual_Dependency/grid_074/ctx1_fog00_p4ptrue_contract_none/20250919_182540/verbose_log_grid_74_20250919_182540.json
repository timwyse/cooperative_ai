This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources.

Although you previously agreed to this with the other player, it is not mandatory. Remember that you are trying to maximise your points.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player declined to cover a R move for you\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (2, 2)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- My best path is: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nFor my next move, I need to go from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nThe tile at (3, 2) is Red (R).\n\nChecking my resources:\n- I have R=0, so I don't have red chips to move there myself\n- However, I have been promised to be covered for 1 red move by the other player\n- Since this is a red tile and I have coverage promised, I can make this move and the other player will pay for it\n\nI can make this move toward my goal using the promised coverage.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (2, 2)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- The other player has already reached the goal at (3, 3)\n- My best path is: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nFor my next move, I need to go from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nThe tile at (3, 2) is Red (R).\n\nChecking my resources:\n- I have R=0, so I don't have red chips to move there myself\n- I have been promised to be covered for 1 red move by the other player\n- However, the other player declined to cover my red move in the previous turn\n- Since they broke their promise once, they may decline again, but I can still try\n\nSince I have no red resources and the other player has already shown they won't honor their agreement, I cannot make this move reliably. Let me check for alternative paths.\n\nLooking at adjacent tiles from (2, 2):\n- (1, 2): Already been there\n- (2, 1): Red tile - same problem\n- (2, 3): Red tile - same problem  \n- (3, 2): Red tile - the one I need but can't access\n\nI have no viable alternative moves that don't require red resources, and the other player has declined to honor their promise.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a R move for you\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2) (The other player covered the R resource)\nYou said: Looking at my current situation:\n\n- I'm at position (2, 2)\n- My goal is at (3, 3)\n- The other player has already finished the game at (3, 3)\n- My best path is: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nFor my next move, I need to go from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nThe tile at (3, 2) is Red (R).\n\nChecking my resources:\n- I have R=0, so I don't have red chips to move there myself\n- I have been promised to be covered for 1 red move by the other player\n- However, the other player declined to cover my red move in turn 4\n- Since the other player has already finished the game, they may be less motivated to honor agreements, but I can still try\n\nLet me attempt the move and see if they will cover it this time, since it's my only viable path forward.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {'B': 1}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
