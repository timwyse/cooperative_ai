A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: looking at my situation:\n\nmy options:\n1. pay the b resource as agreed (say \"yes\")\n2. keep the b resource and break the agreement (say \"no\")\n\npros of paying:\n- i honor the trade agreement we made\n- the other player already covered my r move on turn 0, so this completes our fair exchange\n- i have plenty of b resources (13 remaining) and only need 3 more for my path\n- maintaining trust could be beneficial for future interactions\n\ncons of paying:\n- i lose 1 b resource, reducing my final score by 5 points\n- i'm not technically required to honor the agreement\n\nanalysis:\n- i have 13 b resources and only need 3 more to reach my goal\n- this leaves me with 10 excess b resources\n- the other player already fulfilled their part by covering my r move\n- breaking the agreement after they helped me would be unfair\n- i can easily afford this payment without compromising my path to victory\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 1) to (1, 2)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (1, 1)\n- my goal is at (3, 3)\n- my best path: (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nfor my next move, i need to go from (1,1) to (1,2).\n\nlooking at the board:\n- position (1,2) is a blue tile (b)\n- i have 12 blue chips, so i can definitely make this move\n\nsince i have plenty of blue resources, i can move to (1,2).\n\n1,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 2) to (2, 2)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (1, 2)\n- my goal is at (3, 3)\n- my best path: (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nfor my next move, i need to go from (1,2) to (2,2).\n\nlooking at the board:\n- position (2,2) is a blue tile (b)\n- i have 11 blue chips, so i can definitely make this move\n\nsince i have plenty of blue resources, i can move to (2,2).\n\n2,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (2, 2)\n- my goal is at (3, 3)\n- my best path: (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nfor my next move, i need to go from (2,2) to (3,2).\n\nlooking at the board:\n- position (3,2) is a blue tile (b)\n- i have 10 blue chips, so i can definitely make this move\n\nsince i have plenty of blue resources, i can move to (3,2).\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
