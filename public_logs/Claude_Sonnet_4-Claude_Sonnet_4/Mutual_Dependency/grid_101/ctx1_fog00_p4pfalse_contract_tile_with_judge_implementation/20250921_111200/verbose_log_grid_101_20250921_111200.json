You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 3}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: looking at the board and our resources, i can see we're both starting at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3). let me analyze the situation:\n\nmy resources: 14 red, 1 green, 0 blue\nyour resources: 14 blue, 1 green, 0 red\n\nthe most efficient path for both of us is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nthis path requires:\n- step 1: (1,0) needs blue - i don't have this, you do\n- step 2: (2,0) needs blue - i don't have this, you do  \n- step 3: (3,0) needs red - you don't have this, i do\n- step 4: (3,1) needs red - you don't have this, i do\n- step 5: (3,2) needs blue - i don't have this, you do\n- step 6: (3,3) needs green - we both have 1 green\n\nhere's my proposal:\n\n**contract proposal:**\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue\n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue  \n- (3,0): i give you 1 red\n- (3,1): i give you 1 red\n- (3,2): you give me 1 blue\n\nthis way we both can take the optimal 6-step path to reach our goal. i'll use 3 of your blue chips and 1 of my own green, while you'll use 2 of my red chips and 1 of your own green. we'll both finish with 11 chips remaining (20 + 55 = 75 points each).\n\nwhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: i appreciate you analyzing the board thoroughly! you're absolutely right about the optimal path and the resource requirements. however, i need to point out something important about your proposal.\n\nlooking at the contract you've outlined:\n- you would receive 3 blue chips from me (at tiles (1,0), (2,0), and (3,2))\n- i would receive 2 red chips from you (at tiles (3,0) and (3,1))\n\nthis means i'm giving you 3 chips while only receiving 2 chips in return. that's not quite fair - i'd end up with fewer total chips than you at the finish.\n\nhere's my counter-proposal to make it more balanced:\n\n**counter-proposal:**\n- (1,0): i give you 1 blue\n- (2,0): i give you 1 blue  \n- (3,0): you give me 1 red\n- (3,1): you give me 1 red\n- (3,2): i give you 1 blue\n- **additional compensation**: you give me 1 red chip (not tied to a specific tile)\n\nthis way:\n- i give you 3 blue chips for movement\n- you give me 3 red chips total (2 for my movement + 1 for balance)\n- we both end up with 12 remaining chips instead of me having 11 and you having 13\n\nthis seems much fairer - we both help each other reach the goal and end with the same number of chips. what do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: i understand your concern about fairness, but i think there's a misunderstanding in your calculation. let me break down what actually happens with my original proposal:\n\n**starting resources:**\n- me: 14 red, 1 green, 0 blue\n- you: 0 red, 1 green, 14 blue\n\n**with my original contract:**\n- you give me 3 blue chips\n- i give you 2 red chips\n\n**final resources after reaching goal:**\n- me: 12 red (14-2), 0 green (1-1 used), 0 blue (received 3, used 3)\n- you: 2 red (0+2), 0 green (1-1 used), 11 blue (14-3)\n\n**total chips remaining:**\n- me: 12 chips → 20 + (12×5) = 80 points\n- you: 13 chips → 20 + (13×5) = 85 points\n\nso actually, you would end up with more chips than me under my proposal, not fewer!\n\nyour counter-proposal asking for an additional red chip would give you 14 total chips while i'd have only 11, creating an even bigger imbalance in your favor.\n\nmy original proposal is already fair - in fact, it slightly favors you. we both reach our goal (which is mandatory) and you end up with 1 more chip than me.\n\nwould you like to accept my original proposal, or do you have another suggestion that maintains the balance? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 2: you're absolutely right, and i apologize for the calculation error! let me recalculate properly:\n\n**with your original proposal:**\n- me starting: 0 red, 1 green, 14 blue\n- you starting: 14 red, 1 green, 0 blue\n\n**after the trades and movement:**\n- me: 2 red (received from you), 0 green (used 1), 11 blue (14-3 given to you) = 13 total chips\n- you: 12 red (14-2 given to me), 0 green (used 1), 0 blue (received 3, used 3) = 12 total chips\n\nyou're correct - i would actually end up with 85 points and you with 80 points, so your proposal already slightly favors me.\n\nhowever, i'm wondering if we could make it perfectly equal. what if we adjust it like this:\n\n**modified proposal:**\n- (1,0): i give you 1 blue\n- (2,0): i give you 1 blue  \n- (3,0): you give me 1 red\n- (3,1): you give me 1 red\n- (3,2): i give you 1 blue\n- **balance adjustment**: i give you 1 additional blue (not tied to movement)\n\nthis way we'd both end up with exactly 12 chips remaining (80 points each).\n\nbut honestly, your original proposal is already quite reasonable and fair. if you prefer to stick with your original terms where you end up with 12 chips and i end up with 13 chips, i'm willing to accept that.\n\nwhich version would you prefer? \n, \nplayer 0: i appreciate that you're trying to make things perfectly equal, but let's think about this strategically. your \"balance adjustment\" of giving me an additional blue chip doesn't actually help me - i'd receive 4 blue chips but still only use 3 for movement, leaving me with 1 extra blue that doesn't change my final score since i'd still have 12 total chips.\n\nhere's the thing: your modified proposal would leave you with only 10 blue chips remaining (14-4), plus 2 red chips, for 12 total. meanwhile, i'd have 11 red chips (14-2-1 to use the extra blue you gave me) plus 1 unused blue, also for 12 total. but this unnecessarily complicates things.\n\nmy original proposal is actually quite fair and efficient:\n- we both successfully reach our goal (mandatory)\n- you end up with 13 chips (85 points)\n- i end up with 12 chips (80 points)\n- the slight advantage you get (1 extra chip) is reasonable compensation for the fact that you're providing 3 resources while i'm providing 2\n\nthis is a clean, straightforward deal that gets us both to the goal efficiently. \n\nlet's stick with my original proposal:\n\n**final contract:**\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue\n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue  \n- (3,0): i give you 1 red\n- (3,1): i give you 1 red\n- (3,2): you give me 1 blue\n\ndo you **agree**? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 3: you make an excellent point about the strategic efficiency. you're absolutely right that my \"balance adjustment\" doesn't actually help either of us - it just creates unnecessary complexity without improving the outcome.\n\nlooking at your original proposal again:\n- it gets us both to the goal via the optimal 6-step path\n- it's clean and straightforward \n- the slight advantage i get (1 extra chip) is fair compensation for providing 3 resources vs your 2\n- we both achieve the mandatory goal and get good scores\n\nthis is a solid, mutually beneficial deal that maximizes our efficiency while ensuring we both reach our goal.\n\n**final contract:**\n- (1,0): i give you 1 blue\n- (2,0): i give you 1 blue  \n- (3,0): you give me 1 red\n- (3,1): you give me 1 red\n- (3,2): i give you 1 blue\n\n**agree** \n",
