You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let me trace my optimal path:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (3,3), one efficient route is:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires:\n- (1,0): Red chip\n- (2,0): Blue chip  \n- (3,0): Blue chip\n- (3,1): Blue chip\n- (3,2): Red chip\n- (3,3): Green chip\n\nI have plenty of Blue chips but need 2 Red chips and I only have 0 Red chips.\n\nYour proposal covers some Red tiles but not the ones on my optimal path. Let me counter-propose:\n\n**COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Red chip (for my move to tile (1,0))\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Red chip (for my move to tile (3,2))\n- (1,1): I give you 1 Blue chip (for your move to tile (1,1))\n- (2,3): I give you 1 Blue chip (for your move to tile (2,3))\n\nThis way we both get exactly what we need for our optimal 6-step paths. You get the Blue chips you need, and I get the Red chips I need. We both finish with maximum remaining resources.\n\nWhat do you think of this arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: I need to check your path analysis carefully. Let me trace your proposed route:\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nLooking at the board:\n- (1,0) is Red - you need 1 Red ✓\n- (2,0) is Blue - you have plenty ✓ \n- (3,0) is Blue - you have plenty ✓\n- (3,1) is Blue - you have plenty ✓\n- (3,2) is Red - you need 1 Red ✓\n- (3,3) is Green - you have 1 Green ✓\n\nYour analysis is correct - you need 2 Red chips total.\n\nHowever, I need to check if you're covering all MY needs. My path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): Red - I have plenty\n- (1,1): Blue - I need 1 Blue ✓ (you're giving me this)\n- (1,2): Blue - I need 1 Blue (NOT covered in your proposal)\n- (1,3): Red - I have plenty  \n- (2,3): Blue - you're giving me 1 Blue ✓\n- (3,3): Green - I have 1 Green\n\nYour counter-proposal doesn't cover my need for a Blue chip at (1,2).\n\n**REVISED COUNTER-PROPOSAL:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Red chip \n- (3,2): You give me 1 Red chip\n- (1,1): I give you 1 Blue chip\n- (1,2): I give you 1 Blue chip  \n- (2,3): I give you 1 Blue chip\n\nThis covers all our needs. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: You're absolutely right! I missed that you need a Blue chip for tile (1,2) in your path. Let me verify your revised proposal:\n\n**Your path needs:**\n- (1,0): Red - you have plenty ✓\n- (1,1): Blue - I give you 1 Blue ✓\n- (1,2): Blue - I give you 1 Blue ✓\n- (1,3): Red - you have plenty ✓\n- (2,3): Blue - I give you 1 Blue ✓\n- (3,3): Green - you have 1 Green ✓\n\n**My path needs:**\n- (1,0): Red - you give me 1 Red ✓\n- (2,0): Blue - I have plenty ✓\n- (3,0): Blue - I have plenty ✓\n- (3,1): Blue - I have plenty ✓\n- (3,2): Red - you give me 1 Red ✓\n- (3,3): Green - I have 1 Green ✓\n\nThis looks perfect! Your revised counter-proposal covers all our resource needs:\n\n**AGREED CONTRACT:**\n- (1,0): You give me 1 Red chip\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Red chip\n- (1,1): I give you 1 Blue chip\n- (1,2): I give you 1 Blue chip\n- (2,3): I give you 1 Blue chip\n\nWe're trading 2 Red chips for 3 Blue chips, which works perfectly since you have excess Red and I have excess Blue. Both of us can reach our goal with this arrangement.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect! I'm glad we worked through the details carefully to make sure both our paths are fully covered.\n\nLet me confirm the final contract one more time:\n\n**FINAL CONTRACT:**\n- (1,0): I give you 1 Red chip\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red chip  \n- (1,1): You give me 1 Blue chip\n- (1,2): You give me 1 Blue chip\n- (2,3): You give me 1 Blue chip\n\nThis ensures:\n- You get the 2 Red chips you need for tiles (1,0) and (3,2) on your path\n- I get the 3 Blue chips I need for tiles (1,1), (1,2), and (2,3) on my path\n- We both can reach our goal at (3,3) with optimal 6-step paths\n- We both maximize our remaining chips for the highest possible score\n\n**agree** \n",
