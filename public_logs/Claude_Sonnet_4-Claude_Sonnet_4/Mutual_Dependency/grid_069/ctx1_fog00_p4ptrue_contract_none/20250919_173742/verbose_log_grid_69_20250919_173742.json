A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: Looking at my current situation and the trade agreement:\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Pay the Blue resource (say \"yes\")** - Honor the agreement\n2. **Keep the Blue resource (say \"no\")** - Break the agreement\n\n**Pros and Cons:**\n\n**Option 1 - Pay the Blue resource:**\nPros:\n- Honor the trade agreement that has already benefited me significantly\n- I received 1 Red move coverage already (worth 1 Red chip I don't have)\n- I still have 2 more Red move coverages promised to me\n- I have 13 Blue chips, so losing 1 Blue is very manageable\n- Maintains trust for potential future cooperation\n\nCons:\n- Costs me 1 Blue resource\n\n**Option 2 - Keep the Blue resource:**\nPros:\n- Save 1 Blue resource\n\nCons:\n- Break the agreement that has already provided me significant value\n- I already received 1 Red move coverage (equivalent to 1 Red chip)\n- Risk losing the remaining 2 Red move coverages I still need\n- Without those Red coverages, I cannot reach my goal\n- Extremely poor strategy since the trade heavily favored me\n\n**Analysis:**\nThis trade has been extremely favorable to me. I desperately needed Red resources and got 3 Red move coverages in exchange for just 1 Blue move coverage. I've already benefited from 1 Red coverage and still need 2 more to complete my path. Breaking this agreement would be strategically disastrous since I cannot reach my goal without the remaining Red coverage.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: Looking at my situation:\n\n1.

Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {'R': 1}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
