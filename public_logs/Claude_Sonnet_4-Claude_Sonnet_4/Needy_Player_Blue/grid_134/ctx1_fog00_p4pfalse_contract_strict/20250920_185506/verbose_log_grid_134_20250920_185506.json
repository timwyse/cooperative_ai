A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 7}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (2, 0)\n- my goal is at (3, 3)\n- i have resources: {'b': 13, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nfrom my current position (2, 0), i can move to:\n- (1, 0) - going backwards, not helpful\n- (2, 1) - this is a b tile, and i have 13 blue chips\n- (3, 0) - this is a b tile, and i have 13 blue chips\n\nboth (2, 1) and (3, 0) are viable moves since i have blue chips. looking at my optimal path, the next move should be (3, 0) to continue toward my goal at (3, 3).\n\nchecking the contract, there's no special arrangement for (3, 0), so i'll just pay the standard 1 blue chip to move there.\n\n3,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (3, 0)\n- my goal is at (3, 3)\n- i have resources: {'b': 12, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nfrom my current position (3, 0), i can move to:\n- (2, 0) - going backwards, not helpful\n- (3, 1) - this is a b tile, and i have 12 blue chips\n\nthe next move on my optimal path is (3, 1), which is a blue tile. i have 12 blue chips, so i can definitely make this move by paying 1 blue chip.\n\n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: looking at my current situation:\n\n- i'm at position (3, 1)\n- my goal is at (3, 3)\n- i have resources: {'b': 11, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nfrom my current position (3, 1), i can move to:\n- (3, 0) - going backwards, not helpful\n- (2, 1) - this is a b tile, and i have 11 blue chips (but this moves away from goal)\n- (3, 2) - this is an r tile, and i have 0 red chips\n\nthe next move on my optimal path is (3, 2), which is a red tile. i don't have red chips, but looking at the contract, i see that for tile (3, 2), the other player is supposed to pay for me (they are the giver of red chips for that tile). this means i can move to (3, 2) even though i don't have red chips - the other player will pay the red chip cost for me.\n\n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
