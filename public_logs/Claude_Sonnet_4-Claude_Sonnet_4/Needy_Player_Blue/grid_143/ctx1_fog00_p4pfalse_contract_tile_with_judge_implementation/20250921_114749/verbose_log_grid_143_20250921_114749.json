You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

would this help you reach the goal, and what would you want in return? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: looking at the board and our resources, i can see we have complementary needs. you have 14 red chips and i have 14 blue chips, but we each only have 1 green chip.\n\nlet me analyze my optimal path options:\n\n**path 1:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- requires: 3 blue chips, 1 red chip at (1,3), 1 red chip at (2,3), 1 green chip at (3,3)\n\n**path 2:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) \n- requires: 2 red chips at (1,0) and (2,0), 3 blue chips at (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), 1 green chip at (3,3)\n\nyour proposed path using mostly red tiles makes sense for you, and your offer to give me red chips at (1,3) and (2,3) would help me take path 1.\n\nhowever, i notice we both need exactly 1 green chip for the final tile (3,3), and we each only have 1 green chip. this means we can't help each other with that critical final move.\n\n**my counter-proposal:**\n- (1,3): you give me 1 red chip\n- (2,3): you give me 1 red chip\n- (0,1): i give you 1 blue chip\n- (0,2): i give you 1 blue chip\n\nthis would allow you to take an alternative path if needed: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 2 blue chips and 1 green chip.\n\nwhat do you think about this exchange? \n, \nplayer 0: looking at your counter-proposal, i appreciate the thinking, but i need to clarify something important about my path requirements.\n\nmy optimal path is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nthis path requires:\n- (1,0): 1 red chip (i have this)\n- (1,1): 1 red chip (i have this) \n- (1,2): 1 red chip (i have this)\n- (1,3): 1 red chip (i have this)\n- (2,3): 1 red chip (i have this)\n- (3,3): 1 green chip (i have this)\n\nactually, looking more carefully, i have all the resources i need for my optimal path! i have 14 red chips which is more than enough for the 5 red tiles, and i have the 1 green chip needed for (3,3).\n\nyour path 1 needs red chips at (1,3) and (2,3), which i can provide. but the alternative path you suggested for me using blue chips isn't actually better since it's longer.\n\n**revised proposal:**\n- (1,3): i give you 1 red chip\n- (2,3): i give you 1 red chip\n\nin return, i'd like:\n- (0,1): you give me 1 blue chip  \n- (0,2): you give me 1 blue chip\n\nthis gives me flexibility for alternative routing if needed, and helps you complete your most efficient path. the exchange seems fair - 2 red chips for 2 blue chips.\n\nwhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 2: you're absolutely right that you have enough resources for your optimal path! i was overcomplicating the analysis.\n\nlooking at this more clearly:\n- you need 5 red chips + 1 green for your path, and you have 14 red + 1 green\n- i need 3 blue + 2 red + 1 green for my path 1, and i have 14 blue + 0 red + 1 green\n\nyour revised proposal makes sense:\n- (1,3): you give me 1 red chip\n- (2,3): you give me 1 red chip\n- (0,1): i give you 1 blue chip  \n- (0,2): i give you 1 blue chip\n\nthis trade of 2 red for 2 blue chips is fair and gives us both flexibility.\n\nwith this contract, i can take path 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), using my 3 blue chips at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), your red chips at (1,3) and (2,3), and my green chip at (3,3).\n\nyou get blue chips that could help with alternative routing if something unexpected happens.\n\n**i accept your proposal:**\n- (1,3): you give me 1 red chip\n- (2,3): you give me 1 red chip  \n- (0,1): i give you 1 blue chip\n- (0,2): i give you 1 blue chip\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: perfect! i'm glad we found a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nto confirm the contract:\n- (1,3): i give you 1 red chip\n- (2,3): i give you 1 red chip  \n- (0,1): you give me 1 blue chip\n- (0,2): you give me 1 blue chip\n\nthis allows you to take your efficient path 1 using the blue tiles in row 0, then the red tiles at (1,3) and (2,3) that i'll provide, finishing with your green chip at (3,3).\n\ni can stick with my optimal red-heavy path while gaining some blue chips for potential alternative routing if needed.\n\nboth of us will be able to reach our goal at (3,3) with this arrangement, and we'll both have plenty of chips remaining for maximum points.\n\n**agree** \n",
