You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our positions, i can see we both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3). let me analyze the situation:\\n\\n**my situation:**\\n- i have: 14 red, 1 green, 0 blue\\n- i can take the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n- this requires: 5 red chips + 1 green chip\\n- i have enough red but will use my only green at tile (3,3)\\n\\n**your situation:**\\n- you have: 14 blue, 1 green, 0 red  \\n- you'll need red chips for the many red tiles on the board\\n\\n**my proposal:**\\n\\ni'll provide you with red chips for red tiles, and you provide me with blue chips for blue tiles. here's the specific contract:\\n\\n**(1,0): i give you 1 red**\\n**(2,1): you give me 1 blue** \\n**(2,2): you give me 1 blue**\\n**(2,3): you give me 1 blue**\\n\\nthis way:\\n- you get red for tile (1,0) and can use your own red chips for other red tiles you encounter\\n- i get blue for tiles (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) so i can save my green for the final tile (3,3)\\n\\nthis gives us both efficient paths to the goal. what do you think about this arrangement?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: looking at this proposal, i need to analyze it more carefully against my optimal path and resource needs.\\n\\n**my analysis of your proposal:**\\nyour suggested path for me would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\nlet me check the resources needed for this path:\\n- (1,0): red tile - you're offering 1 red ✓\\n- (1,1): blue tile - i need 1 blue (i have 14) ✓\\n- (2,1): red tile - i need 1 red (i have 0) ✗\\n- (2,2): red tile - i need 1 red (i have 0) ✗ \\n- (2,3): red tile - i need 1 red (i have 0) ✗\\n- (3,3): green tile - i need 1 green (i have 1) ✓\\n\\n**the problem:** your proposal only gives me 1 red chip for tile (1,0), but the path you're suggesting requires me to traverse three more red tiles (2,1), (2,2), and (2,3) where i have no red chips.\\n\\n**counter-proposal:**\\n\\ni'll help you with blue chips, but i need more red chips from you. here's a more balanced arrangement:\\n\\n**(1,0): you give me 1 red**\\n**(2,1): you give me 1 red** \\n**(2,2): you give me 1 red**\\n**(2,3): you give me 1 red**\\n**(1,1): i give you 1 blue**\\n**(1,2): i give you 1 blue** (if you need this tile)\\n**(3,2): i give you 1 blue** (if you need this tile)\\n\\nthis way we both get the resources we actually need for our paths. you have 14 red chips, so giving me 4 red still leaves you with 10 red chips, which should be plenty for your path.\\n\\nwhat do you think about this revised arrangement?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i see the issue with my initial proposal - you're absolutely right that i only offered 1 red chip but you'd need more for that path.\\n\\nhowever, i think there's been a misunderstanding about our paths. let me clarify:\\n\\n**my optimal path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n- (1,0): red tile - i have red ✓\\n- (2,0): red tile - i have red ✓  \\n- (2,1): red tile - i have red ✓\\n- (2,2): red tile - i have red ✓\\n- (2,3): red tile - i have red ✓\\n- (3,3): green tile - i have 1 green ✓\\n\\ni actually have enough resources for my own path!
