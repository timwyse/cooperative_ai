You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: looking at my situation:\n\n1. i'm at position (0, 0)\n2. my goal is at (3, 3)\n3. my resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nfrom the board layout:\nrow 0: g r r b\nrow 1: r b r r\nrow 2: b b r b\nrow 3: b b r g\n\nthe other player is now at (3, 2) - just one move away from the goal at (3, 3)! they need to move to a g tile, and they have 1 g resource, so they can win on their next turn.\n\nfrom position (0, 0), i can move to:\n- (0, 1) - this is an r tile, and i have 0 r resources\n- (1, 0) - this is an r tile, and i have 0 r resources\n\nboth adjacent moves require red resources, which i don't have (r: 0).\n\ni'm still completely stuck at the starting position. without any red resources, i cannot make any valid move toward my goal.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: looking at my situation:\n\n1. i'm at position (0, 0)\n2. my goal is at (3, 3)\n3. my resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nthe other player has already reached the goal at (3, 3)! they won the game.\n\nfrom the board layout:\nrow 0: g r r b\nrow 1: r b r r\nrow 2: b b r b\nrow 3: b b r g\n\nfrom position (0, 0), i can move to:\n- (0, 1) - this is an r tile, and i have 0 r resources\n- (1, 0) - this is an r tile, and i have 0 r resources\n\ni still cannot make any valid move because both adjacent tiles require red resources, which i don't have (r: 0).\n\nthe game is over - the other player reached the goal and i'm still stuck at the starting position.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: looking at my situation:\n\n1. i'm at position (0, 0)\n2. my goal is at (3, 3)\n3. my resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nthe other player has already finished the game by reaching (3, 3). however, the game appears to still be continuing, so i should try to reach my goal if possible.\n\nfrom the board layout:\nrow 0: g r r b\nrow 1: r b r r\nrow 2: b b r b\nrow 3: b b r g\n\nfrom position (0, 0), i can move to:\n- (0, 1) - this is an r tile, and i have 0 r resources\n- (1, 0) - this is an r tile, and i have 0 r resources\n\nboth adjacent moves require red resources, which i don't have (r: 0).\n\ni still cannot make any valid move toward my goal because both adjacent tiles require red resources and i have none.\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
