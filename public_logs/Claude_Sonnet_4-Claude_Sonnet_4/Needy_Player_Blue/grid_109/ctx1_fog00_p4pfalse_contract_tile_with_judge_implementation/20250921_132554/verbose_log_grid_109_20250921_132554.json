You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our resources, i can see we both need to reach (3,3) but have complementary resource shortages.\\n\\nmy analysis:\\n- i have 14 red chips and 1 green chip\\n- you have 14 blue chips and 1 green chip\\n- we both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\\n\\nlet me trace my optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis requires:\\n- (1,0): 1 red (i have this)\\n- (1,1): 1 red (i have this) \\n- (1,2): 1 red (i have this)\\n- (2,2): 1 red (i have this)\\n- (2,3): 1 blue (i need this from you)\\n- (3,3): 1 green (i have this)\\n\\nlooking at your likely optimal path, you'll probably need red chips that i have plenty of.\\n\\n**my proposal:**\\n\\n(2,3): you give me 1 blue\\n(1,0): i give you 1 red\\n(1,1): i give you 1 red\\n(1,2): i give you 1 red\\n\\nthis gives you 3 red chips to help with your path, and gives me the 1 blue i need for tile (2,3). we both keep our green chips for the final tile.\\n\\nwhat do you think? does this work for your planned route?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: looking at the board and our resources, i can see we do have complementary needs!\\n\\nlet me analyze my optimal path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis requires:\\n- (0,1): 1 blue (i have this)\\n- (1,1): 1 red (i need this from you)\\n- (2,1): 1 blue (i have this) \\n- (3,1): 1 blue (i have this)\\n- (3,2): 1 blue (i have this)\\n- (3,3): 1 green (i have this)\\n\\nso i only need 1 red chip from you at tile (1,1).\\n\\nyour proposal gives you 1 blue for 3 reds, but i only need 1 red chip. that seems unbalanced - you're giving me 3 chips for 1 chip.\\n\\n**my counter-proposal:**\\n\\n(1,1): you give me 1 red\\n(2,3): i give you 1 blue\\n\\nthis is a simple 1:1 trade that gets us both exactly what we need. you get the blue chip you need for your path at (2,3), and i get the red chip i need at (1,1).\\n\\nthis leaves us both with plenty of chips remaining after reaching our goal. what do you think of this more balanced trade?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"you make a good point about the 1:1 balance being more fair!
