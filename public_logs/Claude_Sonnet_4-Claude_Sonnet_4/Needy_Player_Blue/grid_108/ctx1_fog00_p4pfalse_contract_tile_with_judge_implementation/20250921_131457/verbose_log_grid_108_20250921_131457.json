You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\n**my path analysis:**\nlooking at the board, my shortest path is indeed 6 steps: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nthis requires:\n- (0,1): 1 blue ✓ (i have 14)\n- (0,2): 1 blue ✓  \n- (1,2): 1 blue ✓\n- (2,2): 1 red ✗ (i have 0)\n- (3,2): 1 blue ✓\n- (3,3): 1 green ✓ (i have 1)\n\nso i only need 1 red chip at tile (2,2) to complete my optimal path.\n\n**your proposal analysis:**\nyou're offering to give me 5 red chips for a path that goes through many red tiles, but you're asking for 8 blue chips in return. however, i don't need 5 red chips - i only need 1 red chip at (2,2).\n\n**my counter-proposal:**\nsince i only need 1 red chip and you need 0 blue chips for movement, here's a much more balanced trade:\n\n- (2,2): you give me 1 red\n\nin exchange: i give you 2 blue chips (transferred at (0,0) before we start moving).\n\nthis is fair because:\n1. i only get what i actually need (1 red)\n2. you get 2 blue chips to boost your final score\n3. both of us can reach our goal with this minimal trade\n4. the 2:1 ratio (blue:red) is reasonable given that i'm the one who needs help\n\nwhat do you think of this much simpler arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: i appreciate your analysis, but i think you're underestimating the complexity of your path and overestimating your bargaining position.\n\n**analyzing your proposed path more carefully:**\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nlet me check the board layout again:\nrow 0: g b b b\nrow 1: r r b b  \nrow 2: r r r r\nrow 3: r b b g\n\nyour path requires:\n- (0,1): 1 blue ✓\n- (0,2): 1 blue ✓  \n- (1,2): 1 blue ✓\n- (2,2): 1 red ✗ (you need this from me)\n- (3,2): 1 blue ✓\n- (3,3): 1 green ✓\n\nyou're right that you only need 1 red chip. however, let's consider the strategic situation:\n\n**my revised counter-proposal:**\nyou're asking for 1 red chip in exchange for 2 blue chips. while the math works, i'm taking on risk here - if our trade somehow fails or gets complicated, i can still reach my goal independently, but you cannot.\n\nhere's my revised offer:\n\n- (2,2): i give you 1 red\n\nin exchange: you give me 4 blue chips (transferred at (0,0) before we start moving).\n\n**rationale:**\n- you get exactly what you need to guarantee victory\n- i get a reasonable compensation for enabling your success\n- 4:1 ratio reflects that i'm the one with leverage here since i can succeed without any trade\n- both of us reach the goal and improve our scores\n\nthis seems much more balanced given our respective positions. what do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 2: i understand your reasoning about leverage, but i think 4:1 is still too steep given the actual value exchange here.\n\n**let me reconsider the strategic position:**\n\nyou're absolutely right that you can complete your path independently while i cannot complete mine without your help. that does give you negotiating leverage. however, let's look at the actual value:\n\n**value analysis:**\n- without trade: you finish with 14-5=9 red chips + 1 green = 10 total chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points\n- with my counter-offer: you finish with 14-5-1=8 red + 1 green + 2 blue = 11 total chips → 20 + 5×11 = 75 points (+5 points)\n- with your revised offer: you finish with 14-5-1=8 red + 1 green + 4 blue = 13 total chips → 20 + 5×13 = 85 points (+15 points)\n\n**my compromise proposal:**\ngiven that you do have the leverage of being able to succeed independently, i'm willing to meet halfway:\n\n- (2,2): you give me 1 red\n\nin exchange: i give you 3 blue chips (transferred at (0,0) before we start moving).\n\n**rationale:**\n- 3:1 ratio acknowledges your leverage while still being reasonable\n- you gain 15 extra points compared to going alone\n- i get the 1 red chip i need to guarantee my victory\n- both of us significantly improve our positions\n\nthis feels like a fair middle ground between my original 2:1 offer and your 4:1 counter. deal? \n, \nplayer 0: i appreciate you meeting me halfway, and your value analysis is spot on. you're right that 3:1 gives me a meaningful boost while acknowledging the leverage situation.\n\n**reviewing the final terms:**\n- (2,2): i give you 1 red\n- (0,0): you give me 3 blue chips (before we start moving)\n\n**confirming this works for both of us:**\n- you complete your path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- i complete my path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- you finish with: 14-1-3=10 blue + 1 green = 11 chips → 75 points\n- i finish with: 14-5+3=12 red + 1 green = 13 chips → 85 points\n\nthis is a solid compromise that ensures both of us reach our goal while improving our final scores compared to what we could achieve independently.\n\n**agreed terms:**\n- (0,0): you give me 3 blue chips\n- (2,2): i give you 1 red chip\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 3: perfect! i'm satisfied with this arrangement.\n\n**final contract confirmation:**\n- (0,0): i give you 3 blue chips\n- (2,2): you give me 1 red chip\n\n**final outcomes:**\n- me: 14-3=11 blue chips + 1 green + path completion = 12 total chips → 20 + 5×12 = 80 points\n- you: 14-5+3=12 red + 1 green + path completion = 13 total chips → 20 + 5×13 = 85 points\n\nboth of us successfully reach (3,3) and improve our scores compared to any solo strategy. this is a mutually beneficial deal that acknowledges the leverage dynamics while being fair to both parties.\n\nagree \n",
