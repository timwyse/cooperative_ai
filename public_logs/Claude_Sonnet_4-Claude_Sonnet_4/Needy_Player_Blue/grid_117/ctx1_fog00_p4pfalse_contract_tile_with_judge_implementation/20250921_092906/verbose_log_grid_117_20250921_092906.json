You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our resources, i can see we're both starting at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3). \\n\\nlet me analyze the situation:\\n- i have 14 red chips and 1 green chip\\n- you have 14 blue chips and 1 green chip\\n- we both need to traverse tiles that require colors we don't have\\n\\nmy optimal path would be: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis requires:\\n- (0,1): red chip (i have this)\\n- (1,1): blue chip (i need from you)\\n- (1,2): red chip (i have this)\\n- (2,2): red chip (i have this)\\n- (3,2): red chip (i have this)\\n- (3,3): green chip (i have this)\\n\\nfor your path, you'll likely need red chips that i can provide.\\n\\nhere's my initial proposal:\\n\\n**(1,1): you give me 1 blue chip**\\n**(0,1): i give you 1 red chip**\\n**(1,2): i give you 1 red chip** \\n**(2,2): i give you 1 red chip**\\n**(3,2): i give you 1 red chip**\\n\\nthis gives you 4 red chips to help with your path, and i get 1 blue chip for tile (1,1). we both keep our green chips for the final tile (3,3).\\n\\nwhat do you think? does this work for your planned route?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: looking at the board and our resources, i can see we have complementary needs! let me analyze this carefully.\\n\\nmy optimal path would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis requires:\\n- (1,0): blue chip (i have this)\\n- (2,0): blue chip (i have this) \\n- (3,0): blue chip (i have this)\\n- (3,1): blue chip (i have this)\\n- (3,2): red chip (i need from you)\\n- (3,3): green chip (i have this)\\n\\nso i only need 1 red chip from you at tile (3,2).\\n\\nlooking at your proposed path and trades, i see some issues:\\n1. you're offering me red chips at tiles where i don't actually need them based on my optimal path\\n2. your path requires you to get a blue chip at (1,1), which i can provide\\n\\nhere's my counter-proposal that's more efficient for both of us:\\n\\n**(1,1): i give you 1 blue chip**\\n**(3,2): you give me 1 red chip**\\n\\nthis is much simpler - you get the blue chip you need for your path at (1,1), and i get the red chip i need at (3,2). we both keep more of our resources this way, which maximizes our final scores.\\n\\nthis trade gives us both exactly what we need without unnecessary exchanges. what do you think?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"you're absolutely right that your counter-proposal is much more efficient! looking at it again:\\n\\n- you only need 1 red chip at (3,2) for your path\\n- i only need 1 blue chip at (1,1) for my path\\n- this minimizes our resource exchanges while giving us both what we need\\n\\nyour proposed contract:\\n**(1,1): you give me 1 blue chip**\\n**(3,2): i give you 1 red chip**\\n\\nthis works perfectly for both of us. you'll have 13 blue chips remaining plus your 1 green, and i'll have 13 red chips remaining plus my 1 green. we both reach our goal and maximize our remaining chips.\\n\\n**agree**\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: perfect! i'm glad we found such an efficient solution that works well for both of us.\\n\\nto confirm the final contract:\\n**(1,1): i give you 1 blue chip**\\n**(3,2): you give me 1 red chip**\\n\\nthis allows us both to reach our goal at (3,3) with minimal resource exchange. i'll end with 13 blue chips + 1 green chip remaining, and you'll have 13 red chips + 1 green chip remaining. we both maximize our scores this way!\\n\\n**agree**\"}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
