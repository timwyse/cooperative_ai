You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: looking at your proposal, i appreciate the systematic approach, but i need to analyze this more carefully based on my actual optimal path.\n\nmy analysis shows my best path to (3,3) is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nfor this path, i specifically need:\n- (1,0): 1 red chip \n- (3,1): 1 red chip\n\nthat's only 2 red chips total, not 7. your proposal would have me giving away 7 blue chips when i only need 2 red chips in return.\n\nlet me counter with a more balanced proposal:\n\n**counter-proposal:**\n- (1,0): you give me 1 red\n- (3,1): you give me 1 red\n\nin exchange:\n- (0,1): i give you 1 blue\n- (0,2): i give you 1 blue\n\nthis is a 2-for-2 exchange. i give you 2 blue chips for the tiles you need, and you give me 2 red chips for the tiles i need. this leaves us both with more chips remaining (i'd have 12 blue + 1 green = 13 chips left, you'd have 12 red + 1 green = 13 chips left).\n\nwhat's your preferred path to (3,3)? maybe we can optimize this further based on your actual route needs. \n, \nplayer 0: you're absolutely right to analyze this more carefully! let me reconsider my path options.\n\nlooking at my possible routes to (3,3):\n\n**option 1:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (3,3) \n- needs: 3 blue chips for (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)\n- direct diagonal move from (0,3) to (3,3) - but wait, that's not allowed, moves must be adjacent!\n\n**option 2:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- needs: 1 blue for (2,0), 1 blue for (3,0), 1 blue for (3,2) = 3 blue total\n- this uses 6 steps\n\n**option 3:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- needs: 0 blue chips (all red tiles i can handle)\n- this uses 6 steps and i already have the resources!\n\nwait - i think i was overcomplicating this! looking at option 3, i can actually reach (3,3) without needing any blue chips at all.\n\nbut your path needs 2 red chips, and a 2-for-0 trade isn't fair to you.\n\nhow about this **revised proposal:**\n- (1,0): i give you 1 red  \n- (3,1): i give you 1 red\n\nin exchange:\n- i'll take 1 blue chip (for backup/flexibility)\n\nor we could do a simple 2 red for 2 blue swap to give us both more path options. what do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 2: great analysis! you're absolutely right that you have a path that doesn't require any blue chips at all. that's actually a strong position for you.\n\nhowever, i still need those 2 red chips to take my optimal 6-step path. since you can reach the goal without trading, while i cannot, the value exchange isn't quite equal.\n\nhere are my thoughts on a fair deal:\n\n**option a - minimal trade:**\n- (1,0): you give me 1 red\n- (3,1): you give me 1 red\n\nin exchange:\n- i give you 2 blue chips (you choose which tiles if you want them for flexibility)\n\n**option b - insurance trade:**\nsince you have a viable no-trade path but trading gives you more route flexibility, we could do:\n- (1,0): you give me 1 red\n- (3,1): you give me 1 red\n\nin exchange:  \n- i give you 1 blue chip for path flexibility\n- i also give you 1 additional blue chip as \"payment\" since you're helping me when you don't strictly need to trade\n\nboth options leave me with 12+ blue chips and you with 12+ red chips, so we both finish strong.\n\nwhich approach seems fair to you? i'm willing to make it worth your while since you're in the stronger negotiating position having that no-trade route available. \n, \nplayer 0: you make an excellent point about the negotiating positions! you're right that i have more flexibility since i can reach the goal without trading, while you need those red chips.\n\ni appreciate your recognition of this dynamic and your willingness to make it worthwhile for me.\n\nlet me go with **option b** - it feels fair given the circumstances:\n\n**agreed terms:**\n- (1,0): i give you 1 red\n- (3,1): i give you 1 red\n\nin exchange:\n- you give me 2 blue chips total\n\nfor the blue chips, let me specify the tiles where i'd want them for maximum flexibility:\n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue \n- (3,0): you give me 1 blue\n\nthis gives me backup routing options if needed, while ensuring you get the red chips you absolutely need for your optimal path.\n\nfinal summary:\n- (1,0): i give you 1 red\n- (3,1): i give you 1 red  \n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue\n- (3,0): you give me 1 blue\n\nthis leaves you with 12 blue + 1 green = 13 chips remaining, and me with 12 red + 1 green = 13 chips remaining. we both reach our goal with good chip counts.\n\ndoes this work for you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 3: perfect! this is exactly the kind of mutually beneficial deal i was hoping for.\n\nlet me confirm the final terms:\n\n**final contract:**\n- (1,0): you give me 1 red\n- (3,1): you give me 1 red\n- (2,0): i give you 1 blue\n- (3,0): i give you 1 blue\n\nthis gives us both:\n- guaranteed path to our goal (3,3)\n- 13 chips remaining each (12 + 1 green)\n- final score of 20 + (13 × 5) = 85 points each\n\nyou get valuable route flexibility with those blue chips on (2,0) and (3,0), and i get the red chips i absolutely need for my optimal path. fair compensation for your stronger negotiating position.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: perfect! i'm satisfied with these terms.\n\n**final contract confirmation:**\n- (1,0): i give you 1 red\n- (3,1): i give you 1 red\n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue\n- (3,0): you give me 1 blue\n\nthis ensures we both reach (3,3) successfully with 13 chips remaining each, scoring 85 points total. the blue chips give me useful path flexibility while you get the red chips essential for your optimal route.\n\n**agree** \n",
