You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"looking at the board and our resources, i can see we're both starting at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3). \\n\\nlet me analyze the situation:\\n- i have 14 red chips and 1 green chip\\n- you have 14 blue chips and 1 green chip\\n- we both need to traverse a mix of red, blue, and green tiles\\n\\nlooking at my optimal path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis requires:\\n- (0,1): red chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (1,1): blue chip ✗ (i have 0)\\n- (2,1): red chip ✓ (i have plenty) \\n- (3,1): blue chip ✗ (i have 0)\\n- (3,2): red chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (3,3): green chip ✓ (i have 1)\\n\\ni need 2 blue chips from you. in return, i can provide red chips for your journey.\\n\\n**my proposal:**\\n\\n(1,1): you give me a blue\\n(3,1): you give me a blue\\n(0,1): i give you a red\\n(2,1): i give you a red\\n(3,2): i give you a red\\n\\nthis gives you 3 red chips for 2 blue chips, which seems fair since i'm giving you an extra red. this would allow us both to take efficient 6-step paths to the goal.\\n\\nwhat do you think?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: looking at your proposal, i can see you've thought this through, but i need to analyze this more carefully for my optimal path.\\n\\nlet me examine my best route options:\\n\\nmy optimal path is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nthis requires:\\n- (1,0): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (2,0): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty)  \\n- (3,0): blue chip ✓ (i have plenty)\\n- (3,1): red chip ✗ (i have 0)\\n- (3,2): red chip ✗ (i have 0)\\n- (3,3): green chip ✓ (i have 1)\\n\\nso i need exactly 2 red chips from you.\\n\\nyour proposed path gives you a good route, but i notice you're offering me 3 red chips when i only need 2, and asking for 2 blue chips in return.\\n\\n**my counter-proposal:**\\n\\n(3,1): i give you a blue chip\\n(1,1): i give you a blue chip  \\n(3,1): you give me a red chip\\n(3,2): you give me a red chip\\n\\nthis is a more balanced 2-for-2 trade that gives us each exactly what we need for our optimal paths. you still get your efficient 6-step route, and i get mine with no wasted resources.\\n\\nwhat do you think of this more streamlined approach?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i see the logic in your counter-proposal, but i think there might be a small error in how you've written it. you've listed (3,1) twice - once for you giving me a blue chip and once for me giving you a red chip. \\n\\nlet me clarify what i think you meant:\\n\\n**(1,1): you give me a blue chip**\\n**(3,1): you give me a blue chip**  \\n**(3,1): i give you a red chip**\\n**(3,2): i give you a red chip**\\n\\nbut wait - this has both of us needing resources at (3,1). that could be problematic since we might arrive there at different times.\\n\\nlooking at your path more carefully: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\ni think you meant:\\n**(1,1): you give me a blue chip**\\n**(3,1): you give me a blue chip**  \\n**(3,1): i give you a red chip** (for when you reach (3,1))\\n**(3,2): i give you a red chip** (for when you reach (3,2))\\n\\nthis 2-for-2 trade works for me!
