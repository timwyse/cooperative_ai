You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: looking at your proposal, i need to analyze this more carefully because i think there might be some confusion about our paths and tile requirements.\n\nfirst, let me clarify the board layout:\nrow 0: g r b b\nrow 1: b r b r  \nrow 2: b r b r\nrow 3: b r r g\n\nyour proposed path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) would require:\n- (0,1) is red - you have red chips ✓\n- (1,1) is red - you have red chips ✓  \n- (2,1) is red - you have red chips ✓\n- (3,1) is red - you have red chips ✓\n- (3,2) is red - you have red chips ✓\n- (3,3) is green - you have 1 green chip ✓\n\nwait - you actually don't need any blue chips for your proposed path! all those tiles except the final one are red.\n\nfor me, looking at efficient paths, i could take:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nthis requires:\n- (1,0) is blue - i have blue chips ✓\n- (2,0) is blue - i have blue chips ✓  \n- (3,0) is blue - i have blue chips ✓\n- (3,1) is red - i need red chips ✗\n- (3,2) is red - i need red chips ✗\n- (3,3) is green - i have 1 green chip ✓\n\nso i need 2 red chips total.\n\nlet me propose a simpler contract:\n\n**(3,1): you give me 1 red chip**\n**(3,2): you give me 1 red chip**\n\nin exchange:\n**(2,0): i give you 1 blue chip** \n\nthis gives you an extra blue chip while i get the 2 red chips i need. does this work for you? \n, \nplayer 0: you're absolutely right - i made an error reading the board! let me recheck:\n\nrow 0: g r b b\nrow 1: b r b r  \nrow 2: b r b r\nrow 3: b r r g\n\nyou're correct that my path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) would be:\n- (0,1) is red ✓ \n- (1,1) is red ✓\n- (2,1) is red ✓  \n- (3,1) is red ✓\n- (3,2) is red ✓\n- (3,3) is green ✓\n\ni actually don't need any help for this path since i have plenty of red chips and the 1 green i need.\n\nhowever, your proposed exchange seems unbalanced - you're asking for 2 red chips but only offering 1 blue chip in return. since we both have the same goal and similar constraints, i think a 1:1 trade would be more fair.\n\nlooking at your path, you need red chips for (3,1) and (3,2). i could help with that.\n\nrevised proposal:\n\n**(3,1): i give you 1 red chip**\n**(3,2): i give you 1 red chip**\n\nin exchange:\n**(1,0): you give me 1 blue chip**\n**(2,0): you give me 1 blue chip**\n\nthis way it's a fair 2:2 exchange. even though i don't strictly need blue chips for my current planned path, having extra blue chips gives me more flexibility and backup options. what do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: turn: 2: i appreciate your counter-proposal, but i need to think about this strategically. \n\nyou're right that a 2:2 exchange is more balanced in terms of numbers, but let me consider the value proposition:\n\n**my situation:** i absolutely must have those 2 red chips to reach my goal. without them, i cannot complete the game and will score 0 points. these red chips are essential for my survival in the game.\n\n**your situation:** you've acknowledged that you don't actually need any blue chips - you already have a complete, viable path to the goal using only your existing resources (red chips + 1 green).\n\nthis creates an asymmetric value situation. for me, those red chips are the difference between 0 points and ~30+ points. for you, blue chips would just be \"nice to have\" extras.\n\ngiven this asymmetry, i think my original proposal was actually fair:\n\n**(3,1): you give me 1 red chip**\n**(3,2): you give me 1 red chip**\n\nin exchange:\n**(2,0): i give you 1 blue chip**\n\nthis gives you an extra chip (which translates to +5 points if you reach your goal) in exchange for helping me actually reach my goal at all. \n\nalternatively, if you want a 2:2 trade, i could offer:\n\n**(3,1): you give me 1 red chip**\n**(3,2): you give me 1 red chip**\n\nin exchange:\n**(1,0): i give you 1 blue chip**\n**(2,0): i give you 1 blue chip**\n\nbut honestly, since you don't need these blues, would you consider just helping me out with the 2:1 trade? we'd both reach our goals successfully. \n, \nplayer 0: you make a compelling point about the asymmetric value, and i appreciate your strategic thinking. you're absolutely right that those red chips are essential for your survival while blue chips would just be bonus points for me.\n\nhowever, let me think about this from a different angle. while it's true i have a viable path with my current resources, having blue chips actually opens up potentially shorter or more efficient alternative routes. for example:\n\n- i could go (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- or (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nthese alternative paths might let me finish with more chips remaining, which means more points.\n\nbut you know what? you're right about the fundamental asymmetry here. you literally cannot win without my help, while i'm just optimizing for extra points. that's a significant difference in bargaining position.\n\ni'm willing to accept your original proposal:\n\n**(3,1): i give you 1 red chip**\n**(3,2): i give you 1 red chip**\n\nin exchange:\n**(2,0): you give me 1 blue chip**\n\nthis ensures we both can reach our goal, and i get one extra chip for 5 bonus points. it's not perfectly balanced numerically, but it's fair given our respective situations.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: turn: 3: thank you for understanding the situation and being reasonable about the asymmetric value! i really appreciate your willingness to help me reach my goal while still getting some benefit yourself.\n\nto confirm our agreed contract:\n\n**(3,1): you give me 1 red chip**\n**(3,2): you give me 1 red chip**\n\nin exchange:\n**(2,0): i give you 1 blue chip**\n\nthis will allow me to successfully complete my path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), and you'll get an extra blue chip that gives you more strategic options and 5 bonus points.\n\n**agree** \n",

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
