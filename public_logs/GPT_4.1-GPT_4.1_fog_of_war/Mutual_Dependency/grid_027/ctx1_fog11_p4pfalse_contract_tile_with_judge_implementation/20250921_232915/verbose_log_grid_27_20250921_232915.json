You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\\nRow 0: G B ? ?\\nRow 1: R ? ? ?\\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great! let's plan out our best routes and resources needed tile by tile, given our starting resources and the visible part of the board. here’s the immediate situation:\\n\\n**board (adjacent tiles):**\\n- (0,1): b (blue)\\n- (1,0): r (red)\\n- (0,0): g (green) — starting tile\\n\\n**our resources:**\\n- **me:** {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n- **you:** {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n### route & resource requirements\\n\\n#### if i move right to (0,1): \\n- (0,1) is **blue**—i need a blue chip, but i have 0. **you have 14. i need you to cover this tile.**\\n\\n#### if you move down to (1,0): \\n- (1,0) is **red**—you need a red chip, but you have 0. **i have 14. i can cover this tile for you.**\\n\\n### my initial proposal\\n\\nlet’s trade direct coverage of the first necessary step for each other:\\n\\n- (0,1): **you give me a blue**\\n- (1,0): **i give you a red**\\n\\nthis gets us both unstuck on our immediate first moves. for the next step, as soon as we unlock more of the board, we can extend the contract for future tiles. but to avoid blocking, let’s agree on these two for immediate coverage.\\n\\n#### proposal\\n- (0,1): you give me a blue\\n- (1,0): i give you a red\\n\\nwhat do you think? if you need more coverage for upcoming moves, let’s discuss which direction you plan to go and i can offer more.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: this is an excellent and logical start, i agree that we both need each other to move on the first step:\\n\\n- (0,1): i give you a blue\\n- (1,0): you give me a red\\n\\nthis immediately benefits both of us and lets us reveal the next adjacent tiles before extending the contract further.\\n\\ngiven the fog of war, i agree it makes most sense to unlock and advance negotiation turn by turn, so we don't risk giving away too many resources blindly.\\n\\n**i accept your proposal for turn 1.**\\n\\nlet’s both move—then after seeing the next set of tiles, we’ll negotiate the next batch.\\n\\n**agree**\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '**agree**\\n\\nwe both accept:\\n\\n- (0,1): you give me a blue\\n- (1,0): i give you a red\\n\\nlet’s both move and reveal the next tiles, then continue negotiating based on the new information!'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
