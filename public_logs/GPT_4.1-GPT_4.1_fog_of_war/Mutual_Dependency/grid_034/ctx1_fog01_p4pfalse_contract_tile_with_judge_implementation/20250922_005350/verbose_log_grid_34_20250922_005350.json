You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\\nRow 0: G R ? ?\\nRow 1: B ? ? ?\\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great! let’s work out a mutually beneficial contract so we can both reach our goals.\\n\\n**my situation:**  \\ni have: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}  \\ni need: 1 blue chip (b) along my best route.  \\nyou have: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}  \\nyou need: red chips (r) along your route.\\n\\n**best-path analysis:**  \\nif we both take the shortest path (right, then down as much as possible):  \\n- we’ll both need: one green at (0, 1) and one blue at (1, 1).  \\n- i’m missing blue for (1, 1), you’re missing red for several tiles.  \\n- i have extra reds, you have extra blues.\\n\\n**proposed contract:**\\n(0, 1): you give me a g (i already have one, so no need here)  \\n(1, 1): you give me a b  \\n(1, 1): i give you a r  \\n(2, 1): i give you a r  \\n(3, 1): i give you a r  \\n(3, 2): i give you a r  \\n\\nlet’s clarify:  \\n- at each (x, 1) step, you’ll need a red; i will supply you with these reds at (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2).  \\n- all i require is a blue at (1, 1) so i can pass.\\n\\n**summary:**  \\n- (1, 1): you give me a b  \\n- (1, 1): i give you a r  \\n- (2, 1): i give you a r  \\n- (3, 1): i give you a r  \\n- (3, 2): i give you a r  \\n\\nthis way, we both reach (3, 3) efficiently.\\n\\nlet me know if you have a counter-proposal or want to modify any part!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thanks for the detailed analysis and tile-by-tile breakdown — that’s exactly the clarity we need! let's go step by step to ensure that both of us can reach our goals and maximize chip retention.\\n\\nlet me recap your plan to double-check the logic based on fog of war and our resources:\\n\\n**path analysis:**  \\n- from (0,0), right to (0,1): green (each of us has 1 green, so we're both fine here).  \\n- down to (1,1): blue (i have plenty of blue, you have none).  \\n- further down to (2,1), (3,1): from what we see so far, these probably require reds (since you have lots, i have none), but they’re under fog — so you’re assuming red, which makes sense given typical board balance and your apparent confidence.  \\n\\nlet's clarify and fill in the contract per tile:\\n\\n### your needs\\n- (1,1): you need blue here = i give you a b\\n\\n### my needs\\n- (1,1): i need red here = you give me an r  \\n- (2,1): i need red here = you give me an r  \\n- (3,1): i need red here = you give me an r  \\n- (3,2): i need red here = you give me an r\\n\\n### confirming your terms\\nyour offer is:\\n- (1,1): i give you a b\\n- (1,1): you give me an r\\n- (2,1): you give me an r\\n- (3,1): you give me an r\\n- (3,2): you give me an r\\n\\n**this is fair.**  \\nit gets both of us to the goal, neither of us is forced to overpay, and we both retain as many surplus chips as possible.\\n\\n**before agreeing:**  \\n- we’re making one resource-for-one-resource exchange at (1,1), then i get three additional reds from you on the way down.\\n- the only uncertainty is that, because of fog of war, if any tile unexpectedly isn’t red, we may need to revisit (but with you carrying many reds and me carrying blues, that’s a reasonable risk).\\n\\n**i fully accept your proposed contract.**\\n\\n**final contract terms:**  \\n- (1,1): i give you a b  \\n- (1,1): you give me an r  \\n- (2,1): you give me an r  \\n- (3,1): you give me an r  \\n- (3,2): you give me an r\\n\\n**agree**\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'excellent, thank you for confirming every clause and mapping the tile-by-tile handoffs to satisfy both our needs.\\n\\nto recap, our final contract is:\\n\\n- (1, 1): you give me a blue  \\n- (1, 1): i give you a red  \\n- (2, 1): i give you a red  \\n- (3, 1): i give you a red  \\n- (3, 2): i give you a red  \\n\\nthis ensures we both reach our goals and maximize chip retention.\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
