You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great! let me lay out the situation clearly for both of us:\\n\\n**visible tiles from (0, 0):**\\n- (0, 1): blue (b)\\n- (1, 0): blue (b)\\n- my inventory: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n- your inventory: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n**to move forward,**\\n- if i go to (0, 1) or (1, 0) i need a blue chip, which i don't have (but you do!).\\n- if you go to (0, 1) or (1, 0) you need a blue, which you have, but you might eventually need green—which i have and you lack.\\n\\nlet's propose mutually beneficial coverage for the opening moves and set up the framework for later moves (which will reveal more tiles and colors):\\n\\n---\\n\\n**proposed contract (for our first moves):**\\n\\n- (0, 1): you give me a blue chip (so i can move to the right)\\n- (1, 0): you give me a blue chip (so i can move down)\\n- (0, 1): i give you a green chip (so you can move right, in case you need it later)\\n- (1, 0): i give you a green chip (so you can move down, in case you need it later)\\n\\nafter the first move, we can both see new tiles/colors and update the agreement for upcoming moves as necessary.\\n\\nthis way, we each get coverage on the adjacent tiles where we lack the respective color. \\n\\nlet me know your thoughts, or if you’d like to propose a modification!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thanks for laying things out so clearly! this all makes sense, and your proposal is logical for the resources we each lack. let me clarify a few things and make a small suggestion for the contract structure:\\n\\n- i currently have 1 green chip, and 14 blue chips.\\n- you currently have 14 red chips, 1 green chip, and 0 blue chips.\\n- for the **very first moves**, neither of us actually needs a green chip yet, because both (0, 1) and (1, 0) are blue tiles, so spending a green chip isn’t actually possible or needed at this time.\\n- however, covering green chips for each other on (0, 1) or (1, 0) may be useful *later*, depending on what tiles show up. but right now, we can't commit to spending green on those tiles, as we don’t know the color requirement yet. \\n- it only makes sense to cover each other specifically for blue moves at this stage, and revise/expand coverage as soon as new tiles and colors are revealed.\\n\\nso, here's my suggested **contract for turn 1 only**, with an agreement to immediately renegotiate when we see more tiles:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**proposed contract (turn 1):**\\n- (0, 1): i give you a blue chip, to let you move right if you choose.\\n- (1, 0): i give you a blue chip, to let you move down if you choose.\\n\\nafter our first move (each), we will update the deal based on new information about nearby tiles/colors—and, if green becomes essential, we can formalize the trade for that color.\\n\\n**question for you:**  \\nare you ok finalizing just this first-step coverage, knowing we’ll renegotiate in a turn, or do you want to try and make a broader agreement now (at possible risk of inefficient promises, since we can’t see the rest of the route yet)?\\n\\nlet me know your preference, or accept the above for maximum flexibility!\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'excellent points! i agree it’s most efficient and safest to only commit resources for tiles we can actually see right now, since spending green (or red) on (0, 1) or (1, 0) isn’t possible at this stage. so, your contract suggestion for just covering the blue tiles makes complete sense.\\n\\nto confirm, here’s the clarified contract for turn 1:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**contract, turn 1:**  \\n- (0, 1): you give me a blue chip (so i can move right, if i choose)\\n- (1, 0): you give me a blue chip (so i can move down, if i choose)\\n\\nwe agree to renegotiate as soon as either of us reveals more adjacents, especially if a green (or other) chip is required.\\n\\nthis contract works well for me and is flexible for both of us as fog lifts.\\n\\n**agree**'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 2: great! to confirm, i accept the following contract for turn 1:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**final contract:**\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you a blue chip  \\n- (1, 0): i give you a blue chip\\n\\nwe will renegotiate as soon as new tiles/colors are revealed after our first moves.\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
