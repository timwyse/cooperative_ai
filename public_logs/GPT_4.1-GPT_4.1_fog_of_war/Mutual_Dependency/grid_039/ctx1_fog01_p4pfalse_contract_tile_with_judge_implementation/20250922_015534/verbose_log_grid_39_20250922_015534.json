You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n[{'role': 'system', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\\n\\nObjective:\\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \\n\\nMovement rules:\\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'let’s analyze both our positions and propose something that helps us both reach our goals.\\n\\n**my position:**  \\n- start: (0, 0)  \\n- goal: (3, 3)  \\n- i lack 1 blue (b) chip to take the optimal path.\\n- i have 1 green (g), 14 red (r), 0 blue (b).\\n\\n**your position:**  \\n- start: (0, 0)  \\n- goal: (3, 3)  \\n- you have 1 green (g), 14 blue (b), 0 red (r).\\n\\nwith this, we’re obviously “mirror images”—i have red, you have blue, both with 1 green.\\n\\n**best short path for both (6 steps):**  \\n**(0,0) → (0,1)[r] → (0,2)[r] → (1,2)[b] → (1,3)[r] → (2,3)[r] → (3,3)[g]**\\n\\n### my missing resource(s):  \\n- (1,2): b  \\n- i can cover all r and the single g at goal.\\n\\n### your missing resource(s) (assuming you take the mirrored best path):  \\n- (0,1): r  \\n- (0,2): r  \\n- (1,3): r  \\n- (2,3): r  \\n- (3,3): g (you have 1; so do i – so we’re both fine)\\n\\n**you have no red – you need 4 r chips for your path.**\\n\\n### proposal – mutual exchange, tile-specific:\\n**for you:**\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 r  \\n- (0,2): i give you 1 r  \\n- (1,3): i give you 1 r  \\n- (2,3): i give you 1 r  \\n\\n**for me:**\\n- (1,2): you give me 1 b  \\n\\nthis gets us both to (3,3) on the shortest path.  \\neach of us covers the tile where we lack resources; we both retain as many chips as possible, maximizing end-game points.\\n\\n#### formal contract proposal:\\n- (0,1): i give you a red\\n- (0,2): i give you a red\\n- (1,3): i give you a red\\n- (2,3): i give you a red\\n- (1,2): you give me a blue\\n\\nyou cover your own movement for the rest (incl. final green); i cover mine.\\n\\nplease review and let me know if you accept or want to modify/clarify the contract!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thank you for outlining the path and the clear, tile-by-tile breakdown! i agree your analysis is thorough and accurate given our current visibility.\\n\\n### double-checking path based on visible tiles:\\n- (0,0) → (0,1)[r] → (0,2)[r] → (1,2)[b] → (1,3)[r] → (2,3)[r] → (3,3)[g]\\n  - you: need 1 blue at (1,2), reds and green are good.\\n  - me: need 4 reds at (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (2,3). i have 14 blue, 0 red, 1 green.\\n\\n### your contract proposal:\\n> (0,1): you give me a red  \\n> (0,2): you give me a red  \\n> (1,3): you give me a red  \\n> (2,3): you give me a red  \\n> (1,2): i give you a blue\\n\\nthis matches our resource strengths and covers every step where the other is lacking.\\n\\n#### double-check: you give me reds at each red; i give you a blue at the blue on your route.\\n\\n### i have no further changes.  \\ni accept your contract as written:\\n\\n(row, 1): you give me a red  \\n(row, 2): you give me a red  \\n(1, 3): you give me a red  \\n(2, 3): you give me a red  \\n(1, 2): i give you a blue\\n\\nwe each move efficiently and maximize points. if you confirm this wording, i'm ready to agree.  \\n**agree**\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'excellent—thank you for confirming and being thorough!\\n\\nto restate, here is our final agreed contract (for the judge):\\n\\n**final contract:**\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you a red  \\n- (0, 2): i give you a red  \\n- (1, 3): i give you a red  \\n- (2, 3): i give you a red  \\n- (1, 2): you give me a blue\\n\\nall other steps, each player covers their own cost.\\n\\ni confirm: **agree**'}]\n\n\n2.
