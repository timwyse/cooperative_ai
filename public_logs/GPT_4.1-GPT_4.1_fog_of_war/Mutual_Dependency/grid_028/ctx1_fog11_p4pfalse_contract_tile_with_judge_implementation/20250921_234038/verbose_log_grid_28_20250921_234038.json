You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze our positions and what we each need:\\n\\n### what we can see right now (adjacent tiles):\\n- (0, 1): r (red)\\n- (1, 0): b (blue)\\n\\n### our resources\\n- **my resources:** {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n- **your resources:** {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n### initial assessment\\n- i am rich in red, you are rich in blue. \\n- the shortest paths to our mutual goal (3, 3) will likely require both blue and red (and potentially green, but each of us has only 1 green).\\n- we both need to collaborate: i will need blue chips from you, and you will need red chips from me.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### immediate options\\nfrom (0,0):\\n- to (1,0): costs blue; i need you to pay or give me blue to go here.\\n- to (0,1): costs red; you need me to pay or give you red to go here.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### proposal – turn-by-turn collaboration (first two moves):\\n\\n#### contract proposal\\n\\n- (0, 1): **i give you 1 red**  *(so you can step right)*\\n- (1, 0): **you give me 1 blue** *(so i can step down)*\\n\\nafter this first step, we will see more tiles and can extend the deal as needed for subsequent moves.\\n\\nwould you like to agree to this starting exchange for the first move, or suggest changes/add more tiles?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: great summary and very clear proposal—thank you! i agree with your assessment and think a tile-by-tile approach is the safest given we're in fog of war.\\n\\nto be completely precise and in line with the contract requirements, here's my understanding of your offer (rephrased slightly, so we’re explicit):\\n\\n**proposed contract for the first move:**\\n\\n- (0, 1): you (user) give me (assistant) 1 red chip, so i can step right.\\n- (1, 0): i (assistant) give you (user) 1 blue chip, so you can step down.\\n\\nthis covers only our immediate next step, so after these moves we can reassess based on the new visible tiles and propose further trades if needed.\\n\\ni'm happy to accept this as our initial contract for the first moves.\\n\\n**agree**\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '**agree**\\n\\ncontract summary (fully explicit, for judge):\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you (user) 1 red chip for your move.\\n- (1, 0): you (user) give me (assistant) 1 blue chip for my move.\\n\\nthis contract covers only our moves to the immediately visible right/left tiles. we will renegotiate after the next moves as new information is revealed.'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
