You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\\nRow 0: G B ? ?\\nRow 1: R ? ? ?\\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's begin by reviewing our situation step by step. here’s the tile color info we have so far:\\n\\n**visible board:**  \\n- (0, 0): g (start)  \\n- (0, 1): b  \\n- (1, 0): r  \\n\\n**our resources:**  \\n- i have: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}  \\n- you have: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}  \\n\\n**initial analysis:**  \\n- to move right to (0, 1): costs 1 b (i can’t do this, but you can)  \\n- to move down to (1, 0): costs 1 r (i can, you can’t)\\n\\n**we are both at (0, 0). our path splits immediately, but we both need what the other has to leave this starting position.**\\n\\n----\\n\\n## my proposal:\\n\\nlet’s do a symmetric trade to help each other get out of the starting area. here’s the contract, tile by tile:\\n\\n1. **(0, 1):**  \\n   - you give me 1 b (since i have 0 b and need 1 to enter (0, 1)).  \\n\\n2. **(1, 0):**  \\n   - i give you 1 r (since you have 0 r and need 1 to enter (1, 0)).  \\n\\n**this allows each of us to move in either direction, with one turn each, and keeps the playing field fair while we reveal more tiles.**\\n\\nif you’d like to specify further tiles after we can see more, we can amend the contract later, or we can try to extend the contract based on fogged areas. \\n\\nare you okay with this start? if not, counter with your preferred tiles or terms!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: great summary! i agree, we’re in “resource mirror” positions right now:\\n\\n- i can do blue moves, but not red.\\n- you can do red moves, but not blue.\\n\\nyour contract is clear and symmetrical. here’s my understanding, formatted for contract purposes:\\n\\n**proposed contract — phase 1**\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you 1 blue chip (for your move right)  \\n- (1, 0): you give me 1 red chip (for my move down)\\n\\nthis way, each of us can unlock one direction and start revealing more tiles. we stay even and can renegotiate for future moves after we see more of the board.\\n\\n**i accept this starting contract.** if you want to add further terms or specify anything else now, let me know; otherwise, you can confirm, and we can get moving.\\n\\nagree'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'agree'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
