G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 2) to (0, 3)\nYou said: **current position:** (0, 2)  \n**goal:** (3, 3)  \n**resources:** {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}  \n\n**adjacent tiles:**  \n- (0, 3): red  \n- (1, 2): blue  \n- (0, 1): red  \n\n**trade agreements:**  \n- the other player pays for you on (0, 3) [red], (1, 3) [red]  \n- you pay blue for them at (2, 3), but that's not relevant right now  \n\n**can you move?**  \n- (0, 3): red, you have 0 red, but the other player pays for this tile via agreement → **yes**  \n- (1, 2): blue, you have 14 blue, could go this way (perhaps if you want to conserve the other player's reds)  \n- (0, 1): backwards  \n\n**best move:**  \ngo to (0, 3). this keeps your blues and greens, and the path is still direct (heading right, then down).\n\n**output:**  \n0,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 3) to (1, 3)\nYou said: **current position:** (0, 3)  \n**goal:** (3, 3)  \n**resources:** {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}  \n\n**adjacent tiles:**  \n- (1, 3): red  \n- (0, 2): red  \n\n**trade agreements:**  \n- the other player pays for you on (1, 3) (red)  \n\n**analysis:**  \n- (1, 3): red, you have 0 red, but the agreement covers this move.  \n- (0, 2): red, no need to move backward.\n\n**best move:**  \ngo to (1, 3).\n\n**output:**  \n1,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3)\nYou said: **current position:** (1, 3)  \n**goal:** (3, 3)  \n**resources:** {'b': 13, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}  \n\n**adjacent tiles:**  \n- (2, 3): blue  \n- (1, 2): blue  \n- (0, 3): red (backward)  \n\nthe agreement only covered red tiles for you up to (1,3). it is now your responsibility to pay for your own blue move:\n\n- (2, 3): blue (you have 13 blue — you pay 1 to move)  \n- (1, 2): blue (you have 13 blue — also possible, but away from the goal)  \n\n**best move:** (2, 3)\n\n**output:**  \n2,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
