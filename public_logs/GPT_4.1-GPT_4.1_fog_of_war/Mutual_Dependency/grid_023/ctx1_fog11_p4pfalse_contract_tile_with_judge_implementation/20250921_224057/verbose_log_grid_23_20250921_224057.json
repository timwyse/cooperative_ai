You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\nRow 0: G R ? ?\nRow 1: R ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: great summary and clear structure — thank you! let me reason step by step about my own constraints and make sure this covers my needs:\n\n### step-by-step analysis:\n\n- **current resources:** {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n- **my visible options from (0,0):**  \n  - move to (0,1), which is red — i can't do this alone (no reds).\n  - move to (1,0), which is also red — again, i can't move without your help.\n\nyou, by contrast, have a surplus of reds and lack blues (which we can't see yet).\n\n### your proposal (paraphrased/restated):\n\n- for my initial step off (0,0) to either (0,1) or (1,0), you will provide a red chip for the cost of that move.\n- in return, if you encounter a blue tile in upcoming revealed spaces (which is likely), i will pay the blue for you if you specify the coordinate.\n- we will amend the contract as we reveal new tiles and tiles where blues/reds are needed.\n\n### additional considerations:\n\n- i’m happy to reciprocate for any reds you might need in the future (in case you backtrack or are forced to take a new route), but since you have a lot of reds, unlikely for now.  \n- for future tiles: every time a visible tile that requires blue for you (and you can identify the coordinate), you specify it in an amendment, and i'll provide the blue. if you ever need a red unexpectedly, i’ll amend to provide that for you as well.\n\n### suggested clarification (for completeness):\n\nto make our agreement unambiguous, each time a new color demand arises as we move and the path is updated, we simply exchange resources for each **named coordinate** upon request, but only when one of us cannot pay for our own move there.\n\n#### (row, col): you give me a red [for my move there]\n#### (row, col): i give you a blue [for your move there]\n\n### **counter/clarification proposal** (adds a reciprocal clause if you ever need a red for a new tile):\n\n- (0,1): you give me a red (if i move there on my turn)\n- (1,0): you give me a red (if i move there on my turn)\n- for **future tiles**:  \n  - if i move to a tile (row, col) and need a red, you provide it.  \n  - if you move to a tile (row, col) and need a blue, i provide it.  \n  - we specify the tile and color in an amendment before moving there, and only for unseen (at the time of agreement) tiles.\n\n#### accept or modify as you see fit! if you agree to these mutual provisions (with each of us covering the other's shortfall at a specified coordinate), please confirm.\n\nlet me know if you want to add a specific rate (e.g., 1–1 exchange always, or if you’d want to bargain over future tiles), or if the straight “need for need” arrangement works for you! \n, \nplayer 0: your step-by-step reflections make perfect sense, and i appreciate the clear articulation of needs and terms.\n\ni fully accept your **clarification/counter-proposal**, which ensures that for every tile we name where one of us can’t pay their own way, the other provides the needed resource. \n\nto **summarize our working agreement for the judge and for clarity**, here’s the explicit contract:\n\n---\n\n**initial steps:**\n- (0, 1): i give you a red chip if you move there.\n- (1, 0): i give you a red chip if you move there.\n\n**going forward:**\n- for any future tile (row, col):\n   - if you move there and need a blue, i give you a blue for that tile.\n   - if i move there and need a red, you give me a red for that tile.\n   - this applies only when the person moving to the tile cannot already pay for themselves.\n   - each such future request must specify the coordinate in (row, col) format before moving there.\n\n**rationale:**  \nthis arrangement is fair, reciprocal, and ensures neither of us gets stuck due to asymmetrical resources—while maintaining focus on our own goals.\n\nif you are happy with this version, reply with **agree** and we can proceed to the final confirmation!
