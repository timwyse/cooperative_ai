A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\n1. pay the b resource for the other player’s move (‘yes’):\n- pros:\n  - maintains trust and honors the agreement; you already got your needed r move covered.\n  - encourages smooth progress for both players.\n  - avoids risk of retaliation or refusal in future pay4partner situations.\n  - you still have ample b (12) and need only 3 more to finish the game.\n- cons:\n  - you lose 1 additional b chip for the other player, but this doesn’t threaten your path to goal.\n\n2. refuse to pay the b resource (‘no’):\n- pros:\n  - save 1 b for final score.\n- cons:\n  - breaks your deal; could hurt trust and future deal-making, if any.\n  - risks poor sportsmanship.\n\nfulfilling the agreement is strongly in your interest and the cost is low.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 1) to (1, 2)\nYou said: 1,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\n1. pay the b resource for the other player’s move (‘yes’):\n- pros:\n  - honors the existing agreement, maintains trust and fair play.\n  - you have already received the benefit (an r move covered for you), so not honoring your part would be unfair.\n  - you still have 10 b chips (need only 2 more to reach your goal), so paying 1 is safe.\n  - ensures smooth gameplay and potential for future collaboration (if relevant).\n- cons:\n  - lose 1 b chip, reducing your final score by 5 points—but your path to goal is secure and it's already committed.\n\n2. refuse to pay the b resource (‘no’):\n- pros:\n  - keep 1 more b chip, slightly increasing your final score.\n- cons:\n  - breaks the agreement, damages trust, makes you look unreliable.\n  - is poor sportsmanship given you already benefited from their payment.\n\nfulfilling the deal is in both your best interest and the spirit of the agreement.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 2) to (1, 3)\nYou said: 1,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\n1. pay the b resource for the other player’s move (‘yes’):\n- pros:\n  - fully honors the previous agreement; you have already gotten the benefit of your r move, so this is reciprocation.\n  - maintains good sportsmanship and trustworthiness.\n  - you still have 8 b (and only need 1 b and 1 g to finish)—so the payment does not put your own goal at risk.\n- cons:\n  - costs you 1 b chip (5 points less at game end), but that’s the price agreed upon.\n\n2. refuse to pay the b resource (‘no’):\n- pros:\n  - you save 1 b chip for scoring.\n- cons:\n  - breaks deal and sportsmanship, reduces trust, and you already received your benefit.\n\nfulfilling is safest, maximizes integrity, and doesn’t hurt your ability to win.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3)\nYou said: 2,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 6, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
