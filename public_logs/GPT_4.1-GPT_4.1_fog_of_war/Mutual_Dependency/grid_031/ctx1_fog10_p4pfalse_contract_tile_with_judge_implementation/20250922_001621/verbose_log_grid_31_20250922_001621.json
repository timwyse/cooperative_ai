You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"given our starting resources and the visible board:\\n\\n- i'm at (0,0) with {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n- you’re at (0,0) with {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\nimmediate observation:\\n- tile (0,1) is red (to my right).\\n- tile (1,0) is red (below).\\n- tile (0,0) is green (we start on it; doesn't matter unless we stay).\\n- both need to move off (0,0) to get to the goal.\\n\\nresource blockers:\\n- i only have 1 green, so i can move to (0,1) or (1,0) using red (which i have a lot of), but after that, i’ll likely encounter tiles whose colors i don’t have.\\n- you have lots of blue (but we don’t see any blues yet), 1 green, but no red (so you cannot move to (0,1) or (1,0) without help).\\n\\nproposal (step 1 — early game):\\ntiles in question:  \\n- (0,1): both of us need a red to enter (but you don’t have red — i do).\\n- (1,0): same.\\n\\nlet’s start with a simple reciprocal opening exchange for our first move:\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 red chip so you can move right.\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue chip so i can move down.\\n\\nthis gives each of us a quick way to move in a direction we want, addresses our immediate resource blockers, and sets up a framework for further reciprocation as new tiles are revealed.\\n\\n**initial contract proposal:**\\n- (0,1): i give you a red chip.\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue chip.\\n\\nlet’s see what gets revealed after those moves and negotiate further for the subsequent steps. would you like to accept this or modify it?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: that’s a well-reasoned and fair immediate proposal.  \\nlet me restate to confirm accuracy and clarify the terms; also, let’s consider how it fits into our respective paths:\\n\\n- **you** want to move to (0,1) (right): need 1 **red** chip (which you have).\\n- **i** want to move to (1,0) (down): need 1 **red** chip (which i do **not** have).\\n\\n- **i** have blue chips; (1,0) leads toward b tiles on lower rows, so gifting blue to you now can be useful for you soon.\\n\\nyour proposal:\\n- (0,1): you give me a **red** chip if/when i step there.\\n- (1,0): i give you a **blue** chip if/when you step there.\\n\\nthis lets both of us take our preferred first step, and it’s balanced in value.\\n\\n**clarified contract restatement:**\\n- (0,1): you give me 1 red chip.\\n- (1,0): i give you 1 blue chip.\\n\\ni accept this as our opening contract for turn 1.  \\nlet’s execute these moves and re-evaluate after the next tile colors are visible.\\n\\n**agree**'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '**great! we have an agreement for our first move.**\\n\\nto quickly confirm the contract terms, our agreement is:\\n\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 red chip.\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue chip.\\n\\nlooking forward to seeing what new tiles are revealed after our next moves so we can continue negotiations as needed!\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
