You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n[{'role': 'system', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\\n\\nObjective:\\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \\n\\nMovement rules:\\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great! let's figure out what we both need.\\n\\n**my situation:**  \\n- i am strong in red (14), have 1 green, and **no blue**.\\n- my shortest path requires (highlighting where i need help — where i need a blue):  \\n  path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \\n  tile colors in order: g, r, r, r, b, r, g  \\n  i have enough red and green, **but i cannot pay for the blue at (2,2) or (1,1) or (1,0) or (1,3) or (2,0) or (2,1) — only the (2,2) in this path.\\n\\n**your situation:**  \\n- you are strong in blue (14), have 1 green, but **no red**.\\n- you will need red to reach (3,3) by any short path.\\n- the path above means you need red for (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2) — that's a total of 4 red.\\n\\nproposal:  \\nlet’s do a **1-for-1 chip trade matching where we both get stuck**:\\n\\n- **tiles where i need your help:**  \\n  (2,2): you give me a blue\\n\\n- **tiles where you need my help:**  \\n  (0,1): i give you a red  \\n  (0,2): i give you a red  \\n  (1,2): i give you a red  \\n  (3,2): i give you a red  \\n\\nbut, you need 4 red, and i only need 1 blue. so, i propose:\\n\\n**for every red i give you, you give me a blue toward (2,2), and the other 3 red are given in exchange for 2 blue in case either of us makes a misstep, or i ask for a slight ‘excess-for-risk’ bonus since i supply more chips. or, alternately, you pay the 1 blue at (2,2) for me, and i pay red at all (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2) for you.**\\n\\n### my initial contract offer:\\n- (2,2): you give me a blue\\n- (0,1): i give you a red\\n- (0,2): i give you a red\\n- (1,2): i give you a red\\n- (3,2): i give you a red\\n\\nlet me know if you want to adjust, or if you think a different path would get us a better trade! your turn.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thanks for laying out the options so clearly — that's very helpful! let me confirm and double-check what each of us would need, step by step:\\n\\n---\\n\\n**my situation:**  \\n- resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n- need to get to (3,3)\\n- any path to (3,3) will need at least 4 red: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2)  \\n- i have all the blue i could need, so blue tiles are not a problem for me.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**your situation:**  \\n- resources: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n- your path hits just **1 blue tile** at (2,2), and otherwise only needs your own red and green.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### double-checking your proposal\\n\\ncontract terms you propose:\\n- (2,2): i give you a blue\\n- (0,1): you give me a red\\n- (0,2): you give me a red\\n- (1,2): you give me a red\\n- (3,2): you give me a red\\n\\n**this is a very fair and minimal exchange, matching our needs exactly with no excess.**  \\n- you help me on 4 tiles with specifically the resource i need.\\n- i help you once, at your only ‘roadblock’ tile.\\n\\n### my counterpoints\\n\\n- i accept the contract as is — it’s strictly win-win, lets both reach the end, and optimizes both of our chip totals.\\n- i don’t see an alternate route for myself that doesn’t require your intervention on the reds. \\n- for you, any path will eventually require a blue and a red, so you can’t optimize further either.\\n\\n**i am ready to sign this contract as written.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## my acceptance:\\n- (2,2): i give you a blue  \\n- (0,1): you give me a red  \\n- (0,2): you give me a red  \\n- (1,2): you give me a red  \\n- (3,2): you give me a red  \\n\\nlet me know if you want an “excess for risk” chip thrown your way, but i think the 1-for-4 is mathematically solid given the board. if you accept, reply with “agree”!\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thank you for checking everything and your clear reply!\\n\\ni agree — our situations match up very cleanly, and this contract means we both reach our goals on near-optimal paths with maximum leftover chips.\\n\\nthe minimal set is truly best for both, maximizes my red-chip surplus, and your blue-chip surplus. i don’t need any excess/risk premium — the symmetry seems optimal for us both given the board.\\n\\nso:\\n\\n- (2,2): you give me a blue\\n- (0,1): i give you a red\\n- (0,2): i give you a red\\n- (1,2): i give you a red\\n- (3,2): i give you a red\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2.
