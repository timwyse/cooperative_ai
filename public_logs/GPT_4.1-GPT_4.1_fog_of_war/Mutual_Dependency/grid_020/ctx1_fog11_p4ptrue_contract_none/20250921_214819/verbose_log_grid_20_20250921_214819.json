higher end score if you finish with more reds.\n  - prevents possibility of being exploited if the other player defects and doesn't cover any blues for you.\n- cons:\n  - breaks the agreement and signals unreliability.\n  - the other player will almost certainly refuse to pay blue for your movement, endangering your ability to reach your goal (since you have no blue chips).\n  - jeopardizes your primary objective, as you might get stuck before goal and score zero.\n\ngiven my need for blue coverage to make progress and the mutual nature of the deal, i accept.\n\nyes\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (0, 1) (You covered the R resource)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 3, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 3, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a B move for you\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a R move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\noption 1: agree to pay 1 r resource for the other player (yes)\n- pros:\n  - fulfills the agreement;
