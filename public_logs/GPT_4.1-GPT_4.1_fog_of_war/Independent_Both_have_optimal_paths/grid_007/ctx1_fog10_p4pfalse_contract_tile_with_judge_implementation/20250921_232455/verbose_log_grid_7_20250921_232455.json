You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\nRow 0: G B ? ?\nRow 1: R ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: great analysis, and i appreciate the step-by-step breakdown!\n\nhere's what i see for the shortest/optimal path for each of us:\n- my likely optimal path: **right, right, right, down, down, down**:  \n  (0,0) → (0,1)[b] → (0,2)[b] → (0,3)[b] → (1,3)[b] → (2,3)[b] → (3,3)[g]\n\n  - i have enough blue for all blue tiles, and one green for the final destination. i do **not** need red if i go this way.\n- your likely optimal path:  \n  similar, but you don’t have any blue. so you need help with every blue tile on the best path.\n\n**your proposal** is a reasonable first step for flexibility, giving each of us both options. as you point out, it covers:\n- (0,1): i give you a blue, letting you see blue-path options\n- (1,0): you give me a red, letting me see red-path options\n\nsince i currently don’t need to use any reds (can go all blue/green), and you must get blue for nearly every step if you’re to take the shortest route, my interest would be in doing a more comprehensive contract, mapping out far enough for both players. that way, we can both guarantee we reach the goal (so neither of us risks 0 points), and maximize leftover resources.\n\n**so, here’s my proposal for a more complete coverage for you (blue tiles) in exchange for you covering any red tile i might need, should i veer off the blue path.**\n\n**draft contract:**\n- (0,1): i give you a blue\n- (0,2): i give you a blue\n- (0,3): i give you a blue\n- (1,3): i give you a blue\n- (2,3): i give you a blue\n- (3,3): i give you a green (if needed; i have the green) [or you could use your green here]\n\n**in exchange:**\n- in the event i need to move to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), or (3,2) [all \"red\" tiles], you cover those with reds for me if i ever request it.  \n(since my optimal path avoids reds entirely, but this gives me flexibility if a zigzag route turns out to be best.)\n\n**summary (contract):**\n- (0,1): i give you a blue\n- (0,2): i give you a blue\n- (0,3): i give you a blue\n- (1,3): i give you a blue\n- (2,3): i give you a blue\n- if i use any red-tile move (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), or (3,2), you give me a red.\n\nthis way, we both guarantee getting to (3,3) and maximize points, and you get to use the shortest route if you like, while i keep all my extra blue chips (after 5 used for you, and 1 green for myself).\n\nlet me know if you’d like to modify anything, or if you want to stick with the “first step only” proposal for now!
