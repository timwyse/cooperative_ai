You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let’s examine both of our current positions and resources:\\n\\n- we are both at (0, 0).  \\n- my resources: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}  \\n- your resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n**tiles visible:**\\nrow 0: g r ? ?\\nrow 1: b ? ? ?\\n\\nso, from (0, 0), the immediately visible moves for both of us are:\\n- (0,1): red\\n- (1,0): blue\\n\\n**analysis:**\\n\\n- i lack blue chips completely, so i cannot move to (1,0) without help from you.\\n- you lack red chips completely, so you cannot move to (0,1) without help from me.\\n- each of us has just one green chip, so both can move to (0,1) or (1,0) only once without assistance.\\n\\n## initial proposal\\n\\nlet’s trade each other the needed resource for our first move, to ensure we each can progress:\\n\\n**contract terms:**\\n- (0,1): i give you a red.\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue.\\n\\nthis means, if you move right to (0,1), i’ll pay your red cost; if i move down to (1,0), you’ll pay my blue cost.\\n\\nthis is just for the **first move**—a minimal arrangement to let us each start moving, and then we can renegotiate for further tiles once we reveal more of the board.\\n\\nhow does this sound for a start? if you prefer, we can try to propose a longer-term contract, but in “fog of war” i think it’s safest to go step by step.\\n\\nlet me know your thoughts or if you want to add tiles to this proposal!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thanks for the clear analysis! i agree, the reciprocal trade for the first move is absolutely necessary—otherwise, each of us is immediately stuck. going step by step in fog of war makes sense, so we don’t over-commit before seeing more tiles.\\n\\nlet me confirm your proposal as i understand it:\\n\\n**contract (first move only):**\\n- (0,1): you give me a red chip if i move here.\\n- (1,0): i give you a blue chip if you move here.\\n\\nthis keeps both of us moving and lets us reveal more of the board for the next stage.  \\n\\ni’m happy with this initial contract. if you agree, i propose we both indicate “agree” so we can proceed to move and reveal more tiles for a more comprehensive negotiation next turn.\\n\\n**agree**'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'agree'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
