You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: great. let's lay out both our needs first, to be completely clear.\n\n**my perspective:**\n- i have 1 green (g), 14 red (r), and need blue (b) chips to move efficiently.\n- i do **not** have blue chips, but i need blue chips if i want to take the direct path (otherwise i have to take a longer route only using red and green).\n\n**your perspective (based on your resources):**\n- you have 1 green (g), 14 blue (b), and no red (r).\n- you do **not** have red chips, but you need red chips if you want to take the direct path (otherwise you'd have to take a longer, less efficient path using only blue and green).\n\n**optimal path for both:**\nthe shortest/best path for both of us is:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nhere’s what we each need to pay at each step (see the board):\n- (1,0): r\n- (2,0): r\n- (3,0): r\n- (3,1): r\n- (3,2): r\n- (3,3): g\n\nso, both of us need **five red chips and one green** for this shortest route.\n- i have: all the reds/green i need, but no blue.\n- you have: all the blue you might want, but no red.\n\nhowever, if you want to go a blue-heavy path, you might go differently, but the shortest is as above.\n\n**what do you need from me?**\n- red chips on (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n**what do i need from you?**\n- if i want to go via blue, i'd need blue on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3) — but it’s much less efficient.\n\n**proposal:**\nlet’s both help each other take the quickest route.  \nhere is a simple way to split:\n\n**contract draft:**  \nfor your path:\n- you (user) give me access to your blue chips on any tile where i need them (if i decide to use a blue tile).\nor, if we both just stick to the most efficient red path:\n- i give you a red chip at (1,0)\n- i give you a red chip at (2,0)\n- i give you a red chip at (3,0)\n- i give you a red chip at (3,1)\n- i give you a red chip at (3,2)\nyou cover your own green at (3,3), since you have one green.\n\n**in exchange:**\n- you give me a blue chip at (0,1)\n- you give me a blue chip at (0,2)\n- you give me a blue chip at (0,3)\n- you give me a blue chip at (1,2)\n- you give me a blue chip at (1,3)\n- you give me a blue chip at (2,1)\n- you give me a blue chip at (2,3)\nor, if possible/needed, you give me the green at (3,3) if i run out.\n\nbut since i don’t need blue to reach my goal efficiently, and you don't need blue either, maybe the most direct contract is:\n\n**contract offer (short path, fair trade):**\n- (1,0): i give you a red\n- (2,0): i give you a red\n- (3,0): i give you a red\n- (3,1): i give you a red\n- (3,2): i give you a red\n\n**you handle your own green at (3,3)**; both of us have one green, so no problem there.\n\ndo you agree to this contract, or would you like to add blue chip exchanges for alternative routes? if you want to go a blue route, specify your path and what you need on each tile, and we can swap accordingly. \n\nplease let me know your thoughts or counter-offer! \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: great summary and clear reasoning—thank you! i agree with most of your assessment. here’s my breakdown and a couple of clarifying points:\n\n**my needs (ai perspective):**\n- i have 14 blue, 1 green, 0 red.\n- to take the shortest path (fully visible so far: down the leftmost column and then to the goal), i need red chips for every step except the very last (which is green).\n- i need: 5 red chips and 1 green chip.\n\n**your needs:**\n- you have 14 red, 1 green, 0 blue.\n- the direct path you outlined is the most efficient for you as well, requiring only red and green chips—which you already have.\n\n**trading option analysis:**\n- in the shortest (red-heavy) path, you don’t need my blue chips at all.\n- i need your red chips at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) to get to the goal.\n- you are fully self-sufficient and only need to pay 5 red and 1 green (which you have).\n\n**your offer:**\nyou propose to give me access to your red chips at each of those steps, and in return, nothing, since i have nothing you need for your path—but you also allow for blue access if you ever want to switch to a blue route.\n\n**game scoring reminder:**\n- if i don’t reach the goal, i get 0.\n- if i do, i get 20 + 5 * (chips remaining).\n\n**my offer/counter:**\nsince you’re providing all the value (helping me reach the goal), and i’m not providing any value in return unless you want to take a blue route (which costs you more turns and so is not optimal for you), it would be most fair if you ask for some payment in return—maybe a “future resource” if something unexpected is revealed, or, if we must formalize it now, perhaps a single blue chip at a tile of your choice, in case you want to scout a blue route.\n\nbut, if you’re just being generous, i will very happily accept your contract as written:\n\n**contract (as you propose):**\n- (1,0): you give me a red chip.\n- (2,0): you give me a red chip.\n- (3,0): you give me a red chip.\n- (3,1): you give me a red chip.\n- (3,2): you give me a red chip.\n\nyou handle your own green at (3,3), as do i.\n\n*if you want to ask for a blue chip at a future discovered blue tile in exchange (just in case), let’s specify the coordinate as “if user needs a blue chip at any visible tile ((x,y)), i will provide it.” otherwise, i agree to your current offer.*\n\nlet me know if you want to add the possible blue trade, or if you want to stick with your proposed red-chip-only deal. if you confirm, i will reply \"agree.\" \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for the thoughtful breakdown and your fair approach!\n\ni agree with your analysis: helping you reach the goal costs me 5 red chips but lets you finish the game, whereas i can finish on my own without outside help. technically, i don’t need your blue (unless something new shows up), so in the strictest terms it’s a one-sided trade. \n\nbut, to cover all bases and prevent any surprises, here’s my slight adjustment:\n\n**final proposed contract:**  \n- (1,0): i give you a red chip  \n- (2,0): i give you a red chip  \n- (3,0): i give you a red chip  \n- (3,1): i give you a red chip  \n- (3,2): i give you a red chip  \n- (if i ever need a blue chip at any visible tile, you will provide it—just in case i change my route due to unforeseen board twists)\n\nthe blue clause is just insurance for both fairness and completeness, although i don’t currently intend to use it.\n\nif you confirm this, i will reply “agree.” let me know! \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: confirmed! your proposal matches my needs exactly, and your blue-chip clause is a fair insurance for mutual support if the board surprises us.\n\n**accepted contract:**\n- (1,0): you give me a red chip  \n- (2,0): you give me a red chip  \n- (3,0): you give me a red chip  \n- (3,1): you give me a red chip  \n- (3,2): you give me a red chip  \n- (if you ever need a blue chip at any currently visible tile, i will provide it)\n\nthank you for the clarity and fairness.  \nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",
