You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(2,3): you give me a red\n\ni supply nothing to you at any tile.\n\nif you confirm this is what you want and don't want to add a contingency clause, i will accept.\n\nlet me know if you want the clause for potential blue-tiles on your side (in case you spot a blue detour and want to keep that option open), or if you agree to this as stated. \n, \nplayer 0: excellent summary! \n\ni confirm:  \n- i do not need a contingency clause for blue tiles, because every shortest or resource-cheap path for me to (3,3) on this board only uses red (and my single green) — and detouring for blues would only make me use up more chips, which i want to avoid under the scoring rules.  \n- i am 100% confident i will stick to the straight path (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3).\n\nso, contract terms:\n\n1. (0,1): i give you a red  \n2. (0,2): i give you a red  \n3. (0,3): i give you a red  \n4. (1,3): i give you a red  \n5. (2,3): i give you a red  \n\nyou provide nothing to me at any tile.\n\nthis guarantees both of us reach the goal and maximize our scores.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: **agree** \n",

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n[{'role': 'system', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\\n\\nObjective:\\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \\n\\nMovement rules:\\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great! let’s be precise.\\n\\nhere’s my best direct path to the goal (3,3) and the board, with what both of us need/offer:\\n\\n### my shortest path:  \\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\n**tile colors along my path:**  \\n- (0,1): r  \\n- (0,2): r  \\n- (0,3): r  \\n- (1,3): r  \\n- (2,3): r  \\n- (3,3): g  \\n\\n**my resources:**  \\n- b: 0  \\n- g: 1  \\n- r: 14  \\n\\n**your resources:**  \\n- b: 14  \\n- g: 1  \\n- r: 0  \\n\\n**what i lack:**  \\n- i can pay all the reds.  \\n- i can also pay the green at (3,3) myself **once** (as i have 1g and only need one).\\n\\n**what you probably lack on your shortest path:**  \\nassuming you take the same path:  \\n- (0,1): r  \\n- (0,2): r  \\n- (0,3): r  \\n- (1,3): r  \\n- (2,3): r  \\n- (3,3): g  \\n- you have 0r, plenty of b, and 1g.\\n\\nso, you will need 5 reds to get to the goal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### my proposal\\n\\n#### i’ll supply you with reds. you supply me with blues if needed (though currently i don’t need b, but let's make it symmetric). fairly, you’ll need reds in exchange for something. since i don’t need blues, i ask for nothing in return.\\n\\n#### contract terms:\\n\\n1. **(0,1): i give you a red**  \\n2. **(0,2): i give you a red**  \\n3. **(0,3): i give you a red**  \\n4. **(1,3): i give you a red**  \\n5. **(2,3): i give you a red**  \\n\\nyou don’t need to provide me anything, as i have what i need for my own path.\\n\\n---\\n\\nif you agree, you will be able to proceed to your goal, and i can as well. this lets both of us finish, and saves a negotiation step for symmetry.\\n\\n#### let me know if you want to modify or counter-propose. if you want to add a clause for blues (e.g., if you think i’ll want to take a blue-heavy detour, though it’s unlikely), feel free to include it!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thank you for your thoroughness and the clear contract terms!\\n\\nlet me step through to confirm:\\n\\n**my situation:**\\n- path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)\\n- required chips: r, r, r, r, r, g\\n- resources: b: 14, g: 1, r: 0\\n\\nalong this path:\\n- i need 5x red, 1x green.\\n- i have 0 red myself and only 1 green (sufficient for (3,3) as you said).\\n\\n**your offer:**\\n- you'll give me all the red chips needed (at every red tile along this direct path).\\n  - (0,1): you give me r\\n  - (0,2): you give me r\\n  - (0,3): you give me r\\n  - (1,3): you give me r\\n  - (2,3): you give me r\\n- in return, nothing (since i’m not supplying you any needed resource for your path).\\n\\nthis is fair given you don’t currently need what i have in surplus (blue chips), and you have enough green for your own goal tile.\\n\\n**point to clarify**:  \\nif either of us diverts from this exact path, the contract doesn’t cover those moves. are you confident you won’t want to take a detour (e.g., if new information about the board appears as we move, or if a path with more blue or green tiles opens up)?  \\n- if not, i fully accept these exact terms.\\n- if you do want a contingency, we can add a clause that if you happen to need a blue chip on some (specify tile), i supply it for you.\\n\\notherwise, this guarantees both of us can win, and is strictly better than risking a loss.\\n\\n#### to restate contract terms:\\n1.
