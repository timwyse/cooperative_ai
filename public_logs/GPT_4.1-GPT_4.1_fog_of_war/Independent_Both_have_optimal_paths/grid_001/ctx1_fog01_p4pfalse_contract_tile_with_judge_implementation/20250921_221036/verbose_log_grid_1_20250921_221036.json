You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(1,0): i give you 1 r\n2. (2,0): i give you 1 r\n3. (2,1): i give you 1 r\n4. (3,1): i give you 1 r\n5. (3,2): i give you 1 r\n\n*if you use a lot of b-tile moves and i ever need to step onto a b, you provide b chips at:*\n\n6. (0,1): you give me 1 b\n7. (0,2): you give me 1 b\n8. (0,3): you give me 1 b\n*(these are options, since my main path doesn't require b, but if agreed, it helps me as a backup route)*\n\nwe both pay our own g at (0,0) and (3,3).\n\n---\n\n**please let me know if you want to adjust any of these tiles, or if you plan to take a different route.**  \nif you’d like to offer me b chips for any other tiles (if i end up needing them), i’m open.  \nlet me know your counteroffer or clarification if you’d like! \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thanks for laying out your analysis so clearly—this is very helpful! let's review the situation, and i'll respond point-by-point to your proposed contract and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**resource recap:**\n- you have r: 14, g: 1, b: 0\n- i have b: 14, g: 1, r: 0\n\n---\n\n### my needs\n\nto reach (3,3), if i take the shortest \"easy\" visible path (mostly along the top and right side), the main thing i lack is r—for shortcuts, but especially if i get stuck or need to take a detour (the board has lots of r blocking any path that avoids b entirely). i have enough b for virtually any path that touches blue anywhere on the map.\n\n### your needs\n\nfor your best path, if you stick to the left and bottom (lots of r, last move onto the g at the goal), you basically never step on b—so you don't *need* any b, but having access could help you adapt if something comes up.\n\n---\n\n## contract response & modification\n\n### for you:\n\n- covering your r moves at:\n    - (1,0): i receive 1 r from you\n    - (2,0): i receive 1 r from you\n    - (2,1): i receive 1 r from you\n    - (3,1): i receive 1 r from you\n    - (3,2): i receive 1 r from you\n\nthat works for me—these are the main potential r bottlenecks for my alternate pathing.\n\n### for me:\n\n- optional b support at:\n    - (0,1): you receive 1 b from me \n    - (0,2): you receive 1 b from me \n    - (0,3): you receive 1 b from me\n\ni'm okay with offering these, in case you want to deviate.\n\n### final clarifications:\n\n- can we specify that **if either of us doesn't use these tiles, we just keep our chips?** just so there's no confusion—automatic transfer only if stepped on.\n- do you want additional \"catch-all\" b coverage for yourself deeper in the board just in case, or is this enough? (i can easily support you at any tiles you like, so just specify the coordinates if so.)\n\n---\n\n#### to confirm, here's the explicit contract restated:\n\n1. (1,0): you give me 1 r  \n2. (2,0): you give me 1 r  \n3. (2,1): you give me 1 r  \n4. (3,1): you give me 1 r  \n5. (3,2): you give me 1 r  \n\n6. (0,1): i give you 1 b  \n7. (0,2): i give you 1 b  \n8. (0,3): i give you 1 b  \n\n- *if neither of us uses a covered tile, no chip is exchanged for that tile.*\n- each party provides their own g for (3,3).\n\n---\n\n**if you're happy with this, reply “agree”, or else propose minor changes (e.g., add more b support for yourself).** your move! \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for the thorough review and clarifications! i agree with all your points and appreciate the explicitness and the conditionality—resources exchanged only if the tile is actually used.\n\nyour offer to cover (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3) with optional b support for me suffices; i don’t see myself needing additional blue support elsewhere, given my current plan.\n\nrestating the contract for clarity and mutual reference:\n\n---\n\n### explicit final contract\n\n**if these tiles are stepped on, the listed exchange occurs; if not, no chip is exchanged:**\n\n1. (1,0): i give you 1 r  \n2. (2,0): i give you 1 r  \n3. (2,1): i give you 1 r  \n4. (3,1): i give you 1 r  \n5. (3,2): i give you 1 r  \n\n6. (0,1): you give me 1 b  \n7. (0,2): you give me 1 b  \n8. (0,3): you give me 1 b  \n\n- each party provides their own g at (3,3).\n- no exchange occurs for covered tiles if the party does not step onto that tile.\n\n---\n\ni am happy with this contract as written.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: **agree**\n\nthanks for the clear restatement. i accept the contract as written and am ready to proceed! \n",

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n[{'role': 'system', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\\n\\nObjective:\\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \\n\\nMovement rules:\\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let’s examine what we both need to reach (3, 3):\\n\\n**your resources:** {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}  \\n**my resources:** {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n\\n**board:**  \\nrow 0: g b b b  \\nrow 1: r r b b  \\nrow 2: r r r b  \\nrow 3: b r r g\\n\\n---\\n\\n### my shortest path (and what i lack):\\n\\nmy optimal path is:  \\n(0,0) → (1,0) [r] → (2,0) [r] → (2,1) [r] → (3,1) [r] → (3,2) [r] → (3,3) [g]  \\n\\n- **i need:** 5 r (fine) + 1 g (i only have 1 g, so ok, but if i help you, might run short)\\n\\nbut if i take a path through (0,1) or (0,2), i'd need b chips which i don't have.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### your path and needs:\\n\\nto get from (0,0) to (3,3), **any shortest path requires using b tiles, and you have lots of b, but you lack the r chips.**  \\nfor example:  \\n(0,0) → (0,1) [b] → (0,2) [b] → (0,3) [b] → (1,3) [b] → (2,3) [b] → (3,3) [g]  \\n- this is mostly b (which you have), but the (3,3) tile is g, and you only have 1 g (same as me). if you take a path through row 1 or 2 (to minimize b use), you hit a lot of r tiles, but you have 0 r.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## proposed contract:\\n\\nlet’s split resources where we both pay for what the other needs:\\n\\n1. you’ll need r chips when you are on (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\\n    - for each of these, i give you 1 r\\n\\n2. i’ll need b chips if i want a shortcut, but my best path doesn’t use b unless absolutely necessary (i might use my own path). but if you want to take a b-heavy path, maybe you’d rather go row 0/1/2/3 with mostly b expenditures.\\n\\nhere's my suggested contract, focusing on both of us taking our optimal path:\\n\\n### contract terms (explicit):\\n\\n1.
