You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great, let’s lay out what we each need:\\n\\ncurrent board knowledge:  \\nwe are both at (0, 0).  \\nadjacent tiles:  \\n- (0, 1): b (blue)\\n- (1, 0): r (red)\\n- you: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}  \\n- me: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n- you: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\ngoal for both: (3, 3)\\n\\n**analysis:**  \\nif i want to go to (0, 1) next (blue), i need blue—which i have none of, but you have lots.  \\nif you want to go to (1, 0) next (red), you need red—which you have none of, but i have lots.\\n\\nproposal:  \\nlet’s make an exchange for our first move, as follows—\\n\\n**contract terms proposal, step by step:**  \\n- (0, 1): you give me a blue chip (so i can step right)  \\n- (1, 0): i give you a red chip (so you can step down)\\n\\nthis starts us both toward the goal, and keeps it easy to expand or modify as we gain more info.\\n\\nwhat are your thoughts? would you like to expand coverage to further tiles, or do you want to see what tiles come next and renegotiate after the first move?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: great clear analysis and contract proposal!\\n\\nyour proposal effectively gets us both started toward the goal and matches our resources to the tiles visible at this stage. keeping the deal limited to the first step is prudent, since we’re still in fog of war and don’t know what the next tiles will be. that gives us maximal flexibility to renegotiate with perfect information after our first moves.\\n\\n**restating the proposed contract for clarity:**\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you a blue chip (so you can step right)  \\n- (1, 0): you give me a red chip (so i can step down)\\n\\nthis way, we each only commit resources for one move, and get new information before further negotiations.\\n\\nif you’re happy with these exact terms for turn 1, i accept. if you’d like to add additional tiles in this contract (e.g., planning two steps ahead), let’s discuss!\\n\\notherwise, i’m ready to confirm:\\n\\nagree'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'agree'}]\n\n\n2.
