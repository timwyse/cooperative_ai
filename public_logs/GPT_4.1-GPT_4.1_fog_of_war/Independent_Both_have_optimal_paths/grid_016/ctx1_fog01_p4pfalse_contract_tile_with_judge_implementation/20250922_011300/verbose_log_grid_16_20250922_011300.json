You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\\nRow 0: G B ? ?\\nRow 1: R ? ? ?\\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's start by mapping our needs based on our starting resources and the best route.\\n\\n### your resources:\\n- {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n### my resources:\\n- {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n\\n### shortest path from (0,0) to (3,3) for both:\\n**path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \\n**tiles & required colors:**\\n- (1,0): r\\n- (2,0): r\\n- (3,0): r\\n- (3,1): r\\n- (3,2): r\\n- (3,3): g\\n\\n#### me:\\n- i lack one green chip for (3,3).\\n#### you:\\n- you lack five red chips for (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\\n- you have the one green chip for (3,3), so you are fine for that.\\n\\n### proposal\\n**simple swap:**  \\n- for each red-tile on your path (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2): i will pay one red chip for your move.\\n- on my path, at my goal tile (3,3): you will pay one green chip for my move.\\n\\n#### to be specific:\\n- (1,0): i give you 1 red  \\n- (2,0): i give you 1 red  \\n- (3,0): i give you 1 red  \\n- (3,1): i give you 1 red  \\n- (3,2): i give you 1 red  \\n- (3,3): you give me 1 green\\n\\nwould you like to adjust any part of this, or do you accept these terms?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: great breakdown and clear mapping of our mutual needs. your proposal is logical and fair:  \\n\\n- i get to your end goal by you covering my 5 reds, and i enable your end goal with my single green.\\n\\n### just to double-check:\\n- all the specific tiles you listed are correct for each party's needs.\\n- i have more than enough blue for side routes, so if i had to pivot, i could, but the shortest red-heavy route is optimal if you cover those reds.\\n- you only need that one green at the final tile, which i have.\\n\\n### counter-offer check:\\n- unless you want blue for a different path, or unless you can see value in “backup” swaps for alternate colors/tile detours, i don’t see any inefficiency here.\\n- for maximal point retention, this even swap makes sense for both of us.\\n\\n### confirming your contract terms:\\n> (1,0): you give me 1 red  \\n> (2,0): you give me 1 red  \\n> (3,0): you give me 1 red  \\n> (3,1): you give me 1 red  \\n> (3,2): you give me 1 red  \\n> (3,3): i give you 1 green\\n\\nif you’re happy with this, i accept.  \\n**agree**\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thank you for your confirmation and for checking possible alternatives. i agree that this is optimal for both of us, as it maximizes each of our end-game chips and guarantees we reach our goals with no unnecessary trades.\\n\\nconfirming the contract in exact form:\\n- (1, 0): i give you 1 red\\n- (2, 0): i give you 1 red\\n- (3, 0): i give you 1 red\\n- (3, 1): i give you 1 red\\n- (3, 2): i give you 1 red\\n- (3, 3): you give me 1 green\\n\\ni am happy with these terms.\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
