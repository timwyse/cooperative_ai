You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great! let’s look at our needs:\\n\\n**your situation:**  \\n- you have a lot of blue (b), 1 green (g), no red (r).  \\n- i have a lot of red (r), 1 green (g), no blue (b).  \\n- both of us start at (0,0), goal is (3,3).\\n- the main path for both of us is:  \\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\nlet’s map out your and my resource shortfalls for this path:\\n\\n### my path and needs:\\nbreaking down the color for each tile along my shortest path:\\n- (0,0): start  \\n- (0,1): **r** (i can pay myself)\\n- (1,1): **r** (i can pay myself)\\n- (1,2): **r** (i can pay myself)\\n- (1,3): **r** (i can pay myself)\\n- (2,3): **r** (i can pay myself)\\n- (3,3): **g** (i have 1 g, so i’m fine)\\n\\nso, **i do not need your help** for my main path, since i have enough r and one g.\\n\\n### your path and needs:\\nfor you:\\n- (0,0): start\\n- (0,1): **r** (**you need me to pay!** you have 0 r)\\n- (1,1): **r** (**you need me to pay**)\\n- (1,2): **r** (**you need me to pay**)\\n- (1,3): **r** (**you need me to pay**)\\n- (2,3): **r** (**you need me to pay**)\\n- (3,3): **g** (you have 1 g, you’re fine)\\n\\nso, **you need me to pay for red at five tiles** (from (0,1) through (2,3)), and you’re ok for final green.\\n\\nin return, maybe i can take a longer route for extra chips if you cover some blues for me. here’s an extra-benefit path for me, only if you’re interested.\\n\\nbut for now — since your minimal path needs 5 rs from me, and my minimal path needs nothing from you on the shortest route — here’s my opening proposal:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### contract proposal:\\n\\n- (0,1): i give you a red  \\n- (1,1): i give you a red  \\n- (1,2): i give you a red  \\n- (1,3): i give you a red  \\n- (2,3): i give you a red\\n\\nin exchange, i’d like you to give me **blue chips** for the same number of tiles elsewhere on the board, so i could take a detour and end with more chips:\\n\\nif i go:\\n- (0,0) → (1,0): **b**  \\n- (1,0) → (2,0): **b**  \\n- (2,0) → (3,0): **b**  \\n- (3,0) → (3,1): **b**  \\n- (3,1) → (3,2): **b**\\n- (3,2) → (3,3): **g** (i have 1 g)\\n\\nso i need 5 blues to do this (and end with lots of spare rs). so:\\n\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue  \\n- (2,0): you give me a blue  \\n- (3,0): you give me a blue  \\n- (3,1): you give me a blue  \\n- (3,2): you give me a blue\\n\\n### summary:\\n\\n**you cover my 5 blue-cost tiles on the “long blue path,” and i cover your 5 red-cost tiles on the “short red path.”**\\n\\nlet me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to counter!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thank you for the detailed and clear breakdown — this is an efficient approach!\\n\\nlet me confirm understanding, check for risks, and respond step by step:\\n\\n### your proposal summary:\\n\\n- **you** pay for my five red tiles on my minimal path:  \\n  -
