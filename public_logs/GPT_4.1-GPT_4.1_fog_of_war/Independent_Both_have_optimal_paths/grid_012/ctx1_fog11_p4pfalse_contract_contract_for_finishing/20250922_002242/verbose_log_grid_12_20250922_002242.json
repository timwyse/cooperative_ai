For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
