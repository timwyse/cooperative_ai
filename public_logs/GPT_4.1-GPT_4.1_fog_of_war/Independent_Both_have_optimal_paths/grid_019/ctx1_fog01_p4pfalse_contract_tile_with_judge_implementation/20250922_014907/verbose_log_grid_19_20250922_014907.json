You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

if you prefer a different path, let me know which tiles you'll need red on, and i will adjust the proposal! \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for laying this out so clearly and walking through the possible routes and resource needs step by step. i agree with your summary of the board state and our resource constraints. let me double-check your contract offer with careful attention to the tiles and colors exchanged.\n\n**summary of proposal:**\n- you cover all red tiles i may need if i take the left/vertical path.  \n- i cover all blue tiles you may need if you take the top/horizontal path.  \n- both parties are fully covered on their main short path.\n\nlet me check if either of us might want an alternate path and whether this offer is fully sufficient and fair.\n\n**your summary for my needs (assuming i go right, then down):**\n- (0,1): blue (i have myself)  \n- (0,2): blue  \n- (1,2): blue  \n- (1,3): blue  \n- (2,3): blue  \n- (3,3): green\n\ni have 14 blue, so i can pay for all blue tiles myself. i only need green on the last tile, and i already have 1.\n\n**your needs (if you go down and right):**\n- (1,0): red  \n- (2,0): red  \n- (2,1): red  \n- (3,1): red  \n- (3,2): red  \n- (3,3): green\n\nyou have 14 red and 1 green, so you already can pay for all those.\n\nthe backup/support contract only matters if one of us wants to deviate from our main color path or gets stuck. as it stands, neither of us technically requires a trade under our initial plan.\n\n**updated proposal (for maximum flexibility and safety):**\nlet's formalize a contract covering any **single tile** where either of us finds ourselves, where we need the other's help due to an unforeseen detour, but not obligate each of us to supply chips on all the main path tiles (which we already have ourselves). this way we do not \"waste\" chips unproductively and keep maximum resources.\n\n**proposal:**  \n- (any tile): if i land on a red, you will give me a red by request, up to 3 times.  \n- (any tile): if you land on a blue, i will give you a blue by request, up to 3 times.  \n\nif you'd like to limit it to a specific set of coordinates, we could restrict it to:\n- (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2): i give you a red upon request.\n- (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3): you give me a blue upon request.\n\nbut to save time, i propose **we keep things simple, and only commit to supply the missing color up to 3 times for the other if needed, only if we land on the tile, not by default.**\n\nif you'd rather stay with your specific tile-by-tile contract (which is also valid), i'm happy to agree!\n\nplease let me know if you prefer:\n1. specific-tile, always-trade contract as outlined by you,  \n2. \"on-demand,\" up-to-3-trades, based on actual paths taken,\n3. or a hybrid (e.g., only for certain coordinates).\n\nonce you choose, i can confirm: agree. \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for your careful review and thoughtful proposal!\n\ngiven that neither of us needs a trade on our optimal path, i agree that the “on-demand, up to 3 trades” model maximizes our chip retention and keeps us both safe for contingencies without unnecessary spending. i believe option 2—**on-demand coverage, up to 3 trades each, for the needed color, if called upon**—is both efficient and fair.\n\nhere’s a formal version for the contract:\n\n- (any tile): if you need red to enter and request it, i will give you 1 red chip (maximum 3 times).\n- (any tile): if i need blue to enter and request it, you will give me 1 blue chip (maximum 3 times).\n\nthis preserves our resources on the assumed optimal path, while protecting both of us if something unexpected happens or if either of us wants to try an alternate route.\n\nif this matches your understanding and you confirm, i’m ready:\n\n**agree** \n",
