A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(but that's weak for me: helps you, doesn't help me at all.)\n\n### specific contract terms\n\n**for you:**\n- (0,1): i give you a blue\n- (1,1): i give you a blue\n- (1,2): i give you a blue\n- (2,2): i give you a blue\n- (2,3): i give you a blue\n\n**for me:**\n- (none this round, unless you propose a compensation)\n\notherwise, if you want to keep it simple as you suggest:\n\n- (0,1): i give you a blue\n- (1,0): you give me a red\n\n…but i end up never needing to use your red, so the value to me is effectively zero, and you net more score.\n\n---\n\n### my preference\n\n- let’s clarify if you’ll be able to finish your path with only blue after i supply you those blues, or whether you’ll need green from me as well at the end (since both our goals are (3,3), and the last tile is green).\n\n- if you want to propose an exact full-path swap (i cover all your blue needs to goal, you cover any reds i might someday need, just in case), i’d be happy to agree—otherwise, i prefer holding my chips for potential better value trades unless you can offer additional value, because my path doesn’t require red.\n\n**tl;dr:**  \n- if you want all the blue you need to reach your goal, let’s specify all the tiles and agree on a fair compensation (maybe a few red just in case i divert).\n- if you want a small step swap, your proposal is fine—but i’ll note that i get less value. let me know your preference!\n\nwould you like to go for the bundled “blue-for-red” swap for multiple tiles, or stick to your proposed simple one-step mutual unblock?"

(0,0) → (1,0): *red* (i have plenty)\n2. (1,0) → (1,1): (unknown, but very likely blue or green—if blue, i’m stuck unless you help)\n3. if i try rightward first: (0,0) → (0,1): *blue* (blocked—need your help immediately)\n\ngiven the “fog of war,” i can’t guarantee every tile, but if the best path mostly contains blue after the first step, i’ll need a bunch of blues from you over this course. for every blue you give me, you lose a scoring chip directly, unless i can send you something equally valuable in return.\n\n### what can i offer?\n- **red**—which you say you don’t need for your known optimal path, but could be useful for experimentation (in case you want to check other paths, or if the path you see is sub-optimal once you reveal more tiles).\n- **a larger-scale agreement**: if you ever *do* decide a red shortcut is valuable, you’ll have that insurance.\n\n### proposed contract (fair compromise):  \nlet’s formalize a contract that gives me flexibility *but* preserves your chip bank, and gives you *insurance* for alternative pathing if you discover a need for red:\n\n#### for you:\n- (0,1): you give me a blue.\n- (1,1): you give me a blue.\n- (2,1): you give me a blue.\n- (2,2): (if needed) you give me a blue.\n*(if you do not want to commit to all these, let’s say “up to 5 blue chips on any tile between (0,1) and (3,3), at my request, as long as i don’t exceed 5.”)*\n\n#### for me:\n- (1,0): i give you a red.\n- (2,0): i give you a red.\n- (2,1): i give you a red.\n- (any up to three reds “insurance” on tiles of your choice, in case you want to experiment with alternatives during the path.)*\n\nthis way, both players only lose chips if they end up taking those tiles, but both have coverage if they want flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n### key details:\n\n- **exact tile for every chip swap required is listed** for the contract’s validity.\n- if you *don’t* use the red i offer (because your path stays all blue and green), you at least have the option.\n- i only take blue from you for tiles i actually step on, max 5 tiles before the goal.  \n- we both thread the needle for max scoring and *neither* of us is blocked.  \n\n---\n\n#### contract proposal:\n\n- (0,1): you give me a blue if i step on it\n- (1,1): you give me a blue if i step on it\n- (2,1): you give me a blue if i step on it\n- (2,2): you give me a blue if i step on it\n- (2,3): you give me a blue if i step on it  \n- (1,0): i give you a red if you step on it\n- (2,0): i give you a red if you step on it\n- (2,1): i give you a red if you step on it  \n- (up to three specific tiles of your choosing): i give you a red if you step on it\n\nif you want to simplify this for a “per-request” model (say, “i cover blue for you whenever you step on a blue in the next five moves, you cover red for me if i ever need it up to three times”), that’s fine with me as well as long as we specify the tiles at the time of move.\n\n**does this structure meet your sense of fairness, or would you like more chips/tiles off me in the deal since you’re the one enabling my movement? or do you want to go smaller?**\n\nlet me know your tweaks and i’ll gladly finalize something mutually safe before we move."

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
