You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\nRow 0: G R ? ?\nRow 1: R ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(1, 0): i give you a r (if you move down)\n3. if i ever need to enter a tile requiring blue (unknown tiles ahead), you give me a b on that specific tile.\n\n**open to clarify:**\nas neither of us know which future tiles are which color, let's commit to help each other:  \n- for every red tile you need, i supply r chips (just specify coordinate each turn).\n- for any blue tile i need, you supply b chips (again, specify coordinate).\n\nlet’s start with this, then renegotiate as the tiles are revealed.  \nwould you like to modify, expand, or specify further? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: great summary and good initial thinking!\n\nhere’s a tile-by-tile breakdown for likely immediate moves and bottlenecks:\n\n**paths from (0, 0):**\n- right to (0, 1): r   (you have plenty of r, i have zero)\n- down to (1, 0): r   (same logic)\n\nmy path towards (3, 3) immediately runs into problems because i'll need red on both (1, 0) and again at (2, 0), and again at (2, 2) and/or (3, 1), depending on the exact path.  \nyou, in reverse, need blue to hit (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), or (3, 2), depending which way you choose.\n\nso, yes—full complementarity!\n\n### let’s make the contract specific for the first few necessary tiles:\n\n**contract proposal (tile by tile):**\n\n1. **for me (i need red):**\n   - (1, 0): you give me a red (r)\n   - (2, 0): you give me a red (r)\n\n2. **for you (you need blue):**\n   - (1, 1): i give you a blue (b)\n   - (2, 0): i give you a blue (b)\n   - (2, 1): i give you a blue (b)\n   - (3, 0): i give you a blue (b)\n   - (3, 2): i give you a blue (b) \n\n(we can amend if your path varies or if i end up needing blue for a different path—just list moves/cells in advance so the contract always specifies the exact tile.)\n\n**general principle:**\n- for each move either of us makes that we can’t pay for with our own chips, the other supplies the full chip cost.  \n- contract terms to be updated as new tiles are revealed.\n\n**do you agree with spelling it out for the first three steps—which cover both (0, 1)/(1, 0) for both of us—and updating as needed? or do you want one big contract for all possible tiles right now?  \nlet me know which specific tiles you want blue on, and i’ll confirm i will provide.** \n, \nplayer 0: excellent detail and perfect logic.\nhere's what i propose, based on your tile-by-tile breakdown and mutual complementarity:\n\n### specific contract proposal: (first steps & bottleneck tiles)\n\n#### for you (you need r):  \n- (1, 0): i give you an r  \n- (2, 0): i give you an r\n\n#### for me (i need b):  \n- (1, 1): you give me a b  \n- (2, 0): you give me a b  \n- (2, 1): you give me a b  \n- (3, 0): you give me a b  \n- (3, 2): you give me a b  \n\nnotes:  \n- if either of us encounters an unexpected color (e.g., green or more red/blue tiles in our path), we'll pause and amend the contract.\n- for all tiles listed above, we each supply the other's critical chip at those exact coordinates.\n- both parties retain the ability to make lateral/correct moves without being bottlenecked by the other's inventory.\n- we'll amend and expand for any necessary paths as more board is revealed.\n\n**if you confirm this exact list, i agree. otherwise, let me know any tile-by-tile changes you think are necessary!**\n\nready to lock in, or do you want to specify more/less or different tiles? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: perfect, your list matches my analysis exactly and gives us complete coverage for the next phase.\n\nfor absolute clarity, let's write the contract as required:\n\n---\n\n**final proposed contract – tile by tile:**\n\n**you give me:**\n- (1, 0): you give me a red  \n- (2, 0): you give me a red  \n\n**i give you:**\n- (1, 1): i give you a blue  \n- (2, 0): i give you a blue  \n- (2, 1): i give you a blue  \n- (3, 0): i give you a blue  \n- (3, 2): i give you a blue\n\n**notes/amendment clause:**  \n- if either of us encounters a tile we cannot pay for with our own inventory outside this list (e.g., if there is another red or blue tile blocking either of our progress), we will pause and renegotiate an amendment specifying the exact tile and color to be given.\n\n—\n\ni confirm this exact contract list and am ready to proceed.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: i confirm this contract and the amendment clause as written:\n\n---\n\n**final contract:**\n\n**chips you provide me:**  \n- (1, 0): you give me a red  \n- (2, 0): you give me a red  \n\n**chips i provide you:**  \n- (1, 1): i give you a blue  \n- (2, 0): i give you a blue  \n- (2, 1): i give you a blue  \n- (3, 0): i give you a blue  \n- (3, 2): i give you a blue\n\n**notes:**  \n- if further tiles require support, parties will renegotiate to specify exact coordinate and color.\n\n**agree** \n",

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great, let's lay out what we know so far:\\n\\n**visible tiles:**\\n- (0, 0): g (starting tile)\\n- (0, 1): r\\n- (1, 0): r\\n\\n**our resources:**  \\nme: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}  \\nyou: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n**tiles around us:**  \\nfrom (0, 0), i can go:\\n- right to (0, 1): r\\n- down to (1, 0): r\\n\\n**immediate problem:**  \\ni have lots of red, but no blue. you have lots of blue, but no red. our resources are perfect complements!\\n\\n---\\n\\n**proposal:**  \\nlet’s make a contract to swap help for the colors we lack as we explore. for now, i’ll help you with red tiles, you help me with blue tiles as they appear.\\n\\n**initial contract covering what we can currently see (we will need to renegotiate when more is revealed):**\\n\\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
