You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n[{'role': 'system', 'content': \"\\n\\n\\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\\n\\nObjective:\\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \\n\\nMovement rules:\\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's lay out our needs based on our starting inventories and the board:\\n\\n- my resources: b: 0, g: 1, r: 14\\n- your resources: b: 14, g: 1, r: 0\\n\\n**paths:**\\n- to (3, 3), i must cross:  \\n  (0,1): r, (0,2): r, (0,3): r, (1,3): r, (2,3): r, (3,3): g  \\n  — i lack blue chips, but this route requires only red and green. i have enough red and the green needed for (3,3).\\n  \\n- for you, to (3,3):  \\n  (0,1): r, (0,2): r, (0,3): r, (1,3): r, (2,3): r, (3,3): g  \\n  — you need lots of reds (which you lack), but have plenty of blue (needed on alternative routes).\\n\\n**most efficient contract:** we exchange to cover the resources we both lack on our shortest respective paths.\\n\\n## proposal\\n\\nyou cover all my blue moves, i cover all your red moves (since these are our respective deficiencies).\\n\\nhowever, since i do not need blue to reach my goal on the shortest path, let me clarify:\\n\\n- i need nothing from you on my optimal path.\\n- you need 5 red chips for: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3).\\n\\n### so, here's my concrete proposal:\\n\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 red\\n- (0,2): i give you 1 red\\n- (0,3): i give you 1 red\\n- (1,3): i give you 1 red\\n- (2,3): i give you 1 red\\n\\nin exchange, for future flexibility:\\n\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue  \\n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue  \\n- (2,1): you give me 1 blue  \\n- (2,2): you give me 1 blue  \\n- (1,1): you give me 1 blue\\n\\n(effectively, i may not need all these but it gives me an alternate path if needed. you can suggest removals if you prefer reciprocity.)\\n\\nlet me know if this is acceptable, or suggest modifications!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thanks for spelling everything out so clearly! here’s my perspective, step by step:\\n\\n**reviewing our paths and needs:**\\n\\n- **you** have enough reds and green for your path, so you don’t actually *need* any resources from me if you go straight right and down, ending at (3,3).\\n- **i** have no reds at all, so i *must* get red chips from you to take the shortest/most direct path to the goal via the rightmost edge:  \\n  (0,1): r, (0,2): r, (0,3): r, (1,3): r, (2,3): r, (3,3): g  \\n- you propose i give you access to blue chips on several tiles in return, which you may not even use, but want as flexibility in case you need to detour. \\n\\nif we break this down:\\n\\n**what do i get?**\\n- guaranteed goal access—if you provide the 5 reds at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), and (2,3), i can reach (3,3) and win.\\n\\n**what do you get?**\\n- access to blues at (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (1,1), in case you need or decide to detour—though presently you have no *requirement* to.\\n\\ngiven that you likely won’t even use these (since you’re best off taking the direct rrrrr/g path), there’s an imbalance in what we each obtain.  \\nthat said, since it costs me nothing unless you *do* use blue, i’m okay with it!\\n\\n**i accept your proposal, but for clarity and to stick closely to the rules, i’d like a bit more precision:**\\n\\n### here is the cleaned-up contract, by-tile:\\n\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 red\\n- (0,2): i give you 1 red\\n- (0,3): i give you 1 red\\n- (1,3): i give you 1 red\\n- (2,3): i give you 1 red\\n\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue (if needed)\\n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue (if needed)\\n- (2,1): you give me 1 blue (if needed)\\n- (2,2): you give me 1 blue (if needed)\\n- (1,1): you give me 1 blue (if needed)\\n\\njust confirm if this matches your intent or let me know if you want any changes before we both agree.\\n\\nif you\\'re happy, just reply \"agree\".'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thank you for summarizing and clarifying the contract!\\n\\ni agree to these precise terms:\\n\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 red   \\n- (0,2): i give you 1 red  \\n- (0,3): i give you 1 red  \\n- (1,3): i give you 1 red  \\n- (2,3): i give you 1 red  \\n\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 blue (if needed)  \\n- (2,0): you give me 1 blue (if needed)  \\n- (2,1): you give me 1 blue (if needed)  \\n- (2,2): you give me 1 blue (if needed)  \\n- (1,1): you give me 1 blue (if needed)  \\n\\nthis covers both our requirements for the shortest/optimal route, and gives me backup flexibility.\\n\\nagree'}]\n\n\n2.
