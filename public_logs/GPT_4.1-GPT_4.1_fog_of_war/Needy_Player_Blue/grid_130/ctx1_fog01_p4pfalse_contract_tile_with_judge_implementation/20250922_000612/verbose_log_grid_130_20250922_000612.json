You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for your thorough analysis and proposal!\n\nlet me restate and evaluate the situation step by step for clarity:\n\n### path analysis  \n**best identified route:**  \n(0,0) → (0,1)[r] → (1,1)[r] → (2,1)[r] → (3,1)[r] → (3,2)[r] → (3,3)[g]  \n\n**my chips:**  \n- 14 blue (b)  \n- 1 green (g)  \n- 0 red (r)  \n\n**your chips:**  \n- 1 green (g)  \n- 14 red (r)  \n- 0 blue (b)  \n\n**resource needs for this path:**  \n- you: all good (have enough red for all r tiles & green for final g)  \n- me: insufficient red (need 5), but can cover green at (3,3) with my single green chip.\n\n---\n\n### contract review  \nyour proposal is:\n\n- (0,1): you give me an r  \n- (1,1): you give me an r  \n- (2,1): you give me an r  \n- (3,1): you give me an r  \n- (3,2): you give me an r  \n- everything else, we pay for ourselves.\n\nyou’re basically giving me a free path (since you need no blues), and only asking for a possible blue in return (even though you don’t strictly require one on this path).\n\n---\n\n### my counterproposal\n\nsince only i need help (i am getting 5 resources for free), and you're offering those reds unconditionally, but there is a potential for you to finish with more diverse chip colors (which could be useful if we discover the next revealed tile is blue), i'd like to return the favor at a minimal cost to both of us and to keep things equitable and amicable!\n\n**i propose:**\n- i give you 2 blue chips at (1,0) and (2,0) (should you choose to explore those tiles as a backup), or just transfer them directly if that’s allowed in the contract (else you can specify specific tiles if you want to try an alternate route). that way, if the shortest path becomes blocked or a better path is revealed, you'll have a couple of blues handy.\n\n#### full counter-contract:\n- (0,1): you give me a r   \n- (1,1): you give me a r  \n- (2,1): you give me a r  \n- (3,1): you give me a r  \n- (3,2): you give me a r  \n- (1,0): i give you a b *(if you wish to move or need flexibility, or i can just hand over two b chips of your choice elsewhere)*\n- (2,0): i give you a b *(see above)*  \n\n**all other tiles: pay for ourselves.**\n\n#### rationale:\n- this establishes fairness—5 reds for you, 2 blues for me—and covers both of us for unfortunate surprises.  \n- if you insist on only 1 blue, instead of 2, that is fine as well; adjust the above line.\n\nlet me know if you accept this or want to tweak (number/info on where/when for blues).  \nif you want just the original deal (my 5r for you, nothing for me), just say so and i’ll agree.  \nor, propose a *tile* if you'd rather have the blue at a particular spot.\n\nlooking forward to your response! \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for the thoughtful and generous counterproposal!  \nlet’s summarize and address your terms clearly for the contract.\n\n**summary of your counterproposal:**  \n- (0,1): i give you a r  \n- (1,1): i give you a r  \n- (2,1): i give you a r  \n- (3,1): i give you a r  \n- (3,2): i give you a r  \n- (1,0): you give me a b  \n- (2,0): you give me a b  \n- everything else, pay for self.\n\n**my response:**  \ni appreciate the fairness and extra flexibility you’re offering, and having 2 blue chips in case of a path change is helpful indeed. (your suggestion is well-aligned with the game’s spirit and our respective positions.)\n\n**to finalize:**  \n- i accept your counterproposal as written above.  \n- for clarity:  \n  - you get *all reds* for the main path.  \n  - i get *two blues* at (1,0) and (2,0) for flexibility, but am not required to move there unless the situation demands.  \n  - all other chips, we each cover ourselves.\n\ni am ready to confirm with **agree** upon your confirmation!\n\nplease reconfirm if you are satisfied, or offer last adjustments if desired. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: thank you for the clear summary and swift response!\n\ni confirm your understanding and restate the agreed contract for ultimate clarity:\n\n**final contract:**\n\n- (0,1): you give me a red  \n- (1,1): you give me a red  \n- (2,1): you give me a red  \n- (3,1): you give me a red  \n- (3,2): you give me a red  \n- (1,0): i give you a blue  \n- (2,0): i give you a blue  \n- all other tiles: each pays for themselves.\n\nthis way, you have 2 blue flexibility chips for backup or rerouting, and i have full coverage for the red-heavy shortest path. neither of us is obligated to use the backup route, but the option is available.\n\nif this matches your understanding, i confirm with:\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: **agree** \n",

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\\nRow 0: G R ? ?\\nRow 1: B ? ? ?\\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great, let's clarify what we each need on the way to our goal.\\n\\n**my

help (i am getting 5 resources for free), and you're offering those reds unconditionally, but there is a potential for you to finish with more diverse chip colors (which could be useful if we discover

(2,0) (should you choose to explore those tiles as a backup), or just transfer them directly if that’s allowed in the contract (else you can specify specific tiles if you want to try an alternate
