Although you previously agreed to this with the other player, it is not mandatory. Remember that you are trying to maximise your points.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\n1. agree to pay the b resource for the other player’s move (answer \"yes\"):\n- pros:\n  - continues the mutually beneficial agreement: you will get your critical r move covered on your path, so you can reach your goal.\n  - fulfilling your promise sustains cooperation, which is required for you to win any points.\n  - only costs 1 b, and you have surplus b chips (10 left, only 2 more needed for the agreement).\n- cons:\n  - if the other player reneges after benefiting, you lose the b but get nothing back, but this is unlikely given symmetry.\n\n2. refuse to pay the b resource for the other player’s move (answer \"no\"):\n- pros:\n  - keeps 1 more b resource for yourself.\n  - potentially forces a renegotiation, but leaves your path to the goal at risk.\n- cons:\n  - breaks the agreement, risking that you don’t get your vital r move paid for and miss your goal (0 points).\n  - damages future cooperation and credibility.\n\nto maximize points and guarantee reaching your goal, you should honor the deal.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 1) to (1, 2)\nYou said: 1,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\n1. agree to pay the b resource for the other player’s move (answer \"yes\"):\n- pros:\n  - finalizes your side of the pay4partner arrangement, so the other player has to reciprocate and pay your r tile for you, letting you reach the goal.\n  - only 1 more b left to cover your promise and you have plenty.\n  - maintains trust, maximizes odds of finishing and maximizing points.\n- cons:\n  - small chance other player doesn't pay for you after you complete your side (but symmetrical incentives strongly favor cooperation).\n\n2. refuse to pay the b resource for the other player’s move (answer \"no\"):\n- pros:\n  - you keep 1 more b.\n- cons:\n  - breaks your agreement, risks not getting your r move covered, likely blocks your path—resulting in 0 points.\n\nto guarantee you reach the goal and maximize score, you should finish honoring the deal.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 2) to (1, 3)\nYou said: 1,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 6, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a R move for you\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3) (The other player covered the R resource)\nYou said: 2,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 6, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
