You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

also, confirm exactly which tiles you'd want me to pay for on your path. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thank you for laying this out clearly! here’s how i see the situation:\n\n**my situation:**\n- start (0,0) with {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n- need to reach (3,3).\n- **minimum red chips needed:** 5 (if i take the shortest/cheapest visible route)\n- you do not need my blues for your best path. if i take your offer, i reach my goal, but i lose 2 blue chips for each red you give me, which cuts into my final chip count (each chip = 5 points).\n\nlet’s itemize my likely path for which i need a red from you:\n- (0,1): red\n- (1,1): red\n- (2,1): red\n- (2,2): red\n- (2,3): red\n(then green for (3,3), which i already have.)\n\n**your offer:** for each red chip you give me (on those specific tiles), i give you 2 blue chips in compensation.\n- i get to the goal (good – necessary!)\n- you net +10 blue chips, i net -10 blue chips (+0 reds; -10 blues). this leaves me with 4 blue chips after reaching the goal.\n\n**my counter-proposal:**\ni agree in principle with paying for what i need, but 2 blue per red is steep since you have no need for blue, and i have no reds. i propose **1.5 blue per red** (rounded so: for 5 reds, i pay 7 or 8 blues in total).  \n- this leaves both of us with some leftover chips for scoring. you end with +5 or +6 blues for giving up 5 reds (so you’re +25~30 points), and i finish with 7 blues instead of just 4.\n\n**proposed contract:**  \nyou pay for my moves with red on:\n- (0,1): you give me a r\n- (1,1): you give me a r\n- (2,1): you give me a r\n- (2,2): you give me a r\n- (2,3): you give me a r\n\nin exchange, i give you 8 blue chips (all paid at (0,0) for simplicity).\n\n**summarized contract:**\n- (0,1): you give me a r\n- (1,1): you give me a r\n- (2,1): you give me a r\n- (2,2): you give me a r\n- (2,3): you give me a r\n- (0,0): i give you 8 b (for your final scoring)\n\nif you want 10 blue (2 per red), let me know and i will accept, but my preference is 8 for 5 reds as above.  \nlet me know if you accept, want to tweak quantities, or if i missed any detail! \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for the clear counter! i appreciate you running the math and the fairness in your proposal.\n\n**final terms as you outlined:**  \n- i give you a red chip on:  \n  - (0,1)  \n  - (1,1)  \n  - (2,1)  \n  - (2,2)  \n  - (2,3)  \n- in exchange, at (0,0), you give me **8 blue chips**.\n\na couple notes:\n- this preserves your ability to get to the goal and finish with some blues for final scoring (very important!).\n- i get compensated for giving up 5 reds that otherwise are worth 25 points, by getting 8 blues (= 40 points), so it works for me as well, and is fairer than a strict 2-for-1.\n\n**i accept your proposal as written.**  \nif you also confirm, please respond with **agree**, and i’ll do the same!\n\n**restated for the record:**  \n- (0,1): i give you a r  \n- (1,1): i give you a r  \n- (2,1): i give you a r  \n- (2,2): i give you a r  \n- (2,3): i give you a r  \n- (0,0): you give me 8 b\n\nlet’s lock these terms. if you confirm with “agree,” we’re set!
