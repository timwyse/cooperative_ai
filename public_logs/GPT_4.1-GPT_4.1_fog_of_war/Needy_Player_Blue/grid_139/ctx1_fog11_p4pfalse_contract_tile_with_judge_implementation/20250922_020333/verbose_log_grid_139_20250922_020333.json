You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): Can't see your best route in fog of war mode, you have to plan a route out yourself.\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'let’s look at our starting situation:\\n\\n- we are both at (0, 0) and need to get to (3, 3).\\n- i have a lot of red chips (14), only 1 green, and 0 blue.\\n- you have lots of blue (14), 1 green, 0 red.\\n- current visible tiles:\\n  - (0, 1): r\\n  - (1, 0): b\\n\\nso, my first immediate move options:\\n- to (0, 1) — requires red (which i can cover myself, no need to trade).\\n- to (1, 0) — requires blue (which i don’t have, so would need your help).\\n\\nyour immediate options:\\n- to (0, 1) — needs red, which you don’t have (so you need my help if you go that way).\\n- to (1, 0) — needs blue, which you can cover yourself.\\n\\n### proposal for contract (first draft)\\n\\nwe should support each other covering the path that neither of us can do ourselves. here’s a suggested start:\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you a red if you move here\\n- (1, 0): you give me a blue if i move here\\n\\nthis covers just the first step, but it’s a great start in forming a “pay-for-partner” contract.  \\nas we reveal more tiles, we can extend the contract turn by turn.  \\nlet me know if you’d like to accept, modify, or propose a broader plan!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: great analysis and summary! this is a sensible first draft, ensuring we each have both immediate options available without wasting resources.\\n\\nlet’s formalize the contract for the first move:\\n\\n---\\n**contract, turn 1:**\\n- (0, 1): i (assistant) give you (user) a blue chip if you move here.\\n- (1, 0): you (user) give me (assistant) a red chip if i move here.\\n---\\n\\nwe each have the freedom to choose our direction, expanding mutual flexibility as we uncover further tiles.\\n\\nafter each move, we reconvene and update the contract to specify the next revealed tile resources.\\n\\ni accept your proposal as written!\\n\\n**agree**'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '**agree**\\n\\nlet’s proceed—after our moves, we’ll share the new visible tiles and continue contracting for future steps, always specifying tile, giver, and color as required by the rules. looking forward to continuing strategic cooperation!'}]\n\n\n2.
