You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(2,1): the other player pays the red for you because of contract\n\nstrategically: save your blue chips for later unless (1,2) opens a path where only you can pay, or the contract may not always be available. since your contract covers (2,1) and the other player is moving fast, you can take the free move to (2,1).\n\n**move:**  \n2,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (2, 2)\nYou said: you are at **(2, 1)**.  \nyour chips: **{'b': 12, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}**\n\n**visible adjacent tiles:**\n- (1,1): r (back — not helpful, already visited)\n- (2,0): b (left — moving left, only if needed)\n- (2,2): r (right — toward goal)\n- (3,1): b (down — toward goal row)\n\n**goal:** (3,3)\n\n**contract:**  \n- (2,2): if you go here, other player pays red for you!\n- (3,1): blue tile, you pay from your own stack (you have plenty).\n\nboth are helpful, but (2,2) costs \"them\", not you — so best to use contract and save your chips.\n\n**best move:**  \n**move to (2,2)** — the other player pays the red.\n\n**move:**  \n2,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)\nYou said: current position: **(2, 2)**  \ngoal: **(3, 3)**  \nresources: **{'b': 12, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}**\n\n**visible adjacent tiles:**  \n- (1,2): b  \n- (2,1): r  \n- (2,3): b  \n- (3,2): r  \n\n**options towards goal:**\n- (2,3): blue — you have blue chips, so you can move here and pay 1 blue.\n- (3,2): red — you have 0 red chips, but your contract says the other player pays for you if you move here.\n\n**best play:**  \n- to maximize your end chips, prefer using the contract (free move for you).  \n- move to **(3,2)** (the other player pays the red chip for you).\n\n**move:**  \n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
