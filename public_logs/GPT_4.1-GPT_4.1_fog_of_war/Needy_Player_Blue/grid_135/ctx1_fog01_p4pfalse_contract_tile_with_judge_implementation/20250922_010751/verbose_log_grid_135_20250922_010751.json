You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'let’s look closely at our needs:\\n\\n**my path and resources:**\\n- i have 14r, 1g, 0b.\\n- my ideal path to (3, 3) is:  \\n(0,0) [g] → (1,0) [r] → (1,1) [r] → (1,2) [r] → (2,2) [r] → (3,2) [r] → (3,3) [g]  \\nso i need: 1g (start), 5r.  \\n**but** on (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) – all r, which i have enough of.  \\n**problem tiles for me:** (0,0) [g] (i have enough), (3,3) [g] (i do **not** have a second green for final tile!)\\n\\n**your resources:** 14b, 1g, 0r.  \\nlooking at your path, you are lacking r for almost all intermediate steps, but will have b for most blue tiles.  \\n**you will need my r for almost every step except where the tile is b or g.**\\n\\n## initial proposal\\n\\nlet’s help each other pay where we lack, step by step.\\n\\n### tiles where i need help:\\n- (3, 3): you give me 1g\\n\\n### tiles where you need help:\\nassuming you take this path:  \\n(0,0) [g] → (0,1) [b] → (1,1) [r] → (1,2) [r] → (2,2) [r] → (3,2) [r] → (3,3) [g]  \\n\\nyou need my r at:\\n- (1,1): i give you 1r\\n- (1,2): i give you 1r\\n- (2,2): i give you 1r\\n- (3,2): i give you 1r\\n\\ncould you handle (0,0) [g] and (3,3) [g] yourself, using your only g chip?\\n\\nso the contract, tile by tile:\\n\\n**you give me:**\\n- (3,3): you give me 1g\\n\\n**i give you:**\\n- (1,1): i give you 1r\\n- (1,2): i give you 1r\\n- (2,2): i give you 1r\\n- (3,2): i give you 1r\\n\\nif you want more favorable terms for yourself, please counter! this is my opening proposal.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: this is a clear and well-specified proposal! let me step through the terms, make sure both my survival and chip count are maximized, and see if i want to counter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### my walkthrough:\\n\\nhere's my inventory:  \\n- 14b, 1g, 0r\\n\\n**my likely best path:**  \\n(0,0) [g] → (0,1) [b] → (1,1) [r] → (1,2) [r] → (2,2) [r] → (3,2) [r] → (3,3) [g]\\n\\n**tiles and requirements:**\\n- (0,0): [g] — must pay to enter from outside, but i start here so no cost this turn.\\n- (0,1): [b] — i have b, fine.\\n- (1,1): [r] — i need help (no r).\\n- (1,2): [r] — i need help (no r).\\n- (2,2): [r] — i need help (no r).\\n- (3,2): [r] — i need help (no r).\\n- (3,3): [g] — i have 1g, can use for this final step, but then can’t help you with green.\\n\\n#### key issue:\\nif i spend my only green on my own (3,3) move, i can’t give you a green for your (3,3) move.  \\nif i give you my only green, i can’t enter (3,3) myself and will lose everything.\\n\\n**both of us can’t finish if only one green exists.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### counter proposal\\n\\nunless: there is another green tile on our path before (3,3) or you have more than 1 green?
