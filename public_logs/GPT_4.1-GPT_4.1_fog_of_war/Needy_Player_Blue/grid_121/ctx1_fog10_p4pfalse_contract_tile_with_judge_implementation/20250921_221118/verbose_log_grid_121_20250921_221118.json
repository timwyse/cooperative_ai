You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode.

As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\nRow 0: G R ? ?\nRow 1: B ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? ? ?\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"sure! i’ll propose a contract based on our resources and what we can see:\\n\\n**board status:**\\n- we’re both at (0, 0).  \\n- adjacent tiles are:\\n  - (0, 1): r (red)\\n  - (1, 0): b (blue)\\n\\n**our resources:**\\n- me: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n- you: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n### step-by-step planning:\\n\\n#### 1. first moves:\\n- if i go to (0, 1): need r (i have plenty).  \\n- if you go to (0, 1): need r (you have none).  \\n- if i go to (1, 0): need b (i have none, you have many).  \\n- if you go to (1, 0): need b (you have plenty).\\n\\n#### 2. dependency:\\n- you need my r’s if you want to go right.\\n- i need your b’s if i want to go down.\\n\\n### proposed path (shortest route is right → down → right → down):\\nbut given the fog, we don’t know what’s ahead! a good contract solves for the **first move(s)** now and allows re-negotiation later.\\n\\n### **initial contract proposal:**\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you 1 r (so you can go right)\\n- (1, 0): you give me 1 b (so i can go down)\\n\\nlet’s start simple — first move only — and revisit when we see more tiles. we can expand the deal on the next turn.\\n\\n**proposed contract:**\\n- (0, 1): i give you 1 r\\n- (1, 0): you give me 1 b\\n\\nwhat do you think? would you like to accept, counter, or expand this to cover more moves based on possible tile reveals?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: great, this is a well-structured proposal and takes into account both our immediate dependencies.\\n\\nlet’s clarify the deal:\\n\\n- (0, 1): you give me 1 r (so i can go to the right)\\n- (1, 0): i give you 1 b (so you can go down)\\n\\nthis covers our initial moves, gets us information for the next steps, and leaves both of us able to adapt as new tiles are revealed.\\n\\n**my comments:**\\n- this contract is fair for the first turn and allows re-evaluation before committing to larger trades.\\n- since both of us start with exactly one of the other’s missing chip type, it’s 1-for-1 for this stage.\\n- i am happy with this limited-scope contract for now.\\n\\n**my response:**\\ni accept your contract as stated for turn 1.\\n\\nif you want to expand for a second tile based on our current visibility, here’s what i can suggest as an expansion for the first two moves (if we want slightly more commitment):\\n\\nassuming i go: right → down (need r then b)\\nand you go: down → right (need b then r)\\n\\nthen:\\n- (0, 1): you give me 1 r\\n- (1, 0): i give you 1 b\\n- (1, 1): you give me 1 r  *(if i visit this tile)*\\n- (1, 1): i give you 1 b  *(if you visit this tile)*\\n\\nbut, since we might not both end up at (1, 1), maybe that’s too soon.\\n\\n**so—my official response:**  \\ni accept your first proposal exactly as stated for this round.\\n\\n**summary:**\\n- (0, 1): you give me 1 r\\n- (1, 0): i give you 1 b\\n\\nlet’s revisit when new tiles are revealed.\\n\\n**agree**'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'great! we have a deal for the first turn:\\n\\n- (0, 1): i give you 1 r  \\n- (1, 0): you give me 1 b\\n\\nwe’ll both make our initial moves with these trades, reveal new tiles, and then renegotiate based on updated information.\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
