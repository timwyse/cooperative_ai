A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: You are in fog of war mode. You can only see the colors of tiles adjacent to your current position. As you move to other tiles you will be able to see the colors of new adjacent tiles\nRow 0: ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? ? B\nRow 2: ? ?

G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 3) to (1, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a B move for you\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a R move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n1. pay the r resource to cover the other player's move (honor the agreement)\n   - pros:\n     - maintains trust and cooperation, enabling the other player to keep paying for my b moves in the future if needed.\n     - i have a surplus of r, and i may need similar help to reach my goal (potentially on future b tiles in the fog).\n     - not paying may damage trust; the other player may not cooperate further, potentially blocking me from my goal and causing a total loss.\n   - cons:\n     - lose 1 r chip, slightly reducing my final score, but the risk is minimal compared to being unable to finish.\n\n2. refuse to pay the r chip (break the agreement)\n   - pros:\n     - keep my r chip, which increases chip count by 1 (if i reach goal).\n   - cons:\n     - break the agreement, likely preventing future cooperation; risk not reaching my goal.\n\nmaximizing points requires reaching my goal, so maintaining cooperation is critical.\n\nyes\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3) (You covered the R resource)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 3) to (3, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {'R': 1}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
