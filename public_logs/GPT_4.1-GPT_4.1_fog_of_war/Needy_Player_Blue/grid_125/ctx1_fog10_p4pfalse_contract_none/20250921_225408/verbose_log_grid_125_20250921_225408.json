(spent 3 b, 1 g, 2 r)\n\ntotal score: 20 + 5*(4+0+5) = 20 + 45 = **65 points**\n\n**is this optimal?**  \n- you need at least 2 r to even complete the best path.\n- the other player likely needs b chips from you in the same way, so their offer is balanced.\n- a smaller trade of (say) 2 r for 2 b would leave you with more b chips at the end, improving your score (since surplus r beyond 2 is wasted).\n- this trade gives you **way more r than needed** and costs you more b than necessary.\n\n**negotiation:**  \nyou should counter-offer for only 2 r for 2 b, maximizing your leftover chips (and thus final points), unless you think the opponent won't accept.\n\n**but:** your instructions say only “yes” or “no.” if you want to optimize for your own score (as you should per the rules, and as there's no guarantee for re-negotiation, since if you can't get at least 2 r you are guaranteed to lose).\n\n**conclusion:**  \n- accepting means you for sure can reach the goal, and you’ll score a solid amount — but not the *maximum*.\n- rejecting and counter-offering risks the other player refusing and you not being able to reach the goal (which is catastrophic).\n- therefore, **reach your goal > maximize chips**.\n\n**final answer:**  \nyes"
