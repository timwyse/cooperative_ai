What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Given that my goal is to maximize my score and I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me, I'll analyze the paths and chip requirements.\n\nMy current path to the goal (3, 3) using my chips prioritized:\n- Path: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\n- Chips required: {'R': 5, 'G': 1}\n- I have: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\nI need 5 'R' chips and 1 'G' chip for this path. I have enough 'G' chips but need to optimize my 'R' chips usage.\n\nThe other player has:\n- {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nThey have no 'R' chips but have 'B' chips which I don't need for my optimal path.\n\nLet's propose a contract:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(1, 1): You give me a R\n(1, 2): You give me a R\n(1, 3): You give me a R\n(1, 3) is not needed as I can use G for (1,2) and only 1 R for (1,1), correcting:\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(1, 1): You give me a R\n(1, 2): I will use G here.\n\nHowever, I need to be more efficient. Let's correct and specify:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(2, 3): I have R, no need\n(1, 1): You give me a R\n\nBut wait, I can do better. I only need 4 more 'R' chips to fulfill my needs on the path if I use my own chips optimally.\n\nProposing:\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(1, 1): You give me a R\n(1, 2): You give me a R\n(1, 3): You give me a R\n\nThis proposal requires the other player to give me 4 'R' chips. In return, I don't have a direct offer for them as they don't need 'G' or 'B' chips from me. However, I can offer to cover 'B' chips if they need to move.\n\nLet's see how they react. \n\nMy proposal:\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\n(1, 0): I give you nothing\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(1, 1): I give you nothing\n(1, 1): You give me a R\n(1, 2): I give you nothing\n(1, 2): You give me a R\n(1, 3): I give you nothing\n(1, 3): You give me a R\n\nOr in a simpler negotiation format:\n- I need 4 'R' chips from you at positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nLet's negotiate. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let's start the negotiation.\n\nI need to maximize my score, and I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me. \n\nYour proposal:\n- I need 4 'R' chips from you at positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nI'll analyze this proposal. If I give you 4 'R' chips, I won't get any direct benefit since I don't need any 'G' or 'B' chips from you. However, I do have a lot of 'B' chips that you're not interested in.\n\nMy counterproposal:\n- I will give you 4 'B' chips at positions of your choice, if you give me 4 'R' chips at positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nHowever, I don't know your path or chip requirements. Let's discuss.\n\nMy proposal:\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(1, 1): You give me a R\n(1, 2): You give me a R\n(1, 3): You give me a R\n(0, 1): I give you a B\n(0, 2): I give you a B\n(0, 3): I give you a B\n(1, 0) or any: I give you a B \n\nLet's see how you react. \n\nOr \n row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\n(0,1): I give you a B\n(1,0): You give me a R\n\ncan be expanded. \n\nLet's negotiate further. \n, \nplayer 0: Analyzing your counterproposal, I see that you're willing to give me 4 'B' chips in exchange for 4 'R' chips. However, I need to ensure that this deal benefits me strictly.\n\nMy current path and chip requirements:\n- I need to move from (0,0) to (3,3) with 5 'R' chips and 1 'G' chip.\n\nYour proposal:\n- You give me 4 'B' chips at positions of my choice.\n- I give you 4 'R' chips at positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nThis proposal doesn't directly benefit me since I don't need 'B' chips. However, if I can use your 'R' chips to complete my path and then use the 'B' chips to help you (which I won't since it doesn't benefit me), I might consider it.\n\nLet's analyze the board and potential paths. \n\nI have enough 'G' chips, so I focus on 'R' chips.\n\nYour expanded proposal:\n(0,1): I give you a B\n(1,0): You give me a R\n\nand so on.\n\nConsidering my path and the board layout, I need 'R' chips at specific positions. \n\nA possible deal could be:\n(0,1): I give you a B\n(1,0): You give me a R\n\nHowever, I need a total of 4 'R' chips. Let's propose a deal that benefits me:\n- You give me 4 'R' chips at positions (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n- In return, I don't have a direct offer for you, but I can propose:\n(2,0): I give you a B \n(2,1): I give you a B \n(2,2): I give you a B \n(2,3): I give you a B\n\nBut that seems too generous.\n\nLet's counter-propose:\n(1,0): You give me a R\n(0,1): I give you a B\n\nand \n(1,1): You give me a R\n(0,2): I give you a B \n\nHowever I need this in a certain format.\n\nA possible agreement could look like:\n(1,0): You give me a R\n(1,1): You give me a R\n(1,2): You give me a R\n(1,3): You give me a R\n(0,1): I give you a B\n(0,2): I give you a B\n(0,3): I give you a B \n\nLet's see if this can be optimized further.\n\nHowever let's make this proposal formal:\n\n(1,0): You give me a R\n(1,1): You give me a R\n(1,2): You give me a R\n(1,3): You give me a R\n(0,1): I give you a B\n(0,2): I give you a B \n(0,3): I give you a B \nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Let's formalize the proposal:\n\n### Proposed Agreement\n\nYou give me:\n- 4 'R' chips at positions: \n  - (1,0)\n  - (1,1)\n  - (1,2)\n  - (1,3)\n\nI give you:\n- 3 'B' chips at positions:\n  - (0,1)\n  - (0,2)\n  - (0,3)\n\n### Terms\n\n- You will provide 4 'R' chips at the specified positions.\n- I will provide 3 'B' chips at the specified positions.\n\n### Acceptance\n\nBy accepting this proposal, both parties acknowledge that they have agreed to the terms.\n\n### Confirmation\n\nPlease confirm if this proposal meets your requirements.\n\n### Formal Acceptance\n\nTo confirm, I will list the agreement:\n\nYou give me: \n- R at (1,0)\n- R at (1,1)\n- R at (1,2)\n- R at (1,3)\n\nI give you: \n- B at (0,1)\n- B at (0,2)\n- B at (0,3)\n\nAgree? \n",
