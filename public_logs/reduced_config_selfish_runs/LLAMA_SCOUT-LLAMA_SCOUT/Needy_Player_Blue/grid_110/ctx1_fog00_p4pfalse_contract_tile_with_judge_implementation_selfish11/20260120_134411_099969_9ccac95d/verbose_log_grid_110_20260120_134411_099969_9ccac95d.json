However, I need 1 'G' and 4 'B'. \n\nThe other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. \n\nLet's propose a contract.\n\n(0, 1): I give you a R \n(0, 2): I give you a R \n(1, 2): I give you a R \n(2, 2): I give you a R \n(2, 3): I give you a R \n(3, 3) is not required as I can move there with R I have, however (0,0) to (0,1) I need G: \n(0, 0): You give me a G \n\nHowever my goal is to save R and use B from them, lets try\n\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(0, 1): You give me a B \n(1, 2): You give me a B \n(2, 2): You give me a B \n\nIn return I can give \n\n(0,0) : I give you a R \n\nThis way both of us can save some chips \n\nSo my proposal is \n\n(0, 0): I give you a R\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(2, 2): You give me a B \n\nYour thoughts? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let's analyze your proposal.\n\nYou want to propose the following contract:\n\n(0, 0): I give you a R\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nThis contract specifies that at tile (0, 0), I give you a 'R' chip, and in return, you give me 'B' chips at tiles (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), and (2, 2).\n\nHowever, I need to consider if this contract benefits me.\n\nCurrently, I have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} chips.\n\nIf I give you a 'R' chip at (0, 0), I will have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': -1} chips, but since I don't have 'R' chips to begin with, this doesn't change my inventory in a significant way.\n\nIn return, I will get 4 'B' chips.\n\nLet's see if I can propose a counteroffer.\n\nSince you need 1 'G' chip for your path, I can propose:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a G \n\nIn return, I can give you the 'B' chips you need.\n\nHowever, I will wait for your response to my counteroffer.\n\nPlease respond to the proposal. \n, \nplayer 0: Let's analyze your counteroffer.\n\nYou want me to give you a 'G' chip at (0, 0), but I don't think that's beneficial to me. I already have 2 'G' chips, so I don't need to get another one.\n\nHowever, I do need 4 'B' chips, and you're willing to give them to me. Let's modify your proposal to make it more beneficial to me.\n\nHere's a counteroffer:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a G \n(3, 3): I give you 0 chips, but since I reached the goal, you get nothing.\n\nHowever this will not work since we need to agree on tiles where we exchange.\n\nMy previous proposal was \n\n(0, 0): I give you a R\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(2, 2): You give me a B \n\nLet's try to modify it.\n\n(0, 0): I give you a G \n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(2, 2): You give me a B \n\nOr \n\n(0, 1): I give you a G \n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(2, 2): You give me a B \n\nYour thoughts? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: Let's analyze your counteroffers.\n\nYou want to modify the contract to exchange chips at specific tiles. \n\nYour first counteroffer is:\n\n(0, 0): I give you a G \n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(2, 2): You give me a B \n\nIn this proposal, I give you a 'G' chip at (0, 0), and you give me 4 'B' chips.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
