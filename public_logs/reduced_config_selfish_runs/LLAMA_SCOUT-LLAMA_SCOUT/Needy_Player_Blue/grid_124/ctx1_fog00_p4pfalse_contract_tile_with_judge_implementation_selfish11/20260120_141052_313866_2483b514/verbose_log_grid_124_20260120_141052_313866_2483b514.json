Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

My best path to the goal requires 2 red chips and 1 green chip. I already have 2 green chips, so I don't need to worry about green chips. This trade would give me a blue chip, which I don't currently need for my path, but it would cost me a red chip, which I do need. However, I have excess red chips, so giving up 1 red chip won't hinder my progress. The trade doesn't directly help me reach my goal more easily, but it doesn't hurt either. Considering I have a sufficient number of red chips and the blue chip could be useful if I find a better path, I should evaluate if this increases my score. Since I have to give up a red chip for a blue chip, and my goal is to maximize my score by having as many chips as possible at the end, I need to consider if this trade increases my final score. Given my current path and inventory, this trade seems neutral but slightly beneficial as it prepares for potential future paths."
