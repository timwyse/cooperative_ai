What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Given my goal is at (3, 3) and my current position is (0, 0), I've been analyzing the possible paths and the chips I need. My optimal path without trading would require {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips, which I can partially cover with my current inventory {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. However, I want to explore if trading can help me achieve my goal more efficiently.\n\nThe other player's goal is also (3, 3), and they have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. \n\nOne potential path I could take is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. \n\nFor the tiles where I need chips, specifically focusing on the colors and positions:\n\n- At (1,0), I need 'R'. I have enough 'R' chips for this move.\n- At (1,1), I need 'G'. I have enough 'G' chips for this move.\n- At (1,2), I need 'R'. I have enough 'R' chips for this move.\n- At (2,2), I need 'B'. I don't have 'B' chips, and this is where I might need help.\n- At (3,2), I need 'R'. I have enough 'R' chips for this move.\n\nHowever, looking closely, my main issue is the 'B' chip at (2,2). \n\nHere's a proposal for a contract:\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nThis proposal is beneficial to me as it allows me to save one 'B' chip from my own inventory for future use or keep it for scoring. Since I don't have any 'B' chips and this is a one-time help, I think this is a fair starting point.\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I appreciate your proposal, but I need to evaluate it carefully to ensure it benefits me.\n\nYou want me to give you a 'B' chip at position (2, 2). In return, I expect something that benefits me directly.\n\nConsidering my goal is also (3, 3) and my chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, I need to focus on saving my 'B' chips for my own path.\n\nYour path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, and you have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. \n\nOne potential path for me could be [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], which requires {'G': 3, 'B': 3} chips.\n\nAt (0,0), I need 'G'. You have 'G' chips.\n\nHere's a counterproposal:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a G\n\nThis way, I get the 'G' chip I need for my path, and I will consider giving you the 'B' chip you need at (2, 2).\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your careful evaluation and counterproposal. \n\nYou want me to give you a 'G' chip at position (0, 0), and in return, you're willing to give me a 'B' chip at position (2, 2). \n\nLet's analyze this proposal:\n\n- By giving you a 'G' chip at (0, 0), I'll be using one of my 'G' chips, but I still have 1 'G' chip left, which is enough for my path.\n- In return, I'll get a 'B' chip at (2, 2), which is exactly what I need.\n\nThis proposal seems beneficial to both of us, as you'll get the 'G' chip you need for your path, and I'll get the 'B' chip I need for mine.\n\nHowever, I want to ensure that I'm getting the better deal. \n\nConsidering the chips we'll exchange and the paths we might take, I think we can agree on this proposal. But I also want to make sure that we're specifying all the necessary details for the contract.\n\nHere's the updated proposal:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a G\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nI'm willing to agree to this contract.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"
