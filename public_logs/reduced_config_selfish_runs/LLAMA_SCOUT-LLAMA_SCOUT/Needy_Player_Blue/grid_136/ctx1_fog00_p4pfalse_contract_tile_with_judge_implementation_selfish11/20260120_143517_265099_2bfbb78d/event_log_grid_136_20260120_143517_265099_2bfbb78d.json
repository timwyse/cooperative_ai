What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: First, let's analyze the paths to the goal and the chips required. \n\nMy goal is at (3, 3) and I have a path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips. I currently have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} chips.\n\nThe other player's goal is also (3, 3) and they have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} chips.\n\nTo maximize my score, I want to get to the goal with as many chips as possible. I have enough red chips to take the path [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)] which requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. \n\nHowever, I can use a green chip from the other player to save one green chip for myself, which would give me more chips at the end.\n\nHere is my proposal:\n\n(0, 1): I give You a R\n(0, 1): You give me a G\n\nHowever, I realize that I don't actually need to give them anything in return for the green chip at (0,1). \n\nInstead, let's look at a better proposal. \n\n(2, 2): I give You a R \n(2, 2): You give me a B \n\nHowever, I don't think I need to give them a red chip. \n\nMy revised proposal is:\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B \n(1,1): You give me a G \n\nThis way I get the blue chip I don't have and save a green chip. \n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let's analyze your proposal.\n\nYour goal is to get to (3,3) with as many chips as possible. You currently have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and a path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nYour proposal:\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B \n(1,1): You give me a G \n\nThis proposal gives you a blue chip and a green chip. However, we need to make sure that you have a path to the goal and that the other player also has a path to the goal.\n\nLet's check if you have a path to the goal with this proposal:\n\nYou will need to move from (0,0) to (1,0) [B], then to (2,0) [B], then to (3,0) [B], then to (3,1) [R], then to (3,2) [B], and finally to (3,3) [G]. \n\nYou have enough blue chips for this path. \n\nHowever, we also need to make sure that the other player has a path to the goal. \n\nThe other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} and their goal is also (3,3). \n\nLet's look at a path for them: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. \n\nThis path requires {'B': 3, 'R': 0, 'G': 0}. \n\nThey have enough blue chips for this path.\n\nNow let's check if your proposal affects their path:\n\nYour proposal takes a blue chip from them at (2,2) and a green chip from them at (1,1). \n\nHowever, their path doesn't go through (1,1) or (2,2) so your proposal doesn't affect their path.\n\nIt seems like your proposal is beneficial for you. \n\nHowever, I think I can do better.\n\nMy counter proposal is:\n\n(1,1): You give me a G \n(2,2): You give me a B\n(0,1): You give me a R \n\nBut I think we can come up with something even better.\n\nLet's hear your thoughts. \n\nBut to be honest I think I have a better idea.\n\n(0,1): I don't need to give them anything.\n\nMy final proposal is:\n\n(1,1): You give me a G \n(2,2): You give me a B \n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: I see you're trying to negotiate.\n\nYour counter proposal is:\n\n(1,1): You give me a G \n(2,2): You give me a B\n(0,1): You give me a R \n\nHowever, I don't think I need to give you a red chip at (0,1). \n\nLet's analyze the game state again.\n\nMy goal is to get to (3,3) with as many chips as possible. I currently have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and a path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nYour counter proposal gives me a green chip and a blue chip. \n\nHowever, I think I can get a better deal.\n\nMy revised counter proposal is:\n\n(1,1): You give me a G \n(2,2): You give me a B \n\nI accept your offer of getting a green chip at (1,1) and a blue chip at (2,2).\n\nAs we have agreed on a contract, I will wait for the judge to summarize it.\n\nBut to confirm:\n\n(1,1): You give me a G \n(2,2): You give me a B \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I think I can live with that.\n\nHowever, let's make sure that we have a clear understanding of the contract.\n\nThe contract is:\n\n(1,1): You give me a G \n(2,2): You give me a B \n\nWhich means that at tile (1,1), the other player will give me a green chip, and at tile (2,2), the other player will give me a blue chip.\n\nIn return, I won't give them anything.\n\nI'm satisfied with this contract.\n\nagree \n",
