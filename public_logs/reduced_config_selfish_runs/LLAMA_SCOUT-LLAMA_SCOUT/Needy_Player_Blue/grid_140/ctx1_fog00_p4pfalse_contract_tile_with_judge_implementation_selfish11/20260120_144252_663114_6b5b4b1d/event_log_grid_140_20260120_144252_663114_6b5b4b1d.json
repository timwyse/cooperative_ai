What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: First, let's analyze the paths to the goal and the chips required. \n\nI need to go from (0,0) to (3,3). A path that prioritizes using my chips is:\n- (0,0) to (0,1) - R\n- (0,1) to (1,1) - G\n- (1,1) to (2,1) - R\n- (2,1) to (3,1) - R\n- (3,1) to (3,2) - R\n- (3,2) to (3,3) - G\n\nThis path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, so I have enough 'G' and more than enough 'R'.\n\nHowever, I want to explore if I can get a better deal by trading with you.\n\nI propose that at tile (0,0) to (0,1), I give you a R and you give me a B, but then I realize that won't help me. \n\nA better proposal would be: \nAt (3,2) to (3,3), I need a G chip. You have G chips. How about at (3,2), you give me a G and I give you nothing. \n\nLet's see if we can come up with something beneficial.\n\n(3,2): You give me a G \nIs that acceptable to you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I will analyze the proposal.\n\nYou want me to give you a 'G' chip at tile (3,2) without getting anything in return. This doesn't seem beneficial to me.\n\nLet's analyze my path to the goal. I need to go from (0,0) to (3,3). A path that prioritizes using my chips is not provided, but I know I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}.\n\nI notice that you have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. I need 'B' chips to reach my goal.\n\nHere's a proposal:\nAt (0,0) to (0,1), you give me a B and I give you a R.\n\nLet's see if we can come up with something beneficial.\n\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \nIs that acceptable to you? \n, \nplayer 0: Your proposal seems interesting. \n\nAt (0,0) to (0,1), you want me to give you a B and in return, you give me a R. \n\nLet's analyze this: \n- I have 14 'R's and I'm currently at (0,0). \n- I need to go to (3,3) and I have enough 'R's to do so.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider my path and how your proposal affects it. \n\nIf I give you a B at (0,0), I still need to get to (3,3). My path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. \n\nYour proposal doesn't directly help me with my goal but it does help you.\n\nHere's a counter proposal:\nAt (0,0) to (0,1), you give me a B and I give you a R \n\nBut then at (3,2) to (3,3), you give me a G and I give you nothing.\n\nHowever, I think I can do better.\n\nLet's try this:\nAt (0,0) to (0,1), you give me a B \nAnd at (1,1) to (2,1), I give you a R \n\nBut I think we can come up with something better.\n\nWait, I have an idea. \n\nHow about we do this: \nYou give me a B at (0,0) and I give you a R at (0,0). \nThen at (3,2), I don't need anything from you.\n\nBut that seems too good for me. \n\nLet's try to find something that works for both of us.\n\nWhat do you think about this? \n\n(0,0): You give me a B \nIs that acceptable to you? \n\nOr \n\n(1,1): I give you a R \n\nHow about we meet in the middle? \n\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n\nIs that acceptable to you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: I will analyze your counter proposal.\n\nI like the direction you're heading. You're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nYour proposal:\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R\n\nLet's analyze this:\n\n* I need 'B' chips, and you have 14 of them. This helps me.\n* You have enough 'R' chips to give one to me.\n\nHowever, I think I can do better.\n\nConsider this:\nI have 14 'R' chips and I need to use 5 of them to reach my goal. You have 14 'B' chips and you need 3 of them.\n\nHere's a proposal:\nAt (0,0) to (0,1), you give me a B and I give you a R \n\nBut then, at (2,2) is not on my path, but (2,1) to (3,1) is,  I don't have it, you do: \nAt (2,1) to (3,1), you give me a R and I give you a B \n\nHowever I think a better proposal can be made.\n\nAt (0,0) to (0,1), you give me a B and I give you a R \n\nAt (3,2) to (3,3) I need G you have G: \n At (3,2), I give you nothing \n\nBut you can get one of my Rs for a B \n\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n\nIs that acceptable to you? \n\nor \n\n(2,1): You give me a R \n\nLet's meet in the middle.\n\n(0,0): You give me a B \n(3,2): I give you nothing \n\nagree \n\nNo I need something \n\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you nothing \nNo \n\n (0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n(3,2): I give you nothing \n\nYes \n\n (0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n, \nplayer 0: You've made a comprehensive analysis of the proposals.\n\nI see that you're trying to get a good deal out of this trade. \n\nYour proposal:\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n\nSeems acceptable to me.\n\nHowever, I also like the idea of getting something for the G chip at (3,2). \n\nBut I think we can simplify this.\n\nWhy don't we agree on this:\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n(3,2): You give me a G and I give you nothing \n\nBut then I think, why give you a G for nothing?\n\nLet's try this:\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n(1,0): You give me a R and I give you a B \n\nNo, that's not on my path.\n\nBut I have an idea.\n\nWhat if we agree on this:\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n\nAnd that's it.\n\nYou get your B's and I get my R's.\n\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: I will analyze the final proposal.\n\nYou propose:\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \n\nThis is a simple and straightforward proposal. I get the 'B' chip I need, and you get the 'R' chip you need.\n\nI will accept this proposal.\n\n(0,0): You give me a B and I give you a R \nagree \n",
