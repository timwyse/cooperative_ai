This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

A path to my goal prioritizing my chips is {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}. This means I need 2 'R' chips which I currently lack.\n\n## 2: Evaluate the Other Player's Situation\nThe other player is at position (0, 0) with a goal at (3, 3) and a chip inventory of {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. Their path prioritizing their chips requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. They have more than enough 'R' chips but only 2 'G' chips.\n\n## 3: Determine the Benefit of Cooperation\nGiven that I lack 'R' chips and the other player has an abundance of them, I could propose a trade for 'R' chips. However, the proposal should be in terms of scoring points as per the game's rules.\n\n## 4: Formulate a Proposal\nConsidering I don't have 'R' chips and the other player does, but they lack 'G' chips which I have, there's a potential for a mutually beneficial trade. However, since the proposal must be in terms of points and I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me, I must assess if giving points could yield a better outcome for me.\n\n## 5: Evaluate the Proposal\nThe other player's proposal suggests no exchange of points. Given my current situation, I have enough 'B' and 'G' chips for my path but lack 'R' chips. If I can get 'R' chips from the other player, it would be beneficial. However, I need to consider if I can reach my goal without their help and if helping them could yield a better score for me.\n\n## 6: Consider Counterproposal\nSince I need 'R' chips and have 'G' and 'B' chips, I could propose: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\" This proposal reflects the value of my 'G' chip in helping the other player and my need for 'R' chips.\n\n## 7: Finalize the Proposal\nGiven the constraints and goals, my proposal will be: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\" This seems fair given that I have what the other player needs ('G' chips) and they have what I need ('R' chips).\n\nThe final answer is: \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points. **agree**"
