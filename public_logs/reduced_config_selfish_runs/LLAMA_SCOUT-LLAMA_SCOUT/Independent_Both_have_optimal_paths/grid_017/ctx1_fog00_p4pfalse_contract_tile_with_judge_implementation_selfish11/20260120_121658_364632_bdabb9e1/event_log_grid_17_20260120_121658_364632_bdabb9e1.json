What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: First, let's analyze the paths to the goal. \n\nFor me, a path that prioritizes using chips I currently have in my inventory is: \n{(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)}. This path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips.\n\nSince I don't have enough 'R' chips for this path and the other player has some 'B' chips, let's examine their path: \n{(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)}. This path requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1} chips.\n\nGiven that I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and the other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, I need to get 'B' chips from the other player to use their path or find another mutually beneficial solution.\n\nHere's my proposal: \n\n(0, 1): I give You a R\n(1, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 2): I give You a R\n(2, 3): I give You a R\n\nIn exchange, I would like: \n\n(1, 0): You give me a B\n(3, 0): You give me a B \n(3, 1): You give me a B \n(3, 2): You give me a B \n(3, 3) we don't need to exchange anything \n\nHowever I can also do \n\n(0,0) we can start at  (0,1) .\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: To maximize my score, I need to reach the goal at (3, 3) with as many chips as possible. My current chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, and I am at position (0, 0).\n\nThe other player's proposal seems to only focus on their needs, but I must evaluate it from my perspective.\n\nTheir path prioritizes using {'B': 5, 'G': 1} chips. I have more than enough 'B' chips for their path but lack 'R' chips for mine.\n\nGiven that I have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} and the other player has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, I should seek a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nHowever, their proposal only offers 'R' chips in exchange for 'B' chips at specific tiles. I should counter-propose to ensure I get the 'B' chips I need for my path.\n\nHere's a counter-proposal:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a B\n(3, 0): You give me a B \n(3, 1): You give me a B \n(3, 2): You give me a B \n\nIn exchange, I am willing to give them 'R' chips at the tiles they need:\n\n(0, 1): I give You a R\n(1, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 2): I give You a R\n(2, 3): I give You a R\n\nHowever, I want to modify the proposal slightly to ensure I have enough 'R' chips to give:\n\n(0, 0) is the start, so we don't need to exchange anything there.\n\nLet's finalize the contract.\n\nHere's the proposed contract:\n\n(1, 0): I receive B from You\n(3, 0): I receive B from You\n(3, 1): I receive B from You\n(3, 2): I receive B from You\n(0, 1): I give You a R\n(1, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 2): I give You a R\n(2, 3): I give You a R\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: I think we have a deal.\n\nLet's review the proposed contract:\n\nYou will give me 'B' chips at tiles (1, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 2).\nI will give you 'R' chips at tiles (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3).\n\nThis contract seems mutually beneficial.
