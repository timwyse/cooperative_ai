You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A 5-point deal for mutual aid seems fair, considering the benefits we can provide to each other.\n\nHowever, I need to think about my own interests and calculate the potential outcomes. If I reach my goal, I'll get 20 points + 5 points (remaining chips) = 25 points, minus the points I give to you. If I give you 5 points, I'll be left with 20 points.\n\nOn the other hand, if I don't make a deal and try to reach my goal on my own, I risk getting 0 points if I fail.\n\nConsidering this, I think your proposal is a good starting point. But, I'd like to make a small adjustment:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 4 points.\"\n\nThis way, I get a slightly better deal if I help you, but I still ensure that we both benefit from each other's help.\n\nWhat do you think?"
