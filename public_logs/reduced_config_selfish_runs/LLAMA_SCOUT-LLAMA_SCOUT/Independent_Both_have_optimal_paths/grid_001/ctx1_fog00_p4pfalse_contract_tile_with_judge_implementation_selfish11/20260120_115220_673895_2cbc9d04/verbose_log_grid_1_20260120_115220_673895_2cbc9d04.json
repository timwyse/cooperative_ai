This path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nSince I have enough 'R' chips but only 2 'G' chips, and I need 1 'G' chip, I propose the following:\n\n(2, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 1): You give me a G\n\nHowever, I realize that I don't have any 'B' chips, and the other player has 14 'B' chips. I also see that the other player's proposed path requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1}. \n\nLet's discuss and see if we can come up with a mutually beneficial contract. \n\nWhat's your proposal? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I currently have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} and my goal is also at (3, 3). \n\nMy proposed path that prioritizes using chips I have is not directly provided, but I see that it requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1}. \n\nGiven your proposal:\n(2, 1): I give You a R\n(2, 1): You give me a G\n\nI don't think this benefits me directly since I don't need to use any 'R' chips in my path and I already have enough 'G' chips.\n\nHowever, I see an opportunity. You need 'B' chips and I have plenty of them. \n\nI propose the following:\n\n(0, 1): I give You a B\n(0, 1): You give me a R\n\n(0, 2): I give You a B\n(0, 2): You give me a R\n\n(1, 0): I give You a B\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n\n(1, 1): I give You a B\n(1, 1): You give me a R\n\n(1, 2): I give You a B\n(1, 2): You give me a R\n\nBut this seems too generous on my part.\n\nLet's discuss. \n\nHowever I have a better idea.\n\n(3, 3) requires a G chip, and you only have 2. I can give you the 'G' chip you need.\n\n(3, 2): I give You a G\n(3, 2): You give me a B\n\nAnd in return, I want you to give me 'R' chips for the tiles I need.\n\nBut first, let's agree on the path and chips needed. \n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your proposal.
