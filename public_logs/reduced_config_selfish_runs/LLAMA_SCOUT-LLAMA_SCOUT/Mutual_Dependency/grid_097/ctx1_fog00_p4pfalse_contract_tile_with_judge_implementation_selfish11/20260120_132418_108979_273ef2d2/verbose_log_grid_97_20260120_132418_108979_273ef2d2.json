What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: First, let's analyze the paths to the goal and the chips we both have.\n\nI need a path to (3, 3) and I have chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. A potential path for me is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] which requires {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}. I'm missing 'B': 2.\n\nYou have chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. \n\nOne possible proposal could be:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a G\n(0, 0): You give me a B\n\nHowever, I realize that giving away a 'G' might not be beneficial for me. \n\nA better proposal would be:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a B\n\nI'm only asking for 1 'B' for now and not specifying giving anything in return. \n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I need to maximize my score, and I currently have chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. My goal is also at (3, 3). A potential path for me is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] which requires {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}. I'm missing 'R': 3 and 'G': 1.\n\nI don't see any immediate benefit in giving you a 'B' for nothing. However, I do see that you have 'R': 14 and I'm missing 'R': 3. \n\nI propose:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a B\n(0, 0): You give me a R\n\nThis way, I get an 'R' which I need, and you get a 'B' which you seem to need.\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your proposal. You want:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a B\n(0, 0): You give me a R\n\nLet's analyze this proposal. If I agree to this, I will get 1 'B' and give away 1 'R'. \n\nCurrently, I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and I need {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1} for my path. With this proposal, I will have {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 13} and still need {'B': 1, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}.\n\nI like the idea of getting a 'B', but I'm not sure if giving away an 'R' is a good deal for me. I have many 'R's, but I also need to make sure I have enough for my path.\n\nHowever, I also see that you have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} and you need 'R': 3. I propose a slight modification:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a B\n(0, 0): You give me a R\n\nremains the same, but I add another term to the contract:\n\n(3, 0): You give me a R\n(3, 0): I give You a B\n\n Wait, that won't work as we are at (0,0). \n\nLet me rethink this... \n\n(0, 0): I give You a B\n(0, 0): You give me a R \n\nis actually not bad for me, but I think I can get a better deal.\n\nHow about:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a B\n(0, 0): You give me 3R\n\nThis way, I get 3 'R's which I can use for my path and you get 1 'B'. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: You're proposing:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a B\n(0, 0): You give me 3R\n\nLet's analyze this. If I agree to this, I will get 3 'R's which I need for my path, and give away 1 'B'. \n\nCurrently, I have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} and I need 'R': 3 and 'G': 1 for my path. With this proposal, I will have {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 3}.\n\nI still need 'G': 1. You have 'G': 2, so it's possible for you to give me 'G': 1.\n\nLet's modify the proposal to include the 'G' I need:\n\n(1, 0): I give You a B\n(1, 0): You give me 3R\n(3, 3): You give me a G\n(3, 3): I give You a B\n\nHowever, we are currently at (0,0), so let's adjust the proposal to reflect the correct tiles where the exchange will happen.\n\nHere's a revised proposal:\n\n(2, 0): You give me a R\n(2, 0): I give You a B\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(1, 0): I give You a B\n(3, 0): You give me a R\n(3, 0): I give You a B\n(3, 3): You give me a G\n(3, 3): I give You a B\n\nThis revised proposal meets the condition of specifying the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: Let's analyze the revised proposal.\n\nYou want:\n\n(2, 0): You give me a R\n(2, 0): I give You a B\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(1, 0): I give You a B\n(3, 0): You give me a R\n(3, 0): I give You a B\n(3, 3): You give me a G\n(3, 3): I give You a B\n\nIf I agree to this, I will get 3 'R's and 1 'G' which I need, and give away 4 'B's.\n\nLet's see how this affects my chip count:\n\nCurrently, I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and I need {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1} for my path. With this proposal, I will have {'B': 4, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}.\n\nI will have more than enough 'B's, exactly enough 'G', and more than enough 'R's. \n\nThe proposal is beneficial for me.
