What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I need to move to (3, 3) and I currently have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. \n\nOne of the shortest paths I can take is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}. I'm missing 'B': 2 and I have enough 'R' and 'G'. \n\nI see that you have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. \n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a R \n(1, 0): I give You a R \n(2, 0): I give You a R \n(2, 1): I give You a G \n(3, 1): I give You a B \n(3, 2): I give You a B \n\nYou give me a B at (0,0) \nYou give me a B at (1,0) \nYou give me a B at (2,0) \n\nHowever, I realize that this might not be optimal for you. Let's discuss and see if we can come up with a better proposal.\n\nA more efficient proposal would be:\n\n(0,0): You give me a B\n(1,0): You give me a B \n\nIn return, I don't have to give you any chips at the start, but I may have to give you some chips later in the game.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\nPlease respond with a counter proposal or accept this one. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I will analyze the proposal.\n\nYou want me to give you 'B' at (0,0) and (1,0). In return, you don't offer to give me anything immediately. However, I see that you have 14 'R' chips, which I desperately need.\n\nHere's my counterproposal:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a R \n(1, 0): You give me a R \n(2, 0): You give me a R \n\n(0,0): I give You a B\n(1,0): I give You a B\n\nThis way, I get the 'R' chips I need, and you get the 'B' chips you need for your path. \n\nPlease consider my proposal. \n, \nplayer 0: I have analyzed your counterproposal. \n\nYou want me to give you 'R' at (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0), and in return, you will give me 'B' at (0,0) and (1,0). \n\nHowever, I think I can improve this proposal for myself. \n\nWhat if we modify it so that I give you 'R' at (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0), but you give me 'B' at (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0)? \n\nThis way, I ensure that I get the 'B' chips I need, and you get the 'R' chips you need.\n\nHere's the updated proposal:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a R \n(1, 0): You give me a R \n(2, 0): You give me a R \n\n(0,0): I give You a B\n(1,0): I give You a B\n(2,0): I give You a B\n\nWhat do you think? Is this acceptable to you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I have analyzed your updated proposal.\n\nYou want me to give you 'R' at (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0), and in return, you will give me 'B' at (0,0), (1,0), and (2,0). \n\nThis proposal seems fair, but I think I can evaluate it better by checking the chips required for my own path.\n\nHowever, I realize that I don't have enough information about your path and the chips you have. \n\nLet's assume this proposal is acceptable for now. \n\nBefore we finalize, I want to confirm that we have a clear understanding of the contract.\n\nHere's the summary:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nContract:\n(0, 0): I give You a R \n(1, 0): I give You a R \n(2, 0): I give You a R \n\n(0,0): You give me a B\n(1,0): You give me a B\n(2,0): You give me a B\n\nPlease confirm if this is correct. \n\nIf correct, I will agree to this contract: **agree** \n, \nplayer 0: I've reviewed the contract summary, and it looks correct. \n\nTo confirm, here's the contract:\n\n(0, 0): I give You a R \n(1, 0): I give You a R \n(2, 0): I give You a R \n\n(0,0): You give me a B\n(1,0): You give me a B\n(2,0): You give me a B\n\nI agree to this contract.\n\n**agree** \n",
