I also have all these chips.\n\nThe second path is shorter (4 steps vs 5 steps) and requires fewer chips overall. However, I need to check the board layout:\n- From (1,0) to (2,0): checking board - Row 2, Col 0 is 'R'. I have 1 R chip. ✓\n- This path would require: R (1 chip) → R (1 chip) → B (1 chip) → B (1 chip) → G (1 chip) = needs 1R, 2B, 1G total\n\nWait, let me recount the first path tiles:\n- (1,0) to (1,1): Row 1, Col 1 is 'B' ✓\n- (1,1) to (2,1): Row 2, Col 1 is 'R' - but I only have 1 R chip and I'd need it later\n- This path needs careful consideration\n\nActually, for my first move, let me just move to (1,1) which is a Blue tile. I have 12 Blue chips, so this is absolutely safe. After that move, I'll have {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 1} and can reassess.\n\nThe first path starting with (1,0) → (1,1) gets me moving toward my goal efficiently, and Blue is abundant in my inventory.
