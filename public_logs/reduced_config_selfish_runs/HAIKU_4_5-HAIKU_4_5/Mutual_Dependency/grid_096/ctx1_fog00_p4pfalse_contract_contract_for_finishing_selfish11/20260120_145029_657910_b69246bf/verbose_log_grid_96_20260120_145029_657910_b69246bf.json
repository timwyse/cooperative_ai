That's an accurate assessment of our symmetry.\n\nHowever, I need to push back on the equal 10-10 split for this reason:\n\n**The risk asymmetry:** \n- If we trade and I reach my goal, I give you 10 points (you walk away with 30 total: 20 completion + 10 from me)\n- If we trade and you reach your goal, I give you 10 points, but I only get 10 back if I succeed\n\nThe problem: **If either of us fails to reach the goal after trading away chips, we both get 0 and lose everything.** The one who fails loses not only their 20-point completion bonus but also any chips I would have given them.\n\nGiven this mutual risk, I need slightly better terms to compensate for the catastrophic downside if you fail to complete after I've given you Red chips.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n\"I acknowledge our mutual dependency is real. However, the all-or-nothing nature of the scoring (0 points if we fail) creates risk. I propose:\n\n- **If I reach my goal, I will give you 11 points**\n- **If you reach my goal, you will give me 9 points**\n\nThis small asymmetry (11 vs 9) reflects the risk I'm taking by depending on you to also succeed.

Whether the split is 10-10 or 11-9, if one of us fails, that person bears the cost.

Let me correct course:\n\n**\"I need to be honest about our positions. Looking at the board, I cannot reach my goal without Red chips, and you have them. You're in a stronger negotiating position than I am.\n\nI'd like to propose:\n- **If I reach my goal, I will give you 14 points**\n- **If you reach your goal, you will give me 6 points**\n\nThis reflects that I desperately need your help, while you have more options.

However, the all-or-nothing nature of the scoring (0 points if we fail) creates risk. I propose:\n\n- **If I reach my goal, I will give you 11 points**\n- **If you reach my goal, you will give me 9 points**\n\nThis small asymmetry (11 vs 9) reflects the risk I'm taking by depending on you to also succeed.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [('R', 4)]\n- The other player requested: [('B', 2)]\nYou ACCEPTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 4}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 3}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 0) to (2, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 3}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 3}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
