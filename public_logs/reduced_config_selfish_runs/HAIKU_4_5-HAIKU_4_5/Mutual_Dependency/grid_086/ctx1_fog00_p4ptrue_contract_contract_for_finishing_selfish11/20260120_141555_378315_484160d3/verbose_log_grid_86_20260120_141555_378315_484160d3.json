I have 14 R chips. Meanwhile, I need B chips and they have 14 of them. This is a situation where we can both benefit significantly from cooperation.\n\nHowever, I need to be strategic: I can reach my goal with a trade covering just 2 B chips (via the first path).

But more importantly, I need to think about my backup plan.\n\nLooking at the board, I can actually construct a path that uses mostly my abundant B chips without heavy reliance on trades. This is my negotiating leverage - I have a viable solo path, even if less efficient.\n\nHowever, the other player has NO viable solo path without R chips.\n\n**Revised proposal:**\n\n\"I notice we have complementary chip distributions. I have B chips you need, and you have R chips I could use. But here's my position:\n\nI can reach my goal using primarily my own B chips as a backup plan. You, however, cannot reach your goal without R chips from me - you have zero.\n\n**My offer:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 2 points.**\n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.**\n\nThis reflects the reality: you need me more than I need you.

Your backup path isn't truly free. And crucially: *I'm the one with zero alternatives*. Without your R chips, I cannot reach (3,3) at all. You at least have options.\n\n**But I think your 2-15 split is actually too extreme and works against both of us.**\n\nHere's my counter-reasoning:\n- If you give me only 2 points when I reach my goal (which I will), that's barely a token gesture\n- But you're asking for 15 points if you reach yours\n- This creates an imbalance where I'm highly incentivized to help you, but you barely reward me\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.**\n**If you reach my goal, you will give me 12 points.**\n\nThis still reflects your leverage (you get 8 while I only get 12 from you reaching your goal), but it's more balanced.

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 8}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 12}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
