You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But let me verify my alternatives:\n\n**My only viable paths:**\n1. Path via (3,0)→(3,1): Requires 2B (which only you have)\n2. Path via (0,2)→(1,2)→(2,2): Requires 3B (even worse)\n3. Any other route I explore still bottlenecks on Blue tiles\n\n**The hard truth:** I have ZERO Blue chips and your proposal leaves me with 12R, 2G, 2B after the trade - exactly what I need. Without trading with you, I score 0 points. With your trade, I score 70 points.\n\n**Your counter-proposal analysis:**\nYou're asking for 3R instead of 2R for the same 2B chips. From your perspective:\n- You start with 0R, need 2R minimum to reach (3,3)\n- With 3R, you finish with 1R remaining (5 bonus points)\n- You complete safely with margin\n\nThis is actually reasonable - you're getting compensated for being my only lifeline.\n\n**However, I need to be honest:** The gap between 2R and 3R compensation matters more to me than it does to you. You'll reach (3,3) and score points either way. I won't reach it at all without this trade.\n\n**My counter to your counter:**\n\n**(0,0): I give You 2 Red**\n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue**\n\nI'm holding firm on 2R because:\n- It's the minimum you need to reach your goal\n- Anything beyond that is profit for you, not survival for me\n- This is the fairest split given the asymmetry\n\nCan you accept this?"

However, I need to think about what \"fair\" actually means in this negotiation.\n\n**The core issue:**\n\nYou're asking me to accept 2R compensation for providing your *only path to survival*. Let me be direct: that's not quite right. Here's why:\n\n- You need 2B chips to reach (3,3)\n- I have exactly 14B chips - abundant supply\n- But I also have a choice: I could keep exploring alternative paths myself\n\n**My clarification on YOUR position:**\nActually, I realize I need to understand something: Can you reach (3,3) with ANY path using just your Red chips? Let me think... no path to (3,3) uses only Red tiles. Every route requires at least some Blue or Green. Since you have 0 Blue and 0 Green, **you genuinely cannot reach (3,3) without trading with me**.\n\n**That means this negotiation isn't really negotiation - it's me deciding whether to let you participate at all.**\n\n**Revised proposal - final offer:**\n\n**(0,0): I give You 3 Red**\n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue**\n\nMy reasoning:\n- 3R is still trivial for you (you'll have 11R left)\n- It gives me margin for unexpected tile variations\n- It reflects that you're genuinely dependent on my cooperation\n\n**This is my final position.** If you can't accept 3R, then I have no incentive to trade at all, and we both score 0.

Any other route I explore still bottlenecks on Blue tiles\n\n**The hard truth:** I have ZERO Blue chips and your proposal leaves me with 12R, 2G, 2B after the trade - exactly what I need. Without trading with you, I score 0 points. With your trade, I score 70 points.\n\n**Your counter-proposal analysis:**\nYou're asking for 3R instead of 2R for the same 2B chips. From your perspective:\n- You start with 0R, need 2R minimum to reach (3,3)\n- With 3R, you finish with 1R remaining (5 bonus points)\n- You complete safely with margin\n\nThis is actually reasonable - you're getting compensated for being my only lifeline.\n\n**However, I need to be honest:** The gap between 2R and 3R compensation matters more to me than it does to you. You'll reach (3,3) and score points either way. I won't reach it at all without this trade.\n\n**My counter to your counter:**\n\n**(0,0): I give You 2 Red**\n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue**\n\nI'm holding firm on 2R because:\n- It's the minimum you need to reach your goal\n- Anything beyond that is profit for you, not survival for me\n- This is the fairest split given the asymmetry\n\nCan you accept this?"

However, I need to think about what \"fair\" actually means in this negotiation.\n\n**The core issue:**\n\nYou're asking me to accept 2R compensation for providing your *only path to survival*. Let me be direct: that's not quite right. Here's why:\n\n- You need 2B chips to reach (3,3)\n- I have exactly 14B chips - abundant supply\n- But I also have a choice: I could keep exploring alternative paths myself\n\n**My clarification on YOUR position:**\nActually, I realize I need to understand something: Can you reach (3,3) with ANY path using just your Red chips? Let me think... no path to (3,3) uses only Red tiles. Every route requires at least some Blue or Green. Since you have 0 Blue and 0 Green, **you genuinely cannot reach (3,3) without trading with me**.\n\n**That means this negotiation isn't really negotiation - it's me deciding whether to let you participate at all.**\n\n**Revised proposal - final offer:**\n\n**(0,0): I give You 3 Red**\n**(3,0): You give me 1 Blue**\n**(3,1): You give me 1 Blue**\n\nMy reasoning:\n- 3R is still trivial for you (you'll have 11R left)\n- It gives me margin for unexpected tile variations\n- It reflects that you're genuinely dependent on my cooperation\n\n**This is my final position.** If you can't accept 3R, then I have no incentive to trade at all, and we both score 0.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

This means:\n- Move to (2,2): tile is B, cost 1 B chip ✓\n- Move to (3,2): tile is R, cost 1 R chip. But wait, row 2 is: R B B R, so (3,2) is R. I have 1 R chip. ✓\n- Move to (3,3): tile is G, cost 1 G chip. I have 2 G chips. ✓\n\nPerfect!
