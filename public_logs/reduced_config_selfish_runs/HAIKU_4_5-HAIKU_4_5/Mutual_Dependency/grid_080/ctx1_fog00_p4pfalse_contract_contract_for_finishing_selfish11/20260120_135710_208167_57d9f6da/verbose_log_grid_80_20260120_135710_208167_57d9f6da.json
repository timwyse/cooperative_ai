The contract points matter less than chip efficiency.\n\n**Given this, my counter remains:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.**\n\nThis accounts for the fact that I'm trading away fewer precious resources (2 Blue vs your 2-3 Red), and you benefit more from reaching your goal at all.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
