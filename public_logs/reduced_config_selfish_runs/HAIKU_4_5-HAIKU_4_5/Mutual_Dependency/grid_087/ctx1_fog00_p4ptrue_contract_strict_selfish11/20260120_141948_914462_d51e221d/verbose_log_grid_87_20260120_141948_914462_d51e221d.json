This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 0, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [('R', 2)] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [('B', 2)] to Player 0.\", \"On turn 0, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 2)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 2)] to Player 1.\", \"On turn 2, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 2)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 1)] to Player 1.\", \"On turn 3, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 1)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 1)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move.
