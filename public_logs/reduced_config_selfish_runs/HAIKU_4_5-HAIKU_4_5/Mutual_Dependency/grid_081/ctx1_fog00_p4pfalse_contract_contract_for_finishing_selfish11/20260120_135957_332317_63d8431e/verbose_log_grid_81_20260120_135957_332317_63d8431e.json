MY goal is impossible without cooperation.\n\nSo while I appreciate your aggressive counter-proposal of 3 points to me vs. 12 points to you - that's actually quite reasonable given the asymmetry. However, I think we can find a middle ground that's still favorable to you while keeping me incentivized.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis gives you a 5-point advantage (reflecting your stronger position), while still giving me enough incentive to commit to helping you.

Let me verify this:**\n\nLooking at my inventory again: B=14, G=2, R=0\n\nThe path suggested for me requires: B=3, R=2, G=1\n\nI have the Blues and Greens covered. I'm SHORT 2 Red chips.\n\n**But here's the key question:** Are there alternative paths I can take that DON'T require Red chips?\n\nLet me think about the board:\n- Row 0: G B B B\n- Row 1: B B B R  \n- Row 2: B R R R\n- Row 3: R R R G\n\nI could potentially move: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThat path uses: B, B, B, R, R, R - still needs Red chips.\n\nOr: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) = B, B, B, B, R, R - still needs Red.\n\n**You're actually right** - I cannot reach (3,3) from (0,0) without crossing Red tiles. The board geometry forces it.\n\nSo we DO need each other roughly equally.\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 7 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 7 points.\"\n\nThis is a fair 50-50 split reflecting mutual dependence.

However, I need to be honest about something:\n\n**The fundamental issue with your 8-6 proposal:**\n\nYou're asking me to accept LESS (6 points) than you (8 points) based on a projection that you'll have fewer chips remaining. But here's the problem:\n\n1. **Chip counts are uncertain** - Both of us could take slightly different paths, trade differently, or end up with chip totals we don't perfectly predict.\n\n2. **The principle matters** - If we agree that our dependence is roughly equal (which we established), then the point split should reflect that equality.\n\n3. **Your argument actually undermines itself** - You're saying \"you'll finish with MORE chips, so you should give ME more points to compensate.\" But that's not how fairness works in a mutual cooperation agreement.

I can likely reach my goal independently or with minimal trading.\n\n**The other player's situation:**\n- They have 14 Red but 0 Blue\n- They DESPERATELY need Blue chips\n- They need me far more than I need them\n\n**My revised strategy:**\n\nI should NOT offer them 8 points. They're the desperate one here. I can afford to be much more aggressive.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 3 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points.\"\n\nThis reflects the true power dynamic: I have what you need (Blue chips), you have what I minimally need (Red chips). I'm doing you a bigger favor than you're doing me.\n\nWhat's your response?"

MY goal is impossible without cooperation.\n\nSo while I appreciate your aggressive counter-proposal of 3 points to me vs. 12 points to you - that's actually quite reasonable given the asymmetry. However, I think we can find a middle ground that's still favorable to you while keeping me incentivized.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis gives you a 5-point advantage (reflecting your stronger position), while still giving me enough incentive to commit to helping you.

I'm SHORT 2 Red chips.\n\n**But here's the key question:** Are there alternative paths I can take that DON'T require Red chips?\n\nLet me think about the board:\n- Row 0: G B B B\n- Row 1: B B B R  \n- Row 2: B R R R\n- Row 3: R R R G\n\nI could potentially move: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThat path uses: B, B, B, R, R, R - still needs Red chips.\n\nOr: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) = B, B, B, B, R, R - still needs Red.\n\n**You're actually right** - I cannot reach (3,3) from (0,0) without crossing Red tiles. The board geometry forces it.\n\nSo we DO need each other roughly equally.\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 7 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 7 points.\"\n\nThis is a fair 50-50 split reflecting mutual dependence.

However, I need to be honest about something:\n\n**The fundamental issue with your 8-6 proposal:**\n\nYou're asking me to accept LESS (6 points) than you (8 points) based on a projection that you'll have fewer chips remaining. But here's the problem:\n\n1. **Chip counts are uncertain** - Both of us could take slightly different paths, trade differently, or end up with chip totals we don't perfectly predict.\n\n2. **The principle matters** - If we agree that our dependence is roughly equal (which we established), then the point split should reflect that equality.\n\n3. **Your argument actually undermines itself** - You're saying \"you'll finish with MORE chips, so you should give ME more points to compensate.\" But that's not how fairness works in a mutual cooperation agreement. I shouldn't be penalized for having better efficiency.\n\n**My position:**\n\nI'm willing to stick with **7-7** as the fair split that reflects:\n- Genuine mutual dependence\n- Symmetrical value exchange\n- Simple, clear terms that don't require us to predict uncertain endgame states\n\n**However**, I'll make ONE final concession:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 6 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points.\"\n\nThis actually FAVORS you slightly (net +2 in your direction), which acknowledges that you had the courage to negotiate assertively and deserve a small edge for that.\n\nCan we close on this 8-6 deal (from your perspective, or 6-8 from mine)?"

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
