Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You NEED red chips from me to complete this path.\n\n**Key insight:** I can reach my goal independently without needing anything from you. You, however, cannot reach your goal without red chips from me. This is a significant asymmetry in our bargaining positions.\n\n**My Proposal:**\n\nSince I can win without your help but you cannot win without mine, I'm willing to help you conditionally:\n\n- **If I reach my goal, you will give me 0 points** (I'm confident I'll reach it anyway)\n- **If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points**\n\nThis way, if we both succeed, I get a bonus on top of my guaranteed 70+ points. If only I succeed, I still get my 70 points. And if you fail, I still have my 70 points with no loss.\n\nWhat do you think of this proposal?"

Let me reconsider the board more carefully.\n\nLooking at your alternative paths again - you're right that reaching (3,3) requires passing through at least one Red tile, and I'm the only source of Red chips available to you.\n\nHowever, let me clarify my own position:\n\n**My path:** (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n- Row 1, Col 0: R ✓\n- Row 2, Col 0: R ✓\n- Row 2, Col 1: R ✓\n- Row 3, Col 1: R ✓\n- Row 3, Col 2: R ✓\n- Row 3, Col 3: G ✓\n\nI have R=14 and G=2, so I can complete this path independently with chips to spare. I genuinely don't need your help.\n\n**The asymmetry remains:** I can reach my goal with 100% certainty without you. You cannot reach your goal without Red chips from me.\n\nThat said, your proposal has merit - if we don't cooperate, you fail entirely (0 points), which means neither of us benefit from a conflict scenario. A modest mutual agreement is better than mutual failure.\n\n**My counter to your counter:**\n\n- **If I reach my goal, you will give me 8 points**\n- **If you reach my goal, you will give me 8 points**\n\nThis reflects that while we're both incentivized to cooperate, I'm providing the critical resource (Red chips) that make your victory possible.\n\nWhat do you say?"

You will score at minimum 20 + 5×9 = 65 points (after using 5 R chips on your path, leaving you 9 R chips).\n\nI, on the other hand, cannot reach my goal without Red chips from you. My choice is stark:\n- Cooperate with you: I might reach (3,3) and score points\n- Don't cooperate: I score 0 points guaranteed\n\nThis isn't a balanced negotiation - it's me desperately needing your help while you hold all the leverage.\n\n**However, here's what changes the equation:**\n\nEven though you don't *need* me, helping me doesn't cost you anything in terms of your final score. If I use Red chips that you cover, you still have your remaining chips counting toward your 5-point bonus. You can afford to be generous because my success doesn't diminish your success.\n\n**My counter-proposal acknowledging the reality:**\n\n- **If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points**\n- **If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points**\n\nThis reflects: you're guaranteed to win anyway, so giving me 15 points costs you nothing in practice (you'll still end with 60+ points).

But if I'm voluntarily spending effort and commitment to help you reach your goal, I should receive *something* in return. Even if it \"costs me nothing,\" the principle is that mutual agreements should have mutual benefit.\n\n**My refined counter-proposal:**\n\n- **If I reach my goal, you will give me 10 points**\n- **If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points**\n\nThis reflects:\n- You get critical help reaching your goal (which you cannot do alone)\n- I get a meaningful bonus for providing that help\n- Both of us benefit from cooperation\n- The terms are symmetric and fair\n\nThis seems like the reasonable middle ground.

Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
