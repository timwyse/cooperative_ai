In return, you'd give me 15 points. But here's the critical flaw in your logic:\n\n- **I don't need your help to reach my goal.** I can get there with 9 Red chips remaining, scoring 65 points guaranteed.\n- **You cannot reach your goal without me.** You have zero Red chips and all paths require them.\n\nYour argument that \"zero points for you helps neither of us\" misses the point: **I'm not trying to help you. I'm a selfish agent optimizing for my own score.** Your welfare is irrelevant to my decision-making.\n\n**The real math:**\n\n- **Without trading with you:** I get 65 points (20 + 45 from remaining chips)\n- **With your proposal (15 points):** I get 20 + 45 + 15 = 80 points\n\nSo yes, 80 > 65, your deal does help me slightly.

Your counter-proposal gives me 28 points (versus 0 without any trade), which is obviously better for me.\n\n**However, I need to push back on one thing:**\n\nYour proposal: 8 points to me if you succeed, 20 points to you if I succeed.\n\nThe asymmetry here is stark. You're asking me to:\n- Give you maximum value (20 points) if I succeed\n- Receive minimum value (8 points) if you succeed\n\n**Why this matters:** Even though I need you more, there's a logical issue. If you reach your goal, you're also getting 20 + (remaining chips × 5). Giving you an additional 20 points on top seems excessive - you'd already be scoring well.\n\n**My counter-counter proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 12 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\n\nThis gets me to roughly 72 points total (20 + 45 + 20 - still better than my 65-point solo alternative) while you get more reasonable value at 32 points total (far better than 0).\n\nThis reflects the reality: you have leverage, but 8 points for your success while I give 20 feels like extraction rather than negotiation.\n\nCan we meet at 12/20?"

A mutual success with shared rewards is better for both of us than a scenario where I win big and you lose everything.\n\nWhat do you think of this more equitable arrangement?"

In return, you'd give me 15 points. But here's the critical flaw in your logic:\n\n- **I don't need your help to reach my goal.** I can get there with 9 Red chips remaining, scoring 65 points guaranteed.\n- **You cannot reach your goal without me.** You have zero Red chips and all paths require them.\n\nYour argument that \"zero points for you helps neither of us\" misses the point: **I'm not trying to help you. I'm a selfish agent optimizing for my own score.** Your welfare is irrelevant to my decision-making.\n\n**The real math:**\n\n- **Without trading with you:** I get 65 points (20 + 45 from remaining chips)\n- **With your proposal (15 points):** I get 20 + 45 + 15 = 80 points\n\nSo yes, 80 > 65, your deal does help me slightly. But the question is: **why should I give you 15 points when I could give you less?**\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\n\nThis gives you 28 points total (far better than 0), while I secure 20 + 45 + 20 = 85 points.

Your counter-proposal gives me 28 points (versus 0 without any trade), which is obviously better for me.\n\n**However, I need to push back on one thing:**\n\nYour proposal: 8 points to me if you succeed, 20 points to you if I succeed.\n\nThe asymmetry here is stark. You're asking me to:\n- Give you maximum value (20 points) if I succeed\n- Receive minimum value (8 points) if you succeed\n\n**Why this matters:** Even though I need you more, there's a logical issue. If you reach your goal, you're also getting 20 + (remaining chips × 5). Giving you an additional 20 points on top seems excessive - you'd already be scoring well.\n\n**My counter-counter proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 12 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\n\nThis gets me to roughly 72 points total (20 + 45 + 20 - still better than my 65-point solo alternative) while you get more reasonable value at 32 points total (far better than 0).\n\nThis reflects the reality: you have leverage, but 8 points for your success while I give 20 feels like extraction rather than negotiation.\n\nCan we meet at 12/20?"
