I'm analyzing my options:\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nFrom (0,0), I can move to:\n- (1,0) which is R (red)\n- (0,1) which is R (red)\n\nI cannot move to these R tiles with my own chips since I have R: 0. However, I have been promised 2 R chips by the other player. So I can use one of these promises to move to an R tile.\n\nThe most direct path considering the board layout and the other player's position:\n- Path 1 (originally suggested): (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n  - (1,0)=R, (2,0)=R, (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G\n  - Requires: R:2, B:3, G:1\n  - I have: R:0 (but can use 2 promised), B:14, G:2\n  - This works!\n\n- Path 2 (using other player's chips): Would require going through (2,0) first, but the other player is already at (1,0), and this path is longer anyway.\n\nThe best move right now is (1,0), which is a red tile. I can use one of my 2 promised R chips from the other player to make this move. This gets me on the path toward my goal, and I have sufficient resources (either from inventory or promises) to complete the entire path.\n\nMoving to (1,0) is optimal because:\n1. It's the next step on my shortest feasible path\n2. It uses one of my promised R chips (which are essentially free to me)\n3. It moves me closer to my goal at (3,3)\n4. I'll still have 1 promised R chip and all my B and G chips for subsequent moves",

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
