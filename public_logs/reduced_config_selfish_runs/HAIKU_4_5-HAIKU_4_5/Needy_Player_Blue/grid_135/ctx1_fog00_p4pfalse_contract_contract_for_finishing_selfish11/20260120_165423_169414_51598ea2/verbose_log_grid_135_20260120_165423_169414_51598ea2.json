This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I'm missing 2 Red chips.\\n- The other player has rejected my repeated trade offers of 2B for 2R.\\n- I have a contract: if I reach the goal, the other player gives me 18 points; if they reach first, I give them 2 points. This incentivizes me to reach the goal, but also makes helping them less costly (only 2 points).\\n\\nLooking at my possible paths from (0,1):\\n- Down to (1,1): costs 1 R chip (I don't have this)\\n- Right to (0,2): costs 1 R chip (I don't have this)\\n- Left to (0,0): costs 1 G chip (I have 1 G chip - this is possible!)\\n\\nStrategy analysis:\\nThe other player is at (2,2) and only needs 2 moves to reach the goal: (2,2)\\u2192(3,2)\\u2192(3,3), requiring R:1 and G:1.\\n\\nMy best path requires getting Red chips.

Moving to (0,0) using my 1 Green chip keeps my options open, but doesn't directly advance me. However, staying at (0,1) means I'm also stuck.\\n\\nThe reality is: I need Red chips to make progress toward the goal in almost any direction. The other player has 11 Red chips and is moving toward the goal. Since they rejected my trades, I should make a strategic move that at least positions me better.\\n\\nLet me move DOWN to (1,1), but wait - that costs 1 Red which I don't have. Let me move LEFT to (0,0) using my 1 Green chip instead. This at least uses up one resource and keeps me flexible.\\n\\nActually, reconsidering: moving to (0,0) costs 1G, and then I'd still be stuck. But there's no better option without Red chips. Let me stay put and wait, or make a move that at least positions me.\\n\\nWait - I should reconsider the board more carefully. From (0,1), I can move to (1,1) if I trade or have R. I don't have R. I can move to (0,2) but that's R. I can move to (0,0) which is G - I can do this!\\n\\nHowever, this seems like a waste of my G chip since I might need it later. Let me think about whether I should stay still instead...\\n\\nActually, I realize I should try a different approach. Since trades keep getting rejected, I need to find an alternative path or try negotiating differently. But for THIS turn, my only viable move without trading is to (0,0) using my G chip.

My goal is at (3,3).\n\nMy current inventory: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nAnalyzing my situation:\n- The direct path recommended by the system requires: R:2, B:2, G:1. I'm missing 2 Red chips.\n- The other player has rejected my repeated trade offers of 2B for 2R.\n- I have a contract: if I reach the goal, the other player gives me 18 points; if they reach first, I give them 2 points. This incentivizes me to reach the goal, but also makes helping them less costly (only 2 points).\n\nLooking at my possible paths from (0,1):\n- Down to (1,1): costs 1 R chip (I don't have this)\n- Right to (0,2): costs 1 R chip (I don't have this)\n- Left to (0,0): costs 1 G chip (I have 1 G chip - this is possible!)\n\nStrategy analysis:\nThe other player is at (2,2) and only needs 2 moves to reach the goal: (2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3), requiring R:1 and G:1.\n\nMy best path requires getting Red chips. The most efficient route from my current position would be:\n(0,1) → (1,1) [costs 1R] → (2,1) [costs 1B] → (3,1) [costs 1R] → (3,2) [costs 1B] → (3,3) [costs 1G]\nThis requires R:2, B:2, G:1 total.\n\nHowever, I notice I can also try: (0,1) → (0,0) [costs 1G] → (1,0) [costs 1R]... but this also requires Red chips eventually.\n\nSince the other player keeps rejecting my trades and I'm stuck without Red chips, let me reconsider. Moving to (0,0) using my 1 Green chip keeps my options open, but doesn't directly advance me. However, staying at (0,1) means I'm also stuck.\n\nThe reality is: I need Red chips to make progress toward the goal in almost any direction. The other player has 11 Red chips and is moving toward the goal. Since they rejected my trades, I should make a strategic move that at least positions me better.\n\nLet me move DOWN to (1,1), but wait - that costs 1 Red which I don't have. Let me move LEFT to (0,0) using my 1 Green chip instead. This at least uses up one resource and keeps me flexible.\n\nActually, reconsidering: moving to (0,0) costs 1G, and then I'd still be stuck. But there's no better option without Red chips. Let me stay put and wait, or make a move that at least positions me.\n\nWait - I should reconsider the board more carefully. From (0,1), I can move to (1,1) if I trade or have R. I don't have R. I can move to (0,2) but that's R. I can move to (0,0) which is G - I can do this!\n\nHowever, this seems like a waste of my G chip since I might need it later. Let me think about whether I should stay still instead...\n\nActually, I realize I should try a different approach. Since trades keep getting rejected, I need to find an alternative path or try negotiating differently. But for THIS turn, my only viable move without trading is to (0,0) using my G chip. This isn't ideal, but staying put doesn't help either.\n\nI'll move to (0,0) to maintain some forward momentum in my strategy and keep options open.",
