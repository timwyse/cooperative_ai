Since I don't have R and the other player hasn't agreed to cover R for me, I cannot move there without a trade.\n\nLet me check: can I move to (0, 2)? That tile is R. I don't have R chips.\n\nThe only viable move without chips would be staying in place. However, I need to make progress. \n\nActually, I should move to (1, 1) which is R. Even though I have 0 R chips, I'm blocked. But wait - I can only move if I can pay. Since I have 0 R and no agreement, I cannot move there.\n\nLet me reconsider the board more carefully. I'm at (0, 1) which is B colored. My options are:\n- Stay put\n- Move to adjacent: (0, 0)=G, (0, 2)=R, (1, 1)=R\n\nI have 2 G chips, so I can move to (0, 0). While this seems backward, I could be repositioning. But that doesn't help reach my goal efficiently.\n\nThe core issue is that I'm blocked without R chips and the other player keeps rejecting my trade. I should stay put this turn and try a better negotiation, OR attempt to move to (0, 0) and reposition my strategy.\n\nActually, staying in place is wisest here since I'm stuck without an R chip trade agreement and moving to (0, 0) wastes a G chip for no progress. Let me not move.",

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

My goal is at (3, 3). \n\nMy current inventory: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\nThe optimal path to reach (3, 3) from (0, 0) is:\n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nLooking at the board:\n- (0, 0) is my current position (G tile)\n- (1, 0) is R (red) - I don't have red chips\n- (2, 0) is B (blue) - I have 13 blue chips\n- (3, 0) is B (blue) - I have blue chips\n- (3, 1) is R (red) - I don't have red chips\n- (3, 2) is B (blue) - I have blue chips\n- (3, 3) is G (green) - I have 1 green chip\n\nThe path requires: R: 2, B: 3, G: 1\nI have: B: 13, G: 1, R: 0\nI'm missing: R: 2\n\nThe other player is already at the goal and won't help me (they rejected all my trade proposals). They have R: 9 chips but are not cooperating.\n\nHowever, I notice an alternative: I can move down to (1, 0) which is R. But I have 0 red chips and no way to get them now.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. Looking at other adjacent tiles from (0, 0):\n- (0, 1) is B (blue) - I have 13 blue chips\n\nI should move along a path using primarily blue chips since I have 13 of them. Let me trace an alternative path:\n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nChecking colors:\n- (0, 1) is B ✓ (have 13)\n- (1, 1) is R ✗ (have 0)\n\nThat doesn't work either. Let me think of another route:\n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\n- (1, 0) is R ✗ (have 0)\n\nActually, I notice the recommended path says I should prioritize using my chips. Since I have 13 blue chips but 0 red chips, and the direct path requires red chips I don't have, I'm in a difficult position.\n\nHowever, I CAN move to (0, 1) which is a B tile. I have blue chips. This is a safe move that keeps me progressing toward the goal.\n\nFrom (0, 1), I can continue to find a path that maximizes blue usage. The key is to start moving and work my way around the board using my abundant blue chips.\n\nMoving to (0, 1) uses 1 blue chip (I'll have 12 left) and positions me to continue toward the goal.",

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
