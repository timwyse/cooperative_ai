Shorter path mentioned: (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n   - (1,3) is R (don't have R) \n   - (2,3) is R (don't have R)\n   - This requires R chips which the other player has, but they haven't promised to cover R for me\n\nCurrent best move: (1,1) → (2,1)\n- (2,1) is an R tile\n- I don't have R chips and haven't been promised R coverage\n- This move is blocked by my lack of R chips\n\nAlternative: (1,1) → (1,2)\n- (1,2) is an R tile (from the board: Row 1: R R R R)\n- I don't have R chips and haven't been promised R coverage\n- This move is also blocked\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Looking at my adjacent tiles from (1,1):\n- (0,1) = B (I have 13 B chips) ✓\n- (2,1) = R (I don't have) ✗\n- (1,0) = R (I don't have) ✗\n- (1,2) = R (I don't have) ✗\n\nThe only move I can make is backward to (0,1), which doesn't help me reach the goal at (3,3).\n\nI'm currently stuck. I cannot move in any direction toward my goal because:\n- All paths forward require R chips which I don't have\n- The other player has R chips but hasn't promised to cover them for me\n- I need to negotiate a new arrangement to get R chip coverage\n\nHowever, I should not stay stuck. Let me reconsider: I have 3 B chips promised to the other player that haven't been used yet. The other player is at (1,2) and needs to reach (3,3). They have R chips and G chips. \n\nLooking at the situation: I'm stuck because all my moves require R. Rather than stay paralyzed, I should move toward my goal by finding a viable path. But I physically cannot move forward without R chips.\n\nLet me check if there's a creative path I'm missing - no, from (1,1) all adjacent tiles that exist are: up (0,1)=B, down (2,1)=R, left (1,0)=R, right (1,2)=R.\n\nI cannot move forward. I should stay in place and prepare to negotiate for R coverage.\"",

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
