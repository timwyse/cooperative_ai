Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But that's precisely *why* I shouldn't give them away for cheap. The fact that they're \"free\" to me doesn't obligate me to share them at a discount.\n\nHere's the fundamental issue: I have a **guaranteed 70-point path**. You have a **guaranteed 0-point path**. The negotiating power is entirely asymmetrical. You need me far more than I need you.\n\nYour counter-proposal asks me to accept only 5 points when you reach your goal. But think about it:\n- If we don't trade at all: I get 70, you get 0\n- If we trade at your proposed terms: I get 75, you get ~30\n- The \"fairness\" you're appealing to assumes we started from equal ground - we didn't\n\n**My refined counter-proposal:**\n\nIf I reach my goal, you give me **12 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you give me **3 points**.\n\nThis gives you:\n- A path to 20-25 total points (vs guaranteed 0)\n- A real chance to score\n- I get a modest bonus for enabling your only viable path\n\nYou're in a position where any points above 0 is an improvement over your alternative.

However, let me be direct about my position:\n\n**Why I'm sticking closer to my original proposal:**\n\nYou're right that those 2 Red chips cost me nothing to give you. But that's precisely *why* I shouldn't give them away for cheap. The fact that they're \"free\" to me doesn't obligate me to share them at a discount.\n\nHere's the fundamental issue: I have a **guaranteed 70-point path**. You have a **guaranteed 0-point path**. The negotiating power is entirely asymmetrical. You need me far more than I need you.\n\nYour counter-proposal asks me to accept only 5 points when you reach your goal. But think about it:\n- If we don't trade at all: I get 70, you get 0\n- If we trade at your proposed terms: I get 75, you get ~30\n- The \"fairness\" you're appealing to assumes we started from equal ground - we didn't\n\n**My refined counter-proposal:**\n\nIf I reach my goal, you give me **12 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you give me **3 points**.\n\nThis gives you:\n- A path to 20-25 total points (vs guaranteed 0)\n- A real chance to score\n- I get a modest bonus for enabling your only viable path\n\nYou're in a position where any points above 0 is an improvement over your alternative. I'm happy to help you reach that, but not at a steep discount for resources that cost me nothing.\n\nWhat do you say?"

I have zero without your help. Any points above 0 is better than my alternative. You're not obligated to subsidize me just because the chips are \"free\" for you.\n\nHowever, let me make one final counter that I think is genuinely fair:\n\n**My Final Proposal:**\n\nIf I reach my goal, you give me **8 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you give me **4 points**.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n- You get 74 points total (vs 70 baseline) - a modest improvement for minimal effort\n- I get a realistic shot at 24-28 points (vs guaranteed 0) - enough to make the trade worthwhile\n- The ratio (8:4) roughly reflects the asymmetry without being exploitative\n- You're still winning the negotiation significantly - but I'm not being completely shut out\n\nI can live with this. It acknowledges your superior position while giving me enough incentive to commit to covering 2 Red chips for you.\n\nIf you won't accept this, I understand - you have all the leverage.

From that perspective, your proposal still asks me to give away value I don't have to.\n\nLet me recalibrate to what genuinely benefits me:\n\n**My Final Proposal:**\n\nIf I reach my goal, you give me **10 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you give me **2 points**.\n\n**Why this is my final position:**\n\n- I gain 72 points total (vs 70 baseline) - a modest but real improvement for covering your 2 Red chips\n- You gain access to 20-25 points (vs guaranteed 0) - still infinitely better than your alternative\n- This reflects the true asymmetry: you're getting a lifeline, I'm getting a small bonus\n\nThe math is simple: you're asking me to help someone who has nothing to lose and everything to gain. A 2-point bonus for enabling that is actually generous given I could just refuse entirely and guarantee myself 70.\n\nI'm willing to move from my 15-point ask down to 10 points. That's my final position. This gives you enough upside to make cooperation worth your effort, while acknowledging that I'm the one holding all the cards here.\n\nDo you accept these terms?"

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color G as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 0, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('G', 2)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 2)] to Player 1.\", \"On turn 1, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 2)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 1)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough G chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation. This helps me reach my goal.\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true\n}\n\nExample of refusing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need to conserve my G chips for my own path to the goal. The agreement was made but if I agree to this then I won't have enough G chips to reach my goal.\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": false\n}\n",
