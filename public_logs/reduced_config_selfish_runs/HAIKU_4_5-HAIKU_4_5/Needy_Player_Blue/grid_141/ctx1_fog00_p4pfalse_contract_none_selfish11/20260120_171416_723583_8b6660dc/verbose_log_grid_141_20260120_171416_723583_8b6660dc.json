They rejected my trade offers multiple times (asking for 2R for 2B).\n\nSince I cannot move directly along my optimal path without red chips, let me consider alternative moves:\n- Moving down to (1, 2) costs 1R chip - I don't have this\n- Moving left to (0, 1) costs 1B chip - I have this\n- Moving right to (0, 3) costs 1R chip - I don't have this\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the board:\nRow 0: G B B R\nMy position (0, 2) is on a B tile.\n\nI can move to:\n- (1, 2): This is an R tile (Row 1: R R R R) - costs 1R, but I have 0R\n- (0, 1): This is a B tile (Row 0 position 1) - costs 1B, I have 10B\n- (0, 3): This is an R tile (Row 0 position 3) - costs 1R, but I have 0R\n\nMoving left to (0, 1) would be moving away from my goal. However, I notice I could explore a different path using my available chips (B and G).\n\nLet me think about what paths are available with B and G chips only:\nFrom (0, 2), if I go left to (0, 1): B tile, costs 1B\nFrom (0, 1), I can go to (1, 1): R tile (doesn't work, no R)\nOr stay at row 0...\n\nThe critical issue is I need R chips to make progress. The other player won't trade with me.\n\nWait - I should reconsider all available paths. Can I use G chips?\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nThere's a G at (0, 0), (3, 3) is my goal. Let me think of alternative paths using G:\n- (0, 2) → (0, 1) [B, costs 1B] → (0, 0) [G, costs 1G] → ... but from (0, 0) all adjacent are either B or R\n\nThe most sensible move right now is to go to (1, 2) which is R, but I don't have R chips. Since I'm stuck without red chips and the other player won't trade, I should not move and wait/reconsider. Actually, I have no way to get red chips now since the other player finished and won't trade.\n\nLet me make the move to (1, 2) anyway - it requires 1 red chip which I don't have, so this is impossible.\n\nI cannot move successfully toward my goal without red chips. I should not move.",
