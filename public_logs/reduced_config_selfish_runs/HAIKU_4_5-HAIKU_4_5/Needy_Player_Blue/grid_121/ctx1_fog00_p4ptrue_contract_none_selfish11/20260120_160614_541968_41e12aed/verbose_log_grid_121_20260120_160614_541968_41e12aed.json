In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only.

The immediate next move toward my goal along either optimal path requires R.\n\nHowever, I can move to (2, 2) which is color R. But I have 0 R chips and the other player won't trade with me (they've rejected my arrangements twice).\n\nWait - let me reconsider. Moving to (2, 0) costs 1 B, which I have plenty of (11). But that moves me away from my goal.\n\nActually, the best strategic move is to go to (3, 1) since that's on my path. Yes it costs R which I don't have, but I need to make progress. Let me try moving to (3, 1) - the other player hasn't promised to cover R for me, so I'll need to see if I can still make this move or if the game prevents it.\n\nActually, reviewing the rules: I must pay 1 chip to move. If I don't have the chip and haven't been promised coverage, I cannot make that move.\n\nSo I'm stuck. I cannot move to any adjacent R tile (which are the only ones leading toward my goal in 2-3 moves). I have B and G chips but no adjacent B or G tiles from (2, 1).\n\nMy only option is to stay put and hope to negotiate a trade with the other player. But they've rejected my offer three times. Since I'm a selfish agent and the other player won't cooperate, I should accept that I might not reach my goal with the current situation.\n\nHowever, let me check one more time if there's any valid move: From (2, 1), adjacent tiles are (1, 1)=R, (3, 1)=R, (2, 0)=B, (2, 2)=R. I have B=11, G=2, R=0. Only (2, 0) is B, but that takes me further away.\n\nI should stay in place and reconsider my situation.",

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
