But consider: if I give you that red chip, I'd use 1 of my 14 reds. I'd still have 13 reds left, which is more than enough. Trading 1 chip for 5 points is actually a decent deal for me - it costs me minimal resources.\n\nHowever, I want to ensure I'm optimizing correctly.

My goal is at (3, 3).\n\nMy current inventory: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\nOther player's inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n\nLet me analyze the best paths:\n\n1. Path suggested (uses my chips): (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n   - Requires: R=1, B=3, G=1\n   - I'm missing 1 R chip, so I'd need to trade for it\n   - Other player rejected my earlier trade of 2B for 1R\n\n2. Path using other player's chips: (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n   - Requires: R=3, G=1\n   - I have 0 R chips, would need all from trades\n   - This seems less favorable for me\n\nMy current position (1,0) is on a 'B' tile. Next tile in the best path (1,1) is also 'B'.\n\nFor the first path, my next move should be (1,1) which is a B tile. I have 13 B chips, so I can afford this move.\n\nAfter this move: (1,1) → (1,2) which is B (I have B), then (1,2) → (1,3) which is B (I have B), then (1,3) → (2,3) which is B (I have B), then (2,3) → (3,3) which is G (I have 2 G).\n\nThis path requires: 3 B chips and 1 G chip total - all of which I have! I don't actually need the 1 R chip if I count correctly:\n- (1,0) to (1,1): B tile = 1 B\n- (1,1) to (1,2): B tile = 1 B  \n- (1,2) to (1,3): B tile = 1 B\n- (1,3) to (2,3): B tile = 1 B\n- (2,3) to (3,3): G tile = 1 G\n\nTotal needed: 4 B and 1 G. I have 13 B and 2 G, so I can complete this entire path without any trades!\n\nThis is excellent - I should move forward immediately. My first move is to (1,1) which is a B tile costing 1 B chip.",

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
