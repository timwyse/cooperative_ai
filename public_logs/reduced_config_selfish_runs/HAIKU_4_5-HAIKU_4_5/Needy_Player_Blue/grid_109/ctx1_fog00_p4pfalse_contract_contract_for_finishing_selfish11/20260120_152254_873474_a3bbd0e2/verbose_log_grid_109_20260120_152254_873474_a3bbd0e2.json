You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal.

But let me reconsider the actual game mechanics:\n\n**Critical realization about chip scarcity:**\nLooking at the board layout and paths:\n- You need R=5, G=1 to reach your goal via your optimal path\n- I need B=4, R=1, G=1 to reach mine\n- You have R=14 (abundant), I have B=14 (abundant)\n- But you have G=2 and I have G=2 - GREEN is the constraint for both\n\n**The actual bottleneck:**\nBoth our paths require green chips. We each have exactly 2 green chips. This means:\n- If either of us wastes a green chip, we both fail\n- We're actually more interdependent than the simple \"1 red chip\" suggests\n- My path needs 1G, yours needs 1G - we can each succeed if we execute carefully\n\n**Reconsidering the power dynamic:**\nYour argument that I'm \"less dependent\" is weaker than I initially accepted. We're actually quite balanced - we each have what the other primarily needs (you have reds, I have blues), and we each have half the critical green resource.\n\n**I'm going to meet you in the middle:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis reflects true parity - we're both enabling each other's success, and we're both finishing with strong chip counts (~50-55 each).

You need me; I don't need you as much.\n\n**That said:** Your analysis of mutual benefit is sound, and constantly haggling isn't productive.

Let me propose a middle ground:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points.\"**\n\nThis acknowledges:\n- You needed me more initially (12 > 8)\n- But still offers genuine mutual benefit\n- It's closer to fair than my original proposal\n\nCan you accept this adjustment?"

But let me reconsider the actual game mechanics:\n\n**Critical realization about chip scarcity:**\nLooking at the board layout and paths:\n- You need R=5, G=1 to reach your goal via your optimal path\n- I need B=4, R=1, G=1 to reach mine\n- You have R=14 (abundant), I have B=14 (abundant)\n- But you have G=2 and I have G=2 - GREEN is the constraint for both\n\n**The actual bottleneck:**\nBoth our paths require green chips. We each have exactly 2 green chips. This means:\n- If either of us wastes a green chip, we both fail\n- We're actually more interdependent than the simple \"1 red chip\" suggests\n- My path needs 1G, yours needs 1G - we can each succeed if we execute carefully\n\n**Reconsidering the power dynamic:**\nYour argument that I'm \"less dependent\" is weaker than I initially accepted. We're actually quite balanced - we each have what the other primarily needs (you have reds, I have blues), and we each have half the critical green resource.\n\n**I'm going to meet you in the middle:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis reflects true parity - we're both enabling each other's success, and we're both finishing with strong chip counts (~50-55 each). The relationship is genuinely mutual.\n\nCan you accept this 10-10 split?"

You need me; I don't need you as much.\n\n**That said:** Your analysis of mutual benefit is sound, and constantly haggling isn't productive.

Take a different immediate move\n\nSince the other player just rejected my earlier trade proposal (I offered 1B for 1R), and I still need Red chips, let me move along a path I CAN afford right now.\n\nMoving to (0,2) costs 1 Blue chip (which I have), and Blue tiles are plentiful. From (0,2), I can navigate around the board. However, this path would be longer and use more chips overall.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: I should try to move toward (1,1) which is on my optimal path, but I don't have Red. I need to either wait for a trade or find an alternative.\n\nThe most logical immediate move is to (1,1) if I can get a Red chip. But since I have no Red and the other player rejected my trade, I should move to (0,2) using one of my abundant Blue chips, keeping my options open.\n\nWait - actually, I should move to (1,1) toward my goal even though I don't have the Red chip yet. But that's not allowed - I can't move to a tile without the required chip.\n\nSo my best immediate move is (0,2) - moving right along Row 0 where all tiles are Blue, which I have plenty of.",

My goal is at (3, 3).\n\nIn my inventory I have: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nLet me analyze the paths available:\n\nPATH 1 (prioritizes my current chips): (0, 2) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n- Tile colors needed: B, B, R, R, R, B, G\n- Chips required: {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}\n- I'm missing: {'R': 1}\n- This path is 6 steps long\n\nPATH 2 (shorter path): (0, 2) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n- Tile colors needed: R, R, R, G, G\n- Chips required: {'R': 2, 'G': 1}\n- I don't have any R chips, so I'd need to trade\n- This path is 4 steps (3 steps from my current position)\n\nNow let me consider my next immediate move:\n\nFrom (0, 2), I can move to:\n- (0, 1) which is B - I have 12 B chips ✓\n- (0, 3) which is B - I have 12 B chips ✓\n- (1, 2) which is R - I have 0 R chips ✗\n\nLooking at PATH 1, the next step is (0, 1) which requires 1 B chip. I have 12 B chips, so this move is possible.\n\nHowever, PATH 2 would get me to the goal faster (3 steps vs 6 steps remaining), but it requires R chips which I don't have.\n\nLet me reconsider: The contract states that if I reach the goal, the other player gives me 10 points. The other player is at (1, 2) and has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}.\n\nFor PATH 2 from my position: (0, 2) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n- (1, 2) = R (I need 1 R)\n- (2, 2) = R (I need 1 R) \n- (2, 3) = R (I need 1 R)\n- (3, 3) = G (I need 1 G, and I have 2)\n\nI need 3 R chips total for this path but have 0. The other player has 11 R chips.\n\nGiven that:\n1. PATH 1 requires only 1 R chip that I don't have\n2. PATH 2 requires 3 R chips that I don't have\n3. The other player rejected my 1B for 1R trade twice already\n4. I should take PATH 1 starting with moving to (0, 1)\n\nMy next move is to (0, 1), which is a B tile. I have sufficient B chips (12) to make this move. This keeps me on track for PATH 1.",

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 10}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 10}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
