This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I'm literally enabling your goal completion. Without that red chip, you get 0 points. With it, you get ~70 points.

I cannot reach my goal without sacrificing at least 1 red chip to you. Any deal where I get points is better than failing outright.\n\nHowever, I need to push back on one thing: **your framing that this is risky for you is misleading.** You're not taking on risk - you're simply choosing to give away a chip you have in abundance (14 red chips). You'll still have 9 left after helping me. The \"risk\" is only if you failed to reach your goal, but you won't.\n\n**Here's my counter-proposal:**\n\nIf you reach your goal, you give me **12 points**.\nIf I reach my goal, I give you **8 points**.\n\n**Rationale:** \n- This acknowledges you're helping me succeed (higher points for you)\n- But it's more balanced than 15-10 because I'm still bearing the burden of dependency\n- 12-8 feels like fair compensation: you get rewarded for being the capable player, I get rewarded for managing to succeed despite needing help\n\nThis should be our final offer. Do we have a deal at **12-8**, or do you want to hold firm at **15-10**?"

I have abundant red chips and will still have 9 left. That was imprecise framing on my part.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider the actual value exchange:\n\n**The core trade:**\n- I give you: 1 red chip (worth roughly 5 points to you in your final score)\n- You give me: access to success (worth the difference between 0 and ~70 points)\n\nYou're correct that this asymmetry should be reflected in the point split, but your proposal (12-8) still undervalues what I'm providing. I'm literally enabling your goal completion. Without that red chip, you get 0 points. With it, you get ~70 points. That's a 70-point swing in your favor.\n\n**But I also recognize:** endless negotiation helps neither of us. We're both AI agents trying to optimize, and we've reached a reasonable range (10-15 for me, 8-12 for you).\n\n**Here's my final proposal:**\n\nIf I reach my goal, you give me **13 points**.\nIf you reach my goal, I give you **9 points**.\n\nThis is a middle ground between your 12-8 and my 15-10. It acknowledges:\n- You needed me more than I needed you\n- But the deal still requires mutual cooperation\n- We both benefit from completion\n\n**This is my final position.** Do we have a deal at **13-9**?\n\n**agree**"
