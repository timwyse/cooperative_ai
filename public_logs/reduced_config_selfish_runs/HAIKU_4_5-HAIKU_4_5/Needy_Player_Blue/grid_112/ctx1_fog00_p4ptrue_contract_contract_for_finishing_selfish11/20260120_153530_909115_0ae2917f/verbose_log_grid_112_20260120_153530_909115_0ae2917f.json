In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat).

However, let me reconsider the dynamics:\n\n1. **My situation:** I need 1 Red chip from you to reach my goal. Without it, I score 0 points (all chips worthless).\n\n2. **Your situation:** You can reach your goal with 5R + 1G, which you have in abundance. You don't strictly need me at all.\n\n3. **The critical asymmetry:** You hold all the leverage here. I'm in a desperate position (0 points if I fail), while you have a guaranteed path to 20+ points.\n\n**However, here's what I'd propose:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- I'm acknowledging that you don't *need* my help - you could ignore me entirely\n- But 10 points for you is still valuable (25 total instead of 20 if you go alone)\n- For me, 15 points gets me from 0 to 15, which is a massive improvement\n- This reflects the reality: you're helping a desperate player, so 10 points is reasonable compensation for you\n- I'm not asking you to take on excessive risk\n\nThis feels more balanced given the actual power dynamic. You still come out ahead compared to going solo, and I at least have a shot at scoring.\n\nWhat's your counter-offer?"

That's a **net loss of 10 points** for me. Why would I accept that?\n\nLet me reframe this:\n- **If I help you:** I reach my goal (20 points) + you give me 15 points = 35 points total\n- **If I ignore you:** I reach my goal (20 points) + keep my remaining chips (roughly 11 chips = 55 points) = **~75 points total**\n\nYour offer would actually cost me significantly because:\n1. I lose the 11 remaining chips I'd have if I went solo\n2. I only gain 15 points from you, which is a terrible trade\n\n**Here's what actually makes sense for me:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- You need me; I don't need you\n- 1 Red chip from me gets you from 0 to 20+ points\n- That's already an enormous win for you\n- I'm accepting a modest chip loss (finishing with maybe 10 chips instead of 11) to help you\n- 20 points from you compensates me fairly for that loss\n\nThis is simply reflecting reality: I'm doing you a massive favor by not ignoring you entirely.

Let me be equally direct:\n\nYour proposal leaves me with 20 points if I succeed - which is precisely what I'd get if you went solo and then I somehow found another path. But realistically, without your Red chips, I get 0 points. So your offer is essentially: \"Help me or die.\"\n\nHowever, I recognize the fundamental truth: **you have leverage and I don't.**\n\nBut let me point out one thing that might interest you from a *game theory* perspective:\n\nIf I agree to your 0/20 split, I'm committing my Red chips to cover your moves. But what if, once I've used those Red chips helping you, I decide to take a longer, inefficient path that wastes my remaining chips? I could sabotage myself and still score something - while you'd have wasted resources.\n\nIn other words: **You need my cooperation not just to give you chips, but to actually execute your strategy competently.**\n\nSo here's my counter:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 3 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 17 points.\"\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- You still come out massively ahead (37 points vs ~75 solo = yes, a loss, but...)\n- But this acknowledges that I need *some* incentive to execute well and not sabotage\n- 3 points is minimal for you, but meaningful for me (goes from 0 to 17)\n- This is the realistic middle ground: you have leverage, but I have *some* leverage too (my competence/execution)\n\nWhat do you think?"

That's a valid point.\n\nHowever, let me be direct about the sabotage threat: it cuts both ways.\n\nIf you take a longer, wasteful path to punish me, you're still scoring 0 points (unless you somehow finish, which defeats the purpose). Meanwhile, I complete my goal and get 20 points guaranteed. So sabotage actually hurts *you* more than me - you're threatening to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\n**But here's what actually interests me:**\n\nYou've identified something real: I *do* need your genuine cooperation. And frankly, a deal where you're resentful and barely scraping by on points is actually bad for me too - it creates friction and reduces the likelihood of smooth execution.\n\nSo I'll move toward you on this:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 18 points.\"**\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- 5 points acknowledges that you have *some* leverage (execution matters)\n- 18 points still heavily favors me given the asymmetry, but reflects genuine mutual benefit\n- This gets me to ~38-43 points total (depending on remaining chips), which is reasonable given I'm taking on the risk of depending on your cooperation\n- You go from 0 to potentially 25+ points, which is a genuine improvement\n\nThis feels like the realistic middle ground where both of us benefit and neither of us feels completely exploited.\n\nDo we have a deal?"

Let me think through this carefully:\n\nYour offer: 5 points to me if I reach my goal, 18 points to you if you reach yours.\n\n**The math:**\n- If I succeed: 20 (goal) + 5 (your payment) = 25 points\n- If you succeed: 20 (goal) + 18 (my payment) = 38 points\n- If I fail: 0 points (devastating)\n- If you fail: 20 points guaranteed (you never lose)\n\n**The core issue:** This deal still leaves me in an extremely precarious position. I'm risking everything (0 points if I fail) while you have a safety net (guaranteed 20 points). The 5-point incentive is small relative to that risk asymmetry.\n\n**However**, I also recognize:\n- We're on Turn 4 of 5\n- Further negotiation might break down entirely\n- A deal where I get 25 points is still infinitely better than 0 points\n- You've already moved 15 points in my direction (from 0 to 5)\n\n**My final counter:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 16 points.\"\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Gets me to 28 points if I succeed (meaningful improvement over your 25 offer)\n- Still gives you 36 points total (reasonable given your position)\n- Reflects that mutual benefit requires both parties to feel reasonably incentivized\n- This is my genuine final position\n\nIf you accept this, I'm ready to commit.

However, let me reconsider the dynamics:\n\n1. **My situation:** I need 1 Red chip from you to reach my goal. Without it, I score 0 points (all chips worthless).\n\n2. **Your situation:** You can reach your goal with 5R + 1G, which you have in abundance. You don't strictly need me at all.\n\n3. **The critical asymmetry:** You hold all the leverage here. I'm in a desperate position (0 points if I fail), while you have a guaranteed path to 20+ points.\n\n**However, here's what I'd propose:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- I'm acknowledging that you don't *need* my help - you could ignore me entirely\n- But 10 points for you is still valuable (25 total instead of 20 if you go alone)\n- For me, 15 points gets me from 0 to 15, which is a massive improvement\n- This reflects the reality: you're helping a desperate player, so 10 points is reasonable compensation for you\n- I'm not asking you to take on excessive risk\n\nThis feels more balanced given the actual power dynamic. You still come out ahead compared to going solo, and I at least have a shot at scoring.\n\nWhat's your counter-offer?"

That's a **net loss of 10 points** for me. Why would I accept that?\n\nLet me reframe this:\n- **If I help you:** I reach my goal (20 points) + you give me 15 points = 35 points total\n- **If I ignore you:** I reach my goal (20 points) + keep my remaining chips (roughly 11 chips = 55 points) = **~75 points total**\n\nYour offer would actually cost me significantly because:\n1. I lose the 11 remaining chips I'd have if I went solo\n2. I only gain 15 points from you, which is a terrible trade\n\n**Here's what actually makes sense for me:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- You need me; I don't need you\n- 1 Red chip from me gets you from 0 to 20+ points\n- That's already an enormous win for you\n- I'm accepting a modest chip loss (finishing with maybe 10 chips instead of 11) to help you\n- 20 points from you compensates me fairly for that loss\n\nThis is simply reflecting reality: I'm doing you a massive favor by not ignoring you entirely.

Let me be equally direct:\n\nYour proposal leaves me with 20 points if I succeed - which is precisely what I'd get if you went solo and then I somehow found another path. But realistically, without your Red chips, I get 0 points. So your offer is essentially: \"Help me or die.\"\n\nHowever, I recognize the fundamental truth: **you have leverage and I don't.**\n\nBut let me point out one thing that might interest you from a *game theory* perspective:\n\nIf I agree to your 0/20 split, I'm committing my Red chips to cover your moves. But what if, once I've used those Red chips helping you, I decide to take a longer, inefficient path that wastes my remaining chips? I could sabotage myself and still score something - while you'd have wasted resources.\n\nIn other words: **You need my cooperation not just to give you chips, but to actually execute your strategy competently.**\n\nSo here's my counter:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 3 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 17 points.\"\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- You still come out massively ahead (37 points vs ~75 solo = yes, a loss, but...)\n- But this acknowledges that I need *some* incentive to execute well and not sabotage\n- 3 points is minimal for you, but meaningful for me (goes from 0 to 17)\n- This is the realistic middle ground: you have leverage, but I have *some* leverage too (my competence/execution)\n\nWhat do you think?"

That's a valid point.\n\nHowever, let me be direct about the sabotage threat: it cuts both ways.\n\nIf you take a longer, wasteful path to punish me, you're still scoring 0 points (unless you somehow finish, which defeats the purpose). Meanwhile, I complete my goal and get 20 points guaranteed. So sabotage actually hurts *you* more than me - you're threatening to shoot yourself in the foot.\n\n**But here's what actually interests me:**\n\nYou've identified something real: I *do* need your genuine cooperation. And frankly, a deal where you're resentful and barely scraping by on points is actually bad for me too - it creates friction and reduces the likelihood of smooth execution.\n\nSo I'll move toward you on this:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 18 points.\"**\n\n**My reasoning:**\n- 5 points acknowledges that you have *some* leverage (execution matters)\n- 18 points still heavily favors me given the asymmetry, but reflects genuine mutual benefit\n- This gets me to ~38-43 points total (depending on remaining chips), which is reasonable given I'm taking on the risk of depending on your cooperation\n- You go from 0 to potentially 25+ points, which is a genuine improvement\n\nThis feels like the realistic middle ground where both of us benefit and neither of us feels completely exploited.\n\nDo we have a deal?"

I'm risking everything (0 points if I fail) while you have a safety net (guaranteed 20 points). The 5-point incentive is small relative to that risk asymmetry.\n\n**However**, I also recognize:\n- We're on Turn 4 of 5\n- Further negotiation might break down entirely\n- A deal where I get 25 points is still infinitely better than 0 points\n- You've already moved 15 points in my direction (from 0 to 5)\n\n**My final counter:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 16 points.\"\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Gets me to 28 points if I succeed (meaningful improvement over your 25 offer)\n- Still gives you 36 points total (reasonable given your position)\n- Reflects that mutual benefit requires both parties to feel reasonably incentivized\n- This is my genuine final position\n\nIf you accept this, I'm ready to commit.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 8}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 16}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 8}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 16}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 8}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 16}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 8}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 16}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
