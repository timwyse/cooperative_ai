My goal is at (3, 3).\n\nMy inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nLet me analyze the best path options:\n\nOption 1 (shortest path using my chips): (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Tiles: G → R → B → B → B → B → G\n- Required: R: 1, B: 4, G: 1\n- Problem: I need 1 R but have 0 R chips. The other player rejected my trade offer.\n\nOption 2 (path favoring other player's chips): (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- But I'm at (0,0), so I'd need to get to (2,0) first\n- This requires moving down, which costs more initial moves\n\nCurrent situation: I have 14 B chips and 2 G chips. I'm missing R chips for the shortest path. The other player rejected my earlier trade proposal.\n\nFor my next move from (0, 0), my options are:\n- (0, 1): Color R (I don't have R)\n- (1, 0): Color R (I don't have R)\n\nBoth adjacent tiles are R. However, looking at the board more carefully:\nRow 0: G R B B\nSo (0,1) is R.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. Let me look for a path using only B and G chips:\n- From (0,0) which is G, I can move to (0,1) if I pay R (don't have)\n- Or move to (1,0) if I pay R (don't have)\n\nWait, the board shows row 0 starts with G. So (0,0) is on a G tile. Let me trace adjacent moves:\n- (0,1) = R\n- (1,0) = R\n\nBoth neighbors require R. However, I notice I could go around: (0,0) → (1,0) costs R, but if I could get to positions with B...\n\nActually, looking at the alternative path that favors the other player's chips, even though it requires trading, I'm stuck because all my adjacent moves require R chips I don't have.\n\nThe critical issue: I rejected a trade that would have given me R chips. Now I'm immobilized. Let me reconsider my options.\n\nSince I cannot move without R chips, and I don't have them, I should stay put and wait/trade. But wait - I should move if possible to get closer. Let me check if moving to (0,1) or (1,0) is possible by any means. They both require R, and I have 0 R chips, with no active agreement to have them covered.\n\nI'm stuck. I cannot move. I must stay at (0,0) and hope to negotiate for R chips eventually, or find an alternative path. But actually, both my neighbors require R, so I cannot move anywhere from here without R chips.\n\nThe mistake was rejecting the trade.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
