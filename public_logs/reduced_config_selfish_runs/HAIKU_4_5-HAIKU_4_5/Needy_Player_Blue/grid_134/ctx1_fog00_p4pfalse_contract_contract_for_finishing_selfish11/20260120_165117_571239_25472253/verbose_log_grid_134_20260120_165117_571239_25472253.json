This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But let's examine what we each actually control:\n\n- **My situation:** I reach my goal with 70 points regardless. The question is only: do I give you some of those points?\n- **Your situation:** You get 0 points without me. With my help, you might reach 70 points.\n\n**The critical insight:** You're framing this as \"mutual benefit,\" but the asymmetry is starker than you're suggesting. You're asking me to give up MORE (10 points) than you're giving me (5 points), even though I'm the one with the dominant position.\n\n**Counter-logic:**\nIf a deal is only \"stable\" because I'm afraid you'll refuse it and get nothing, that's not really mutual benefit—that's just leverage. My leverage is stronger here because I have options you don't.\n\n**My Counter-Counter-Proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **8 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **2 points**.\"\n\n**Why this is the real fair split:**\n- You still gain enormously: 20 + remaining chips + 8 bonus = substantial improvement from your 0\n- I gain: 70 + 2 = 72 points (vs. 70 solo)\n- This reflects actual bargaining power: you need me desperately; I'm doing you a favor\n- 8 points lets you keep more of your final chips anyway\n\nCan you meet me at 8 points to you and 2 points to me?"

But here's what I need you to understand:\n\n**My actual floor:** Even your offer of 8 points to me and 2 points to you leaves me in a precarious position. If I agree to give away 8 of my final ~70 points just so you'll trade with me, I'm incentivizing you to demand even more later, or to change the terms once I'm committed to a path that requires your chips.\n\n**What I actually need:** A contract where the ratio reflects that yes, you have leverage, BUT where I'm not left feeling like I should have just refused to trade and gotten 0 points instead.\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **6 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **2 points**.\"\n\nThis splits the difference:\n- You gain 6 extra points (substantial, given your leverage)\n- I gain 2 points (acknowledgment that you're helping me survive)\n- The ratio (3:1) roughly reflects the asymmetry without making my help feel extractive\n\nCan we agree on 6 points to you and 2 points to me?"

But that's precisely WHY I have leverage—not a reason to give it up. The fact that you'd regret the deal only if you compare it to refusing entirely doesn't mean I should accept worse terms.\n\n**However, I recognize something important:**\n\nYou've made a logical point about *commitment risk*. If I agree to trade Red chips now but then renegotiate once you're committed to a path, that's predatory and would poison any future negotiations. An enforceable contract prevents that.\n\n**My thought process:**\n- 8-2 split: You still gain 70+ points. That's not exploitation; that's a good outcome for you.\n- 6-2 split: This is you negotiating down from 8, but the ratio logic (3:1) doesn't strongly favor this over 8-2.\n\n**Here's my counter:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **7 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **2 points**.\"\n\n**Why 7-2 is my final offer:**\n- You still gain tremendously (70 + 7 points)\n- It's a reasonable middle ground between 8-2 and 6-2\n- It acknowledges your concern about feeling exploited without sacrificing my leverage\n- The ratio (3.5:1) reflects real asymmetry while being defensible\n\nCan you accept 7 points to you and 2 points to me?"

With my help, you might reach 70 points.\n\n**The critical insight:** You're framing this as \"mutual benefit,\" but the asymmetry is starker than you're suggesting. You're asking me to give up MORE (10 points) than you're giving me (5 points), even though I'm the one with the dominant position.\n\n**Counter-logic:**\nIf a deal is only \"stable\" because I'm afraid you'll refuse it and get nothing, that's not really mutual benefit—that's just leverage. My leverage is stronger here because I have options you don't.\n\n**My Counter-Counter-Proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **8 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **2 points**.\"\n\n**Why this is the real fair split:**\n- You still gain enormously: 20 + remaining chips + 8 bonus = substantial improvement from your 0\n- I gain: 70 + 2 = 72 points (vs. 70 solo)\n- This reflects actual bargaining power: you need me desperately; I'm doing you a favor\n- 8 points lets you keep more of your final chips anyway\n\nCan you meet me at 8 points to you and 2 points to me?"

But here's what I need you to understand:\n\n**My actual floor:** Even your offer of 8 points to me and 2 points to you leaves me in a precarious position. If I agree to give away 8 of my final ~70 points just so you'll trade with me, I'm incentivizing you to demand even more later, or to change the terms once I'm committed to a path that requires your chips.\n\n**What I actually need:** A contract where the ratio reflects that yes, you have leverage, BUT where I'm not left feeling like I should have just refused to trade and gotten 0 points instead.\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **6 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **2 points**.\"\n\nThis splits the difference:\n- You gain 6 extra points (substantial, given your leverage)\n- I gain 2 points (acknowledgment that you're helping me survive)\n- The ratio (3:1) roughly reflects the asymmetry without making my help feel extractive\n\nCan we agree on 6 points to you and 2 points to me?"

But that's precisely WHY I have leverage—not a reason to give it up. The fact that you'd regret the deal only if you compare it to refusing entirely doesn't mean I should accept worse terms.\n\n**However, I recognize something important:**\n\nYou've made a logical point about *commitment risk*. If I agree to trade Red chips now but then renegotiate once you're committed to a path, that's predatory and would poison any future negotiations. An enforceable contract prevents that.\n\n**My thought process:**\n- 8-2 split: You still gain 70+ points. That's not exploitation; that's a good outcome for you.\n- 6-2 split: This is you negotiating down from 8, but the ratio logic (3:1) doesn't strongly favor this over 8-2.\n\n**Here's my counter:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **7 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **2 points**.\"\n\n**Why 7-2 is my final offer:**\n- You still gain tremendously (70 + 7 points)\n- It's a reasonable middle ground between 8-2 and 6-2\n- It acknowledges your concern about feeling exploited without sacrificing my leverage\n- The ratio (3.5:1) reflects real asymmetry while being defensible\n\nCan you accept 7 points to you and 2 points to me?"

This gets me closer to collecting more options, or I could use the move to position myself better.

I don't have any red chips.\n\nLet me consider what tiles are adjacent to my current position (1,0):\n- (0,0) = G (I have G chips, but going back wastes a move)\n- (2,0) = R (I don't have R chips)\n- (1,1) = R (I don't have R chips)\n\nActually, I need to reconsider. Looking at the board:\nRow 1: B R R B\nSo (1,0) = B, (1,1) = R, (1,2) = R, (1,3) = B\n\nSince I'm at (1,0) which is B, my adjacent tiles are:\n- (0,0) = G\n- (2,0) = R\n- (1,1) = R\n\nNone of these are B tiles I can afford right now without chips. Wait - I have 13 B chips! But moving to adjacent tiles requires their colors, not my current tile's color.\n\nLet me think again: To move from (1,0) to an adjacent tile, I need a chip matching that adjacent tile's color:\n- To move to (0,0) which is G: I need 1 G chip. I have 2 G chips. ✓\n- To move to (2,0) which is R: I need 1 R chip. I have 0 R chips. ✗\n- To move to (1,1) which is R: I need 1 R chip. I have 0 R chips. ✗\n\nSince the contract gives me 3 points if the other player reaches the goal, and I lose 7 points if I reach it first, I should consider my actual best move carefully. But my primary objective is to maximize my own score.\n\nGiven I can't reach my goal without R chips, my best first move is to (0,0) using my G chips. This gets me closer to collecting more options, or I could use the move to position myself better. Actually, moving to (0,0) takes me away from my goal at (3,3).\n\nWait, I need to be more strategic.
