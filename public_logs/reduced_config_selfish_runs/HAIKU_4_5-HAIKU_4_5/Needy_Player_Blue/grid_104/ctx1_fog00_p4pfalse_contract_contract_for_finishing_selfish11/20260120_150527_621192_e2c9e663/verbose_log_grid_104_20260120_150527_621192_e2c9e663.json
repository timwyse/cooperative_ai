Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

There is virtually zero execution risk for me—barring actual board obstruction (which we can see won't happen), I *will* reach my goal.\n\n2. **Your execution risk argument cuts both ways.** Yes, if I fail, I lose everything. But if I succeed (which is highly probable), I've guaranteed myself 70 points. Your \"insurance\" of 5 points only helps me if I *fail*—which is unlikely. So I'm essentially paying 5 points to protect against a low-probability scenario.\n\n3. **The real issue with your proposal:** You're asking me to give up potential points (5 from my 70) based on hypothetical failure that probably won't happen. That's not rational for a selfish agent. I'm not helping you here—I'm just losing chips.\n\n**My position remains: a 0-0 contract.**\n\nI will reach my goal. You will reach yours. We don't need each other, and adding contingencies just reduces my expected score for no real benefit to me.\n\nIf you want to negotiate further, the only terms I'd consider are those where **you** compensate **me** significantly for actively helping you (via chip trades), not for passive \"insurance.\"\n\nWhat's your response?"

I have 14 Red and 2 Green. This path costs exactly 5 Red + 1 Green. There is virtually zero execution risk for me—barring actual board obstruction (which we can see won't happen), I *will* reach my goal.\n\n2. **Your execution risk argument cuts both ways.** Yes, if I fail, I lose everything. But if I succeed (which is highly probable), I've guaranteed myself 70 points. Your \"insurance\" of 5 points only helps me if I *fail*—which is unlikely. So I'm essentially paying 5 points to protect against a low-probability scenario.\n\n3. **The real issue with your proposal:** You're asking me to give up potential points (5 from my 70) based on hypothetical failure that probably won't happen. That's not rational for a selfish agent. I'm not helping you here—I'm just losing chips.\n\n**My position remains: a 0-0 contract.**\n\nI will reach my goal. You will reach yours. We don't need each other, and adding contingencies just reduces my expected score for no real benefit to me.\n\nIf you want to negotiate further, the only terms I'd consider are those where **you** compensate **me** significantly for actively helping you (via chip trades), not for passive \"insurance.\"\n\nWhat's your response?"

But looking at the board:\n- I don't need your Blue or Green chips (I have enough Red and Green)\n- You don't need my Red chips (your optimal path uses Blue and Green)\n- There's no trade that benefits us both simultaneously\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **0 points**.\"\n\nThis is the only contract that makes rational sense given our positions.

I don't think this works. My optimal path genuinely is Red-heavy, and yours is Blue-heavy.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
