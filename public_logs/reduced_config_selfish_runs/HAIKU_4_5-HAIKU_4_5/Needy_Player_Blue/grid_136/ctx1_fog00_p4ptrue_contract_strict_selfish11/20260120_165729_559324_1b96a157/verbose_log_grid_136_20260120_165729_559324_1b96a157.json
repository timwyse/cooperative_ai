Path to the right first: (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires B, R, R, R, R, G. This requires 4 R chips but I'm only covered for 2.\n\nMy immediate next move should be to (2, 0), which is a red tile. According to the board layout, row 2 is all R tiles. The color at (2, 0) is R. Since I have been promised R chip coverage from the other player (up to 2 times), I can afford to step on this R tile without using my own chips.\n\nThis move is strategic because:\n- It gets me closer to the goal (from row 1 to row 2)\n- It leverages the R chip coverage I've already secured from the other player\n- From (2,0), I can continue down the path toward (3,0) and eventually (3,3)",

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
