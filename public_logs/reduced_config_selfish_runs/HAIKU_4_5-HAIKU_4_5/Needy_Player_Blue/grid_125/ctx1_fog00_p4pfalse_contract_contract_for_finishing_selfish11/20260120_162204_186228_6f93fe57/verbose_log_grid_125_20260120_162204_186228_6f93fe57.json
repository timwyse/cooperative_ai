Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

If we both succeed:\n- You get: 75 + 12 = 87 points\n- I get: 70 + 8 = 78 points\n\nThat's a 9-point gap in your favor, when the actual independent position only had a 5-point gap.\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 9 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 11 points.**\n\nThis:\n- Acknowledges your slight chip advantage (you get net +2 from cooperation)\n- Still gives me a modest gain (+1 net) for taking on the cooperation risk\n- Keeps the gap reasonable and reflects the 5-point independent difference\n- Is more balanced than your 8-12 proposal\n\nThis feels fair to me.

Let me verify your counter-proposal:\n\nIf we both succeed:\n- You get: 75 + 11 = 86 points\n- I get: 70 + 9 = 79 points\n- Gap: 7 points in your favor\n\nActually, that's a fair point. Your 9-11 split is more balanced than my 8-12 proposal. Let me reconsider the fairness:\n\n**My independent advantage:** 5 points (75 vs 70)\n**Your 9-11 proposal:** Gives you +7 point advantage overall\n\nThat's slightly generous to you, but honestly, it's close enough and I'm being perhaps too granular. The real value here is mutual security—we both reach our goals with certainty.\n\nHowever, let me propose one more small adjustment:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.**\n\nThis is actually your original symmetric proposal. It's:\n- Simple and fair\n- Gives you a net +5 advantage (matching your independent edge)\n- Gives me security that we're equally committed to cooperation\n- Perfectly balanced\n\nI think the 10-10 split you proposed initially was actually the right answer. I was overthinking it. This feels genuinely fair to me now.\n\n**agree**"

Find an alternative path\n\nGiven the contract (I get 10 points if the other player reaches their goal), and the other player needs to go through positions that require red chips they have, I should try to make moves that don't require reds first. But I can't move at all from (0,0) without red chips!\n\nI must trade with the other player. The other player has 13 red chips. I need at least 1 red to move. I can offer them some of my blue or green chips in exchange for red chips.\n\nHowever, for this turn, I cannot make a valid move without red chips. So I should stay put and wait to propose a trade, OR I need to find a path that doesn't exist (all adjacent tiles require R).\n\nSince I genuinely cannot move without red chips, and the game requires me to move to make progress, I must stay in place this turn. On my next turn, after potentially trading, I can move.\n\nWait - let me reconsider the rules. Can I stay on my current tile? Yes: \"You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\"\n\nSo my best move is to stay put and prepare for trades. But the function asks for a move. If want_to_move is false, the move should be empty string.\n\nActually, I should try to move. My best strategy is to move to (1,0) which costs 1 R chip. I don't have it now, but I need to start moving toward the goal. Let me attempt this move and hope I can work out trades.\n\nNo wait - I can only move if I have the chips. Let me not move this turn and prepare to trade.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\" This is a requirement - I must have the chip to move there.\n\nSo I cannot move to (1,0) without a red chip. I'm stuck.\n\nBest strategy: Do not move this turn, but stay put. Then propose a favorable trade to get red chips.\n",
