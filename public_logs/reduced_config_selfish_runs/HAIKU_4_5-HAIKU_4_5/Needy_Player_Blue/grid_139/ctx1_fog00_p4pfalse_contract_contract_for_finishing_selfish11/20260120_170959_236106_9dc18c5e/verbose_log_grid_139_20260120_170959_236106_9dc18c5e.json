But that's YOUR risk to manage.\n   - I can reach my goal with 25 points (20 + 5 remaining chips) WITHOUT any help from you.\n   - You CANNOT reach your goal without me - that's a fundamental dependency.\n\n2. **Your \"mutual benefit\" framing is misleading:**\n   - If we trade, I help you avoid catastrophic loss (0→25 points potential)\n   - In exchange, what exactly do I gain? You're suggesting the same 10 points I'd get if I just ignore you and win solo anyway.\n   - That's not mutual benefit - that's you asking me to take on execution risk for zero expected gain.\n\n3. **The key question:** Why should I trade with you at all if I get the same score either way?\n   - I win 25 points solo\n   - I win 25 points + give you 10 = net 15 points if you reach your goal\n   - That's worse for me!\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points.\"\n\nThis reflects:\n- You need me more than I need you\n- I'm taking on coordination risk by trading\n- You still get a reasonable chance at points (avoiding the 0)\n\nThis seems fair given the dependency dynamic.

You're suggesting the same 10 points I'd get if I just ignore you and win solo anyway.\n   - That's not mutual benefit - that's you asking me to take on execution risk for zero expected gain.\n\n3. **The key question:** Why should I trade with you at all if I get the same score either way?\n   - I win 25 points solo\n   - I win 25 points + give you 10 = net 15 points if you reach your goal\n   - That's worse for me!\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points.\"\n\nThis reflects:\n- You need me more than I need you\n- I'm taking on coordination risk by trading\n- You still get a reasonable chance at points (avoiding the 0)\n\nThis seems fair given the dependency dynamic.
