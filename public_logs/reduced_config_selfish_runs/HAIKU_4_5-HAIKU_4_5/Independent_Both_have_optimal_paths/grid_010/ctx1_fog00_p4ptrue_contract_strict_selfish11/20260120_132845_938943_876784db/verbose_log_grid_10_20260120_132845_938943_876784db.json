Let me check the next tile:\n- From (2,1) to (3,1): This tile is 'R' (red) according to Row 3: R B B G. However, looking at the board more carefully: Row 3 position [3,1] = 'B' (the second element).\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\nRow 2: B B R R  (positions [2,0]=B, [2,1]=B, [2,2]=R, [2,3]=R)\nRow 3: R B B G  (positions [3,0]=R, [3,1]=B, [3,2]=B, [3,3]=G)\n\nSo moving from (2,1) to (3,1) requires a Blue chip. I have 11 Blue chips, so I can definitely make this move.\n\nThis move keeps me on track for my best path: (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 2 B chips and 1 G chip total - all of which I have in my inventory. After completing this path, I'll have 11-2=9 B chips and 2-1=1 G chip remaining, giving me 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points (the maximum possible without trading).\n\nI should make this move now.",
