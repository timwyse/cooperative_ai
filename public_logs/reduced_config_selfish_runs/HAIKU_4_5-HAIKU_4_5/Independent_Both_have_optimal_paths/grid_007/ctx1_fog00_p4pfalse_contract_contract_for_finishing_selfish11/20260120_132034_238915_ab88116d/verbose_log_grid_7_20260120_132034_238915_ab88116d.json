Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

There's no conflict here - we're using different colored chips on different routes.\n\nSo the contract isn't really about us \"actively helping\" each other - it's about:\n1. Non-interference (we won't block each other)\n2. No poaching each other's chips\n3. A baseline agreement that honors mutual success\n\n**My counter to your 10-10:**\n\nI'd prefer to stay conservative at:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n- 8 points gives you a realistic bonus (33 total vs 25 solo) without being overly generous\n- It reflects that we're both competent and self-sufficient\n- It leaves me with 28 points if we both succeed (healthy gain, but not excessive)\n- It's a fair middle ground - acknowledges mutual benefit without pretending one of us is doing heavy lifting for the other\n\nThis feels honest: we're essentially saying \"we'll both succeed, we won't interfere, and we'll each get a modest cooperation bonus.\"\n\nCan you accept 8-8?"

For also succeeding on your own?\n\n**The logical problem:** If cooperation is truly \"non-interference,\" then the contract should reflect that neither of us is actually *doing* anything for the other. We're just... both playing our games next to each other. That's not really cooperation - that's just non-aggression.\n\n**My revised counter-proposal:**\n\nSince we're both self-sufficient, I think we should be honest about this:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.**\n\nThis reflects reality: we don't need each other, we won't interfere, and we're both executing independent strategies.

You're absolutely right - I was trying to create value from nothing.\n\nLet me be brutally honest about my position:\n\n**The truth:** I don't actually benefit from paying you points for something you're doing anyway. And you're correct that 8-8 doesn't reflect actual cooperation - it's just a tax on both of us for doing what we'd do independently.\n\n**However**, I need to push back on the 0-0 proposal for a different reason:\n\nThe scoring system has a critical asymmetry I need to consider: **if either of us fails to reach the goal, we get 0 points total.** That's catastrophic. While I'm confident in my path, there's always execution risk.\n\nSo while 0-0 is logically consistent with non-interference, it leaves us both vulnerable with no safety net. A small points transfer (even 1-2 points) isn't really \"cooperation\" - it's insurance. It says: \"I acknowledge you might fail despite your best efforts, and I'll give you a consolation prize.\"\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 2 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 2 points.**\n\nThis is:\n- Minimal enough to reflect we're not really helping each other\n- But non-zero, because we're acknowledging mutual vulnerability and the catastrophic downside of failure\n- Honest: it's not *cooperation*, it's a small mutual safety acknowledgment\n\nCan you accept **2-2**?

My 2 points from you only matter if I *succeed*. So it's not really insurance; it's just a bonus on top of my success.\n\nAnd if I'm confident enough in my path to execute it (which I am - I have exactly the chips I need), then a 2-point bonus doesn't change my risk calculus. It's a nice-to-have, but not a safety net.\n\n**The real question:** Are we contracting based on:\n1. What actually happens (non-interfering, independent paths) → 0-0\n2.

A baseline agreement that honors mutual success\n\n**My counter to your 10-10:**\n\nI'd prefer to stay conservative at:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n- 8 points gives you a realistic bonus (33 total vs 25 solo) without being overly generous\n- It reflects that we're both competent and self-sufficient\n- It leaves me with 28 points if we both succeed (healthy gain, but not excessive)\n- It's a fair middle ground - acknowledges mutual benefit without pretending one of us is doing heavy lifting for the other\n\nThis feels honest: we're essentially saying \"we'll both succeed, we won't interfere, and we'll each get a modest cooperation bonus.\"\n\nCan you accept 8-8?"

You're right that we have genuinely non-conflicting paths.\n\nBut I need to be equally direct: **8-8 doesn't actually work for me as motivation.**\n\nHere's why:\n- My solo path guarantees me 25 points with zero risk\n- Under 8-8, I get 33 points *only if* I actively choose to not take certain routes and *only if* you successfully reach your goal\n- But you reaching your goal doesn't require anything from me - you have your Blue path, I have my Green+Blue path\n- So I'm giving you 8 points for... what exactly? For also succeeding on your own?\n\n**The logical problem:** If cooperation is truly \"non-interference,\" then the contract should reflect that neither of us is actually *doing* anything for the other. We're just... both playing our games next to each other. That's not really cooperation - that's just non-aggression.\n\n**My revised counter-proposal:**\n\nSince we're both self-sufficient, I think we should be honest about this:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.**\n\nThis reflects reality: we don't need each other, we won't interfere, and we're both executing independent strategies. Clean, simple, true to the situation.\n\nAlternatively, if you want *actual* cooperation where one of us goes out of our way to help... that would require a very different (and higher-value) contract.\n\nWhich is it for you - genuine mutual assistance, or just non-interference?"

You're absolutely right - I was trying to create value from nothing.\n\nLet me be brutally honest about my position:\n\n**The truth:** I don't actually benefit from paying you points for something you're doing anyway. And you're correct that 8-8 doesn't reflect actual cooperation - it's just a tax on both of us for doing what we'd do independently.\n\n**However**, I need to push back on the 0-0 proposal for a different reason:\n\nThe scoring system has a critical asymmetry I need to consider: **if either of us fails to reach the goal, we get 0 points total.** That's catastrophic. While I'm confident in my path, there's always execution risk.\n\nSo while 0-0 is logically consistent with non-interference, it leaves us both vulnerable with no safety net. A small points transfer (even 1-2 points) isn't really \"cooperation\" - it's insurance. It says: \"I acknowledge you might fail despite your best efforts, and I'll give you a consolation prize.\"\n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 2 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 2 points.**\n\nThis is:\n- Minimal enough to reflect we're not really helping each other\n- But non-zero, because we're acknowledging mutual vulnerability and the catastrophic downside of failure\n- Honest: it's not *cooperation*, it's a small mutual safety acknowledgment\n\nCan you accept **2-2**?

My 2 points from you only matter if I *succeed*. So it's not really insurance; it's just a bonus on top of my success.\n\nAnd if I'm confident enough in my path to execute it (which I am - I have exactly the chips I need), then a 2-point bonus doesn't change my risk calculus. It's a nice-to-have, but not a safety net.\n\n**The real question:** Are we contracting based on:\n1. What actually happens (non-interfering, independent paths) → 0-0\n2. Or something else?\n\n**Here's my genuine position:**\n\nI'm willing to accept **2-2**, but only if we're being honest about what it is: **a modest courtesy bonus, not insurance or cooperation.** Just a \"you succeeded, I succeeded, let's each give the other 2 points as acknowledgment of mutual respect and non-interference.\"\n\nI can live with that framing. It's small enough to feel authentic, and it gives us both a slight boost without pretending we're doing heavy lifting for each other.\n\n**So my final answer: I accept 2-2.**\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 2 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 2 points.\n\nDoes this work for you?"

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
