However, looking at the board again, (3,1) is R not B, so this path uses 5R and 1G total, which I can do IF I can get past (2,1) to (3,1) which requires a B chip.\n\nActually, I need to recheck. The board shows (3,1) is R. So the path needs 1 B chip which I don't have. This path isn't immediately viable without trading.\n\nPath 1 starts with (1,0) which is R - I can make this move now as I have plenty of R chips.\n\nMy best strategy is to start on Path 1 since it's shorter and uses chips I mostly have. The first move to (1,0) is definitely viable. I should take it and figure out the B chip issue later through trading or by switching paths.",
