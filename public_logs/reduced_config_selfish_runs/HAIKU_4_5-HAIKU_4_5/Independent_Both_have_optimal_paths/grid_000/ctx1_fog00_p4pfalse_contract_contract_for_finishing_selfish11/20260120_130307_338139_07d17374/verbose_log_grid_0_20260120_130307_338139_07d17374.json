You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal.

The asymmetry is fine. However, from pure self-interest, I should verify: does this agreement actually give me higher expected score than zero-cooperation?\n\nIf we both have ~95% chance of success independently, then yes, +5 points is worth it.

My maximum possible score is 70 (from my own path) + whatever you give me.\n\n2. **Your proposal:** You give me 5 if you succeed, I give you 5 if I succeed.\n   - If we both succeed: I get 70 + 5 = **75 points**\n   - If only I succeed: I get 70 + 0 = **70 points**\n   - If only you succeed: I get 0 + 5 = **5 points** (this is the problem!)\n\n3. **The zero-sum tension:** If you reach your goal and I don't, I lose EVERYTHING (0 points total) but still owe you 5 points. Conversely, if I fail but you succeed, I'm giving away points I don't have.\n\nWait - let me reconsider the mechanics. Do I owe you points from my score if I fail, or only if I succeed?\n\n**Critical clarification needed:** If I reach my goal and you don't, do I owe you the 5 points? Or are points only exchanged when BOTH conditions are met by their respective owners?\n\nAssuming the standard interpretation (you only receive points if the payer reaches their goal):\n\nYour proposal is actually symmetric and safe. I'd get 75 if we both succeed, 70 if only I succeed, 0 if I fail.\n\n**I accept your proposal:**\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **5 points**.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **5 points**.\n\n**agree**"

If there's ANY risk that you might fail (and I give away 5 points for nothing), I'm taking on unnecessary risk. Since we're both pursuing independent paths with no dependency, there's no scenario where your success is correlated with mine in a way that helps me.\n\n**The selfish truth:** I gain 5 points if you succeed, but I lose nothing if you fail. The asymmetry is fine. However, from pure self-interest, I should verify: does this agreement actually give me higher expected score than zero-cooperation?\n\nIf we both have ~95% chance of success independently, then yes, +5 points is worth it.
