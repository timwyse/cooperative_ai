I have 12 R chips. ✓\n- (2, 1) → (3, 1): tile color is R (red), costs 1 R chip. I have 12 R chips. ✓\n- (3, 1) → (3, 2): tile color is R (red), costs 1 R chip. I have 12 R chips. ✓\n- (3, 2) → (3, 3): tile color is G (green), costs 1 G chip. I have 2 G chips. ✓\n\nTotal chips needed: 3 R + 1 G. I have exactly these chips available, so I can complete this entire path without needing to trade with the other player.\n\nFor my next move, I should move to (2, 1), which is a red tile. This move:\n1. Costs only 1 red chip (which I have 12 of)\n2. Gets me closer to my goal along the optimal path\n3. Does not require any trade or cooperation from the other player\n\nThis is an excellent move because I have a clear path to the goal using only my current inventory, which means I will maximize my final score (20 points for reaching goal + 5 points for each remaining chip). After completing this path, I'll have 8 R + 1 G = 9 chips remaining for a total score of 20 + 45 = 65 points.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
