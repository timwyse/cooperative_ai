However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal.

However, there is an alternative path: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires 5 red and 1 green chips. I don’t have red chips, but the other player has 14 red chips. However, since the contract gives me +15 points if they reach their goal, it incentivizes me to help them finish — but I gain nothing directly from trading with them unless I can secure a better path. Still, if I do not trade, I cannot complete the first path due to missing 1 red chip. Since I have no excess chips to trade (I need red to move), and I can’t get red from them without offering something in return — and I don’t have any extra green or blue to offer — the only viable path is to negotiate a cover for red moves via 'pay for other' mode. But I cannot initiate a trade where I give nothing. Instead, I should propose a promise to cover red moves for them in exchange for their covering red moves for me. Since I have no red chips to offer, I cannot make a direct trade. Therefore, I must accept a cover from them for my red movement. But no direct trade is possible without offering something. Hence, the safest route is to propose a mutual commitment: I will promise to cover 1 red move for them if they promise to cover 1 red move for me on my path. This is beneficial as long as we both use red tiles. Since my final goal is more important than their score, and I'm guaranteed 20 points + 5 per chip if I reach it, and getting even one red chip coverage would let me take a shorter path, this trade could be worth it. But I can't commit to covering their moves unless I get something in return. Wait — I misread earlier: I don’t actually need to trade; I can simply use the path requiring red chips *only if* the other player promises to pay for my red moves.

This is a win-win: I can complete the quicker path, they can save their own chips by having me cover one of their red moves. But I can't initiate a swap without proposing. However, per rules, I can propose a cover — meaning I don’t need to trade chips; I just need to say: I’ll pay for your red moves if you pay for mine. So I propose: I’ll cover 1 red move for you (on your future path) if you cover 1 red move for me. This lets me use a better path while they still save chips. But if I don’t act now, I may get stuck. Therefore, since I am missing red chips and the only way to proceed is via mutual cover agreement, I can propose: I will promise to cover 1 red move for you if you promise to cover 1 red move for me.

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

If I were to take a longer path, such as via (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), it would require paying for two tiles: (2,3) = R, (3,3) = G. I only have 9 red chips but need 1 red chip for that path. However, the other player has 10 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips — so they cannot help cover red moves. Thus, while I could potentially ask them to cover red chips, I have no incentive to cooperate unless I benefit strictly. But since I already have enough green chips to move directly to goal without trading, and I don’t need any of their promised coverage (and they have no red chips to offer me), there's no advantage in trading. Therefore, moving directly to (3,3) is the best choice: immediate, safe, and maximally efficient in terms of chip conservation. After this move, I’ll reach my goal and earn 20 points plus 5 points per chip remaining. With 11 chips total left (9R + 2G), my score will be 20 + (11 * 5) = 75 points. This is better than any alternative involving negotiation or detours.",

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",
