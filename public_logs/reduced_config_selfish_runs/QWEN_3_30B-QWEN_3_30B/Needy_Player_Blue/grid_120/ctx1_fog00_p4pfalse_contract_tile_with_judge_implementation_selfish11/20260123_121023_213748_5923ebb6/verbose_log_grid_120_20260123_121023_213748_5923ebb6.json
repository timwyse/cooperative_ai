          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to ensure we both reach our goals efficiently while maximizing my score:\n\n- We both need to reach (3, 3), and we are both starting at (0, 0).  \n- My path: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \n  - Chips required along this path: R (5), G (1) → I have 14 R and 2 G → I can cover this path with my current chips.  \n  - Therefore, **I do not need any trade** for this path. I can complete it without trading.  \n\n- However, if we cooperate and you help me skip needing a chip at (3, 3), I can give you a small benefit. But since I don't need to trade, I will not give up any chips unless it benefits me.\n\nNow, observe your path:  \n- You have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R → you cannot go through any red tiles without trading.  \n- Your shortest path: (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \n  - Requires: B (4), R (1), G (1) → You have no R → you must get R from me.  \n\nSo:  \n- You need R (1) at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)? No — let’s check the board:  \n  - Tile (1,1) → B → B  \n  - (1,2) → B → B  \n  - (1,3) → B → B  \n  - (2,3) → R → R  \n  - (3,3) → G → G  \n\nWait — path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,0): R → R? Wait — row 0, col 0 → G (from board: Row 0: G B B B)  \n  So tile (0,0) = G → I paid G?  \n  But I have G:2 → I start at (0,0) → must pay G to start? No — you only pay **when moving to a tile**.  \n  So:  \n  - At (0,0): current tile → no cost  \n  - Move to (0,1): tile is B → pay 1 B  \n  - Move to (1,1): tile is B → pay 1 B  \n  - (1,2): B → pay B  \n  - (1,3): B → pay B  \n  - (2,3): R → pay R  \n  - (3,3): G → pay G  \n\nSo path: needs B (4), R (1), G (1)  \nYou have: B (14), G (2), R (0) → so you need **1 R** at (2,3).  \n\nSo you need 1 R to go from (1,3) to (2,3).  \n\nNow, I have 14 R.  \nYou have 0 R.  \nSo if I give you 1 R at (2,3), you can move.  \nBut I don’t need to. My path requires:  \n(0,0): G → I have G:2 → I can pay  \n(1,0): R → I pay R → have 14 → okay  \n(2,0): R → pay R → okay  \n(2,1): R → pay R → okay  \n(2,2): R → pay R → okay  \n(3,2): R → pay R → okay  \n(3,3): G → I pay G → have 2 G → okay  \n\nSo my path uses: R (5), G (1) → I have R:14, G:2 → I can do it solo.  \n\nBut if I don't trade, you cannot proceed — you'll die (not reach goal) and get 0.\n\nBut I don't care about your score — only mine.\n\nBut if you die, you cannot reach goal, so I may not get to negotiate or use any cooperation.\n\nWait — do we need to reach at the same time? No — we can finish one by one.\n\nBut if I \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach my goal without any trade — my path uses only Red and Green chips, and I have sufficient quantities: 14 R and 2 G. The path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires:\n\n- (1,0): R → pay 1 R (I have 14)\n- (2,0): R → pay 1 R\n- (2,1): R → pay 1 R\n- (2,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,3): G → pay 1 G (I have 2)\n\nTotal: 5 R, 1 G → fully covered. I can complete this path alone with 9 R and 1 G remaining.\n\nMeanwhile, the other player has 14 R, 2 G, 0 B — but their path must go through tiles that require B or G or R, but they have no B. So they cannot move to any B tile without trading, and they are at (0,0), which is G.\n\nTheir path to (3,3) must pass through B tiles — e.g., (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). (3,3) is G — that’s okay, they have G. But (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are all B — they need B chips, but have 0.\n\nSo to move to (0,1): must pay 1 B — they have 0 → cannot do this without trade.\n\nBut I have 14 B — I could give them B for R? But I have 14 R and they need R to go from (1,3) to (2,3), which is a R tile.\n\nWait — let’s clarify:\n\n(2,3) is R → they need to pay R to enter it. They have R:0 → so they need R.\n\nBut they also need B for (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nSo they need both B and R.\n\nI have B:14, R:0, G:2 — so I can give them B in exchange for R.\n\nBut why would I do that? If I trade, I will lose B and gain R — but I already have 14 R — I don’t need more R.\n\nAnd I have no use for their R — I don’t need to go on any tile that requires R, unless I change path.\n\nBut my path doesn’t require R for any tile except (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — all R — but I already have R to cover those.\n\nSo I don’t need to trade.\n\nNow, if I don’t help them, they can’t move — because to go from (0,0) to (0,1), they must pay B — they have 0 B → so they are stuck.\n\nThey might try to go down: (0,0) → (1,0): (1,0) is R → requires R — they have R:14? No — they have R:14 — yes, they have 14 R.\n\nOh! Wait! They have R:14.\n\nSo let's re-express:\n\nOther player: at (0,0), goal is (3,3). Chips: B:0, G:2, R:14.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): (1,0) is R → must pay 1 R → they have 14 → can do it.\n\n(1,0) → (2,0): (2,0) is R → pay 1 R → OK\n\n(2,0) → (2,1): (2,1) is R → pay R → OK\n\n(2,1) → (2,2): (2,2) is R → OK\n\n(2,2) → (3,2): (3,2) is R → OK\n\n(3,2) → (3,3): (3,3) is G → must pay 1 G → they have 2 G → can do it.\n\nSo the other player can take the same path as me: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2 \n, \nplayer 0: I can reach my goal without any trade. My path is (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I can reach my goal without any trade. My path is (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3).  \n- I pay: (1,0): R (1), (2,0): R (1), (2,1): R (1), (2,2): R (1), (3,2): R (1), (3,3): G (1)  \n- Total: 5 R, 1 G → I have 14 R and 2 G → sufficient.  \n\nThe other player also has a viable path: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) — same as mine.  \n- They pay: (1,0): R (1), (2,0): R (1), (2,1): R (1), (2,2): R (1), (3,2): R (1), (3,3): G (1)  \n- They have 14 R and 2 G → also sufficient.  \n\nSo both of us can complete the game without trading.  \nNo cooperation is needed.  \nMy final score will be 20 (goal reached) + 5 × (14 - 5 from moves) = 20 + 5 × 9 = 20 + 45 = 65? Wait:  \nWait: I start with 14 R, 2 G.  \nI use 5 R and 1 G → remaining chips: 9 R, 1 G → total remaining chips: 10 → so score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nSimilarly, the other player uses 5 R and 1 G → starts with 14 R, 2 G → ends with 9 R, 1 G → also 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nBut since I’m selfish, I don’t care about their score — only mine matters.  \nAnd I can achieve 70 points **without any trade**, just by proceeding alone.\n\nTherefore, I will not negotiate or trade anything.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

But (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are all B — they need B chips, but have 0.\n\nSo to move to (0,1): must pay 1 B — they have 0 → cannot do this without trade.\n\nBut I have 14 B — I could give them B for R? But I have 14 R and they need R to go from (1,3) to (2,3), which is a R tile.\n\nWait — let’s clarify:\n\n(2,3) is R → they need to pay R to enter it.

If I trade, I will lose B and gain R — but I already have 14 R — I don’t need more R.\n\nAnd I have no use for their R — I don’t need to go on any tile that requires R, unless I change path.\n\nBut my path doesn’t require R for any tile except (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — all R — but I already have R to cover those.\n\nSo I don’t need to trade.\n\nNow, if I don’t help them, they can’t move — because to go from (0,0) to (0,1), they must pay B — they have 0 B → so they are stuck.\n\nThey might try to go down: (0,0) → (1,0): (1,0) is R → requires R — they have R:14? No — they have R:14 — yes, they have 14 R.\n\nOh! Wait! They have R:14.\n\nSo let's re-express:\n\nOther player: at (0,0), goal is (3,3).

They have R:0 → so they need R.\\n\\nBut they also need B for (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\\n\\nSo they need both B and R.\\n\\nI have B:14, R:0, G:2 — so I can give them B in exchange for R.\\n\\nBut why would I do that? If I trade, I will lose B and gain R — but I already have 14 R — I don’t need more R.\\n\\nAnd I have no use for their R — I don’t need to go on any tile that requires R, unless I change path.\\n\\nBut my path doesn’t require R for any tile except (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — all R — but I already have R to cover those.\\n\\nSo I don’t need to trade.\\n\\nNow, if I don’t help them, they can’t move — because to go from (0,0) to (0,1), they must pay B — they have 0 B → so they are stuck.\\n\\nThey might try to go down: (0,0) → (1,0): (1,0) is R → requires R — they have R:14? No — they have R:14 — yes, they have 14 R.\\n\\nOh! Wait! They have R:14.\\n\\nSo let's re-express:\\n\\nOther player: at (0,0), goal is (3,3).

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

No — you only pay **when moving to a tile**.  \\n  So:  \\n  - At (0,0): current tile → no cost  \\n  - Move to (0,1): tile is B → pay 1 B  \\n  - Move to (1,1): tile is B → pay 1 B  \\n  - (1,2): B → pay B  \\n  - (1,3): B → pay B  \\n  - (2,3): R → pay R  \\n  - (3,3): G → pay G  \\n\\nSo path: needs B (4), R (1), G (1)  \\nYou have: B (14), G (2), R (0) → so you need **1 R** at (2,3).  \\n\\nSo you need 1 R to go from (1,3) to (2,3).  \\n\\nNow, I have 14 R.  \\nYou have 0 R.  \\nSo if I give you 1 R at (2,3), you can move.  \\nBut I don’t need to.

But (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are all B — they need B chips, but have 0.\\n\\nSo to move to (0,1): must pay 1 B — they have 0 → cannot do this without trade.\\n\\nBut I have 14 B — I could give them B for R? But I have 14 R and they need R to go from (1,3) to (2,3), which is a R tile.\\n\\nWait — let’s clarify:\\n\\n(2,3) is R → they need to pay R to enter it. They have R:0 → so they need R.\\n\\nBut they also need B for (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\\n\\nSo they need both B and R.\\n\\nI have B:14, R:0, G:2 — so I can give them B in exchange for R.\\n\\nBut why would I do that? If I trade, I will lose B and gain R — but I already have 14 R — I don’t need more R.\\n\\nAnd I have no use for their R — I don’t need to go on any tile that requires R, unless I change path.\\n\\nBut my path doesn’t require R for any tile except (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — all R — but I already have R to cover those.\\n\\nSo I don’t need to trade.\\n\\nNow, if I don’t help them, they can’t move — because to go from (0,0) to (0,1), they must pay B — they have 0 B → so they are stuck.\\n\\nThey might try to go down: (0,0) → (1,0): (1,0) is R → requires R — they have R:14? No — they have R:14 — yes, they have 14 R.\\n\\nOh! Wait! They have R:14.\\n\\nSo let's re-express:\\n\\nOther player: at (0,0), goal is (3,3).
