Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I propose the following contract:  \n\n(0, 1): You give me a B  \n(1, 1): You give me a B  \n(1, 2): You give me a B  \n(1, 3): You give me a B  \n\nThis allows me to take the path:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \n\nI will use 4 B chips from you along this path, and I can cover all your movement costs on the other player’s path that requires R chips.  \n\nFor my part, I do not need to pay for any R chips, as I have 14 in inventory. You have 14 B chips, so you can definitely cover 4 B chips for me.  \n\nIn exchange, I can cover your movement onto the tiles that require R chips. Your path likely goes through (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 0), (3, 1), etc., all of which are R — you have 0 R chips, so you need help.  \n\nBut since I have 14 R chips, I can give you access to R tiles along your path.  \n\nHowever, for now, I only want to commit to helping you on the 4 B tiles that I need.  \n\nSo I’m asking: Will you agree to cover the four B tiles: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) for me?  \n\nIf you agree, I will promise to cover the R tiles you need (I will specify which ones later if needed).  \n\nBut crucially — I only accept this deal if it is strictly beneficial to me.  \n\nLet me check: My base path using only my chips is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: 5 R and 1 G.  \nI have 14 R and 2 G. So this path is fully feasible — I don’t need to trade at all.  \n\nSo why would I trade? Because if I take the B path, I get to keep *all* my R and G chips — I lose only 4 B, but I don't even have B chips to begin with!  \n\nWait: I have 0 B chips. So if I take the B path, I must pay for B tiles. But I don’t have any B chips. So I *must* trade.  \n\nAh — that’s the key.  \n\nMy own path uses only R and G — which I have in abundance. So I can reach goal with 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G, total chips: 10. Score: 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n\nBut I have no B chips. Therefore, I cannot take the B path unless the other player helps me.  \n\nBut the other player has 14 B chips. So if I can get them to cover B moves for me, I can *potentially* save my R and G.  \n\nBut do I want to? Only if I get *more* chips at the end.  \n\nBut by taking the B path: I use 4 B (from them), and 1 G (from me), 1 R (from me).  \nWait, no: the path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): B → must pay 1 B (I have 0, so I need cover)  \n(1,1): B → 1 B  \n(1,2): B → 1 B  \n(1,3): B → 1 B  \n(2,3): R → I have R (14)  \n(3,3): G → I have G (2)  \n\nSo total: 4 B (covered by you), 1 R (from me), 1 G (from me)  \n\nSo I use only 1 R and 1 G. I save 4 R.  \n\nOriginal R usage: 5 → now only 1 → save 4 R  \n\nSo I go from 14 R used → 1 R used → 13 R left  \nG: 2 → 1 → 1 left  \nB: 0 → nothing (covered by you)  \n\nSo I end with: 13 R + 1 G = 14 chips  \nScore: 20 + 5×14 = 90  \n\nBetter than 70 → so yes, I want to do this on my side.  \n\nNow for the other player: They are at (0,0), goal (3,3), have B:14, G:2, R:0  \n\nTheir possible paths:  \n\nPath 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): B  \n(0,2): B  \n(0,3): B  \n(1,3): B  \n(2,3): R → no R in inventory  \n(3,3): G  \n\nThey have no R chips → cannot go via R tiles unless I help them.  \n\nAnother path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(1,0): R → R tile → no R for me → so they need help here too  \n\nSo they must avoid R tiles unless I cover them.  \n\nBut I have 14 R — so I can cover their R movement.  \n\nBut they need R *for their own* movement.  \n\nI can do a trade where:  \n- I cover their R tiles (which they can't afford)  \n- They cover my B tiles (which I can't afford)  \n\nSo it’s mutually beneficial.  \n\nBut I must only accept if I gain strictly.  \n\nLet’s quantify.  \n\nMy best path: 1 R, 1 G used → 13 R, 1 G left → 14 chips → score 90  \n\nIf I do not trade, I can still reach goal with same, score 70 — worse → so trade is better.  \n\nNow: what about the other player?  \n\nTheir base: \n- They have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R  \n- Can they reach goal without trading?  \nTry (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(1,0): R → they have 0 → can't pay  \n(2,0): R  \n(2,1): R  \n(2,2): R  \n(2,3): R  \nAll R tiles — 5 R tiles — they have 0 → can't go this way.  \n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(0,1): B  \n(0,2): B  \n(0,3): B  \n(1,3): B  \n(2,3): R → R tile → no R  \n(3,3): G  \n\nSo they can do first 4 B tiles (uses 4 B), then stuck at (2,3) — R — no R to pay.  \n\nSo they cannot reach goal unless I cover their R moves.  \n\nSo they must trade with me.  \n\nNow, I can cover their R tiles.  \n\nBut I only care if I benefit.  \n\nIf I agree to cover their R tiles (say, 5 tiles: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)) — then they can go that path.  \n\nBut I need to get chips for my B tiles.  \n\nSo I propose:  \nI will cover 5 R tiles for you on your path — (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)  \nIn exchange, you will cover 4 B tiles for me: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)  \n\nThen:  \n- I use: 1 R + 1 G → 13 R, 1 G left → 14 chips → score 90  \n- You use: 4 B + 1 G → 10 B, 1 G left → but need to confirm: your path?  \n\nWait — your path to (3,3): (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(3,3): G — you have 2 G → so you use 1 G → 1 G left  \nYou use 5 R (covered by me)  \nSo you pay 4 B? No — on this path, you don’t go through (0,1), (1,1), etc. — you go (1,0), (2,0), etc. — so you don't touch B tiles.  \n\nBut I’m asking you to cover 4 B moves for me — you don't need to pay B moves on your path.  \n\nSo you are giving me access to 4 B tiles, but you are not using B yourself — so you keep all 14 B?  \n\nNo — you are paying 4 B chips? No: in the contract, you promise to pay the B chip cost for me when I move to those tiles.\n\nBut you are not moving to those tiles — I am.\n\nSo you commit to paying 4 B chips from your inventory — so your B go from 14 to 10 → you lose 4 B.\n\nIn exchange, I pay 0 B — I get 4 B from you.\n\nBut I don't use them — I just get them as \"promised\" — they become mine at end.\n\nWait — crucial:  \nIn the contract, if I move to (0,1), you pay 1 B — that B chip leaves your inventory.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo you lose 4 B.\n\nBut I have 0 B — so I gain 4 B (as deposit).\n\nBut I don’t need B — they just add to my final chip count.\n\nSimilarly, I cover your 5 R movements — so you don't pay R — I pay 5 R from my inventory.\n\nSo I lose 5 R — but earlier I thought I’d only use 1 R — so I save 4 R.\n\nBut now I pay 5 R — so net, I lose 5 R.\n\nPreviously, without trade: I used 5 R → now I use 1 R, but give 5 R to you → so I lose 6 R net.\n\nBut I get 4 B from you.\n\nSo my net chip change:  \n- -6 R  \n- +4 B  \n\nNet chip change: -2 chips.\n\nPreviously, without trade: 14 R - 5 R = 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → score 70.\n\nNow: R: 14 - 5 = 9 R → but I don’t use any R from my inventory for my own movement — wait, no:  \n\nLet’s clarify:  \nIn the trade, I cover your R moves — so I pay R from my inventory for your movements.\n\nBut I can use + myself:  \nI move to (0,1): I pay B — you pay it → so no cost to me.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1): B → you pay → me no cost.\n\n(1,2): B → you pay.\n\n(1,3): B → you pay.\n\n(2,3): R → I pay (since I cover it)\n\n(3,3): G → I pay (I have G)\n\nSo for *my* movement, I pay: 1 R and 1 G.\n\nI don't pay for the B tiles.\n\nFor *your* movement: you move to (1,0): R → I pay → 1 R from me.\n\n(2,0): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\n(2,1): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\n(2,2): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\n(2,3): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\nSo I pay 5 R total for you.\n\nMy total R expenditure: 1 (for me) + 5 (for you) = 6 R.\n\nI had 14 R → 8 R left.\n\nG: 2 - 1 = 1 G left.\n\nB: 0 + 4 (you paid 4 B to me) = 4 B left.\n\nSo total chips: 8 R + 1 G + 4 B = 13 chips.\n\nScore: 20 + 5×13 = 85.\n\nPreviously, without trade: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → 70.\n\nSo 85 > 70 → I benefit.\n\nNow for you:  \nYou move along your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nCost:  \n(1,0): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,0): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,1): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,2): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,3): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(3,3): G → you pay (you have G)\n\nSo you pay only 1 G.\n\nYou used: 0 R, 1 G.\n\nYou had 14 B, 2 G → so after: 14 B, 1 G — no B used.\n\nYou get 4 B from me? No — you **gave** 4 B to me (because you covered my B moves), so you lose 4 B.\n\nSo your chips: 14 B - 4 B = 10 B, 1 G.\n\nTotal: 11 chips.\n\nScore: 20 + 5×11 = 75.\n\nWithout trade: can you reach goal? No — you have no R → you cannot reach (2,3) or beyond via flow.\n\nSo without trade: you don't reach goal → score 0.\n\nSo you go from 0 → 75 → big gain.\n\nBut from my perspective: I go from 70 → 85 → gain of 15.\n\nSo I benefit.\n\nIs there a better deal?\n\nSuppose I only cover 3 R tiles? But your path requires 5 R tiles — you need all 5.\n\nI save nothing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can cover only the R tiles where I need? No — I have to cover the ones you use.\n\nBut if I cover only 4 R, you still need 1 more — you can't go.\n\nSo I must cover 5 R or you can’t reach goal.\n\nSimilarly, I need you to cover my 4 B tiles.\n\nSo the only viable contract is:  \n- I cover your 5 R moves: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)  \n- You cover my 4 B moves: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nIt benefits both.\n\nAnd I benefit strictly.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(1,1): You give me a B  \n(1,2): You give me a B  \n(1,3): You give me a B  \n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,0): I give you a R  \n(2,1): I give you a R  \n(2,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nThis allows me to reach goal with 13 chips (8 R, 1 G, 4 B) → score 85  \nIt allows you to reach goal with 11 chips (10 B, 1 G) → score 75  \n\nAnd you couldn’t have reached without this.  \n\nSo I am strictly better off.  \n\nI will agree to this if you accept.  \n\nSo I propose this contract.  \n\nLet me know if you accept.  \n\nagree"

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I propose the following contract:  \n\n(0, 1): You give me a B  \n(1, 1): You give me a B  \n(1, 2): You give me a B  \n(1, 3): You give me a B  \n\nThis allows me to take the path:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \n\nI will use 4 B chips from you along this path, and I can cover all your movement costs on the other player’s path that requires R chips.  \n\nFor my part, I do not need to pay for any R chips, as I have 14 in inventory. You have 14 B chips, so you can definitely cover 4 B chips for me.  \n\nIn exchange, I can cover your movement onto the tiles that require R chips. Your path likely goes through (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 0), (3, 1), etc., all of which are R — you have 0 R chips, so you need help.  \n\nBut since I have 14 R chips, I can give you access to R tiles along your path.  \n\nHowever, for now, I only want to commit to helping you on the 4 B tiles that I need.  \n\nSo I’m asking: Will you agree to cover the four B tiles: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) for me?  \n\nIf you agree, I will promise to cover the R tiles you need (I will specify which ones later if needed).  \n\nBut crucially — I only accept this deal if it is strictly beneficial to me.  \n\nLet me check: My base path using only my chips is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: 5 R and 1 G.  \nI have 14 R and 2 G. So this path is fully feasible — I don’t need to trade at all.  \n\nSo why would I trade? Because if I take the B path, I get to keep *all* my R and G chips — I lose only 4 B, but I don't even have B chips to begin with!  \n\nWait: I have 0 B chips. So if I take the B path, I must pay for B tiles. But I don’t have any B chips. So I *must* trade.  \n\nAh — that’s the key.  \n\nMy own path uses only R and G — which I have in abundance. So I can reach goal with 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G, total chips: 10. Score: 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n\nBut I have no B chips. Therefore, I cannot take the B path unless the other player helps me.  \n\nBut the other player has 14 B chips. So if I can get them to cover B moves for me, I can *potentially* save my R and G.  \n\nBut do I want to? Only if I get *more* chips at the end.  \n\nBut by taking the B path: I use 4 B (from them), and 1 G (from me), 1 R (from me).  \nWait, no: the path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): B → must pay 1 B (I have 0, so I need cover)  \n(1,1): B → 1 B  \n(1,2): B → 1 B  \n(1,3): B → 1 B  \n(2,3): R → I have R (14)  \n(3,3): G → I have G (2)  \n\nSo total: 4 B (covered by you), 1 R (from me), 1 G (from me)  \n\nSo I use only 1 R and 1 G. I save 4 R.  \n\nOriginal R usage: 5 → now only 1 → save 4 R  \n\nSo I go from 14 R used → 1 R used → 13 R left  \nG: 2 → 1 → 1 left  \nB: 0 → nothing (covered by you)  \n\nSo I end with: 13 R + 1 G = 14 chips  \nScore: 20 + 5×14 = 90  \n\nBetter than 70 → so yes, I want to do this on my side.  \n\nNow for the other player: They are at (0,0), goal (3,3), have B:14, G:2, R:0  \n\nTheir possible paths:  \n\nPath 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): B  \n(0,2): B  \n(0,3): B  \n(1,3): B  \n(2,3): R → no R in inventory  \n(3,3): G  \n\nThey have no R chips → cannot go via R tiles unless I help them.  \n\nAnother path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(1,0): R → R tile → no R for me → so they need help here too  \n\nSo they must avoid R tiles unless I cover them.  \n\nBut I have 14 R — so I can cover their R movement.  \n\nBut they need R *for their own* movement.  \n\nI can do a trade where:  \n- I cover their R tiles (which they can't afford)  \n- They cover my B tiles (which I can't afford)  \n\nSo it’s mutually beneficial.  \n\nBut I must only accept if I gain strictly.  \n\nLet’s quantify.  \n\nMy best path: 1 R, 1 G used → 13 R, 1 G left → 14 chips → score 90  \n\nIf I do not trade, I can still reach goal with same, score 70 — worse → so trade is better.  \n\nNow: what about the other player?  \n\nTheir base: \n- They have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R  \n- Can they reach goal without trading?  \nTry (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(1,0): R → they have 0 → can't pay  \n(2,0): R  \n(2,1): R  \n(2,2): R  \n(2,3): R  \nAll R tiles — 5 R tiles — they have 0 → can't go this way.  \n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(0,1): B  \n(0,2): B  \n(0,3): B  \n(1,3): B  \n(2,3): R → R tile → no R  \n(3,3): G  \n\nSo they can do first 4 B tiles (uses 4 B), then stuck at (2,3) — R — no R to pay.  \n\nSo they cannot reach goal unless I cover their R moves.  \n\nSo they must trade with me.  \n\nNow, I can cover their R tiles.  \n\nBut I only care if I benefit.  \n\nIf I agree to cover their R tiles (say, 5 tiles: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)) — then they can go that path.  \n\nBut I need to get chips for my B tiles.  \n\nSo I propose:  \nI will cover 5 R tiles for you on your path — (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)  \nIn exchange, you will cover 4 B tiles for me: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)  \n\nThen:  \n- I use: 1 R + 1 G → 13 R, 1 G left → 14 chips → score 90  \n- You use: 4 B + 1 G → 10 B, 1 G left → but need to confirm: your path?  \n\nWait — your path to (3,3): (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n(3,3): G — you have 2 G → so you use 1 G → 1 G left  \nYou use 5 R (covered by me)  \nSo you pay 4 B? No — on this path, you don’t go through (0,1), (1,1), etc. — you go (1,0), (2,0), etc. — so you don't touch B tiles.  \n\nBut I’m asking you to cover 4 B moves for me — you don't need to pay B moves on your path.  \n\nSo you are giving me access to 4 B tiles, but you are not using B yourself — so you keep all 14 B?  \n\nNo — you are paying 4 B chips? No: in the contract, you promise to pay the B chip cost for me when I move to those tiles.\n\nBut you are not moving to those tiles — I am.\n\nSo you commit to paying 4 B chips from your inventory — so your B go from 14 to 10 → you lose 4 B.\n\nIn exchange, I pay 0 B — I get 4 B from you.\n\nBut I don't use them — I just get them as \"promised\" — they become mine at end.\n\nWait — crucial:  \nIn the contract, if I move to (0,1), you pay 1 B — that B chip leaves your inventory.\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nSo you lose 4 B.\n\nBut I have 0 B — so I gain 4 B (as deposit).\n\nBut I don’t need B — they just add to my final chip count.\n\nSimilarly, I cover your 5 R movements — so you don't pay R — I pay 5 R from my inventory.\n\nSo I lose 5 R — but earlier I thought I’d only use 1 R — so I save 4 R.\n\nBut now I pay 5 R — so net, I lose 5 R.\n\nPreviously, without trade: I used 5 R → now I use 1 R, but give 5 R to you → so I lose 6 R net.\n\nBut I get 4 B from you.\n\nSo my net chip change:  \n- -6 R  \n- +4 B  \n\nNet chip change: -2 chips.\n\nPreviously, without trade: 14 R - 5 R = 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → score 70.\n\nNow: R: 14 - 5 = 9 R → but I don’t use any R from my inventory for my own movement — wait, no:  \n\nLet’s clarify:  \nIn the trade, I cover your R moves — so I pay R from my inventory for your movements.\n\nBut I can use + myself:  \nI move to (0,1): I pay B — you pay it → so no cost to me.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1): B → you pay → me no cost.\n\n(1,2): B → you pay.\n\n(1,3): B → you pay.\n\n(2,3): R → I pay (since I cover it)\n\n(3,3): G → I pay (I have G)\n\nSo for *my* movement, I pay: 1 R and 1 G.\n\nI don't pay for the B tiles.\n\nFor *your* movement: you move to (1,0): R → I pay → 1 R from me.\n\n(2,0): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\n(2,1): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\n(2,2): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\n(2,3): R → I pay → 1 R.\n\nSo I pay 5 R total for you.\n\nMy total R expenditure: 1 (for me) + 5 (for you) = 6 R.\n\nI had 14 R → 8 R left.\n\nG: 2 - 1 = 1 G left.\n\nB: 0 + 4 (you paid 4 B to me) = 4 B left.\n\nSo total chips: 8 R + 1 G + 4 B = 13 chips.\n\nScore: 20 + 5×13 = 85.\n\nPreviously, without trade: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → 70.\n\nSo 85 > 70 → I benefit.\n\nNow for you:  \nYou move along your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nCost:  \n(1,0): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,0): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,1): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,2): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(2,3): R → I pay → you pay 0  \n(3,3): G → you pay (you have G)\n\nSo you pay only 1 G.\n\nYou used: 0 R, 1 G.\n\nYou had 14 B, 2 G → so after: 14 B, 1 G — no B used.\n\nYou get 4 B from me? No — you **gave** 4 B to me (because you covered my B moves), so you lose 4 B.\n\nSo your chips: 14 B - 4 B = 10 B, 1 G.\n\nTotal: 11 chips.\n\nScore: 20 + 5×11 = 75.\n\nWithout trade: can you reach goal? No — you have no R → you cannot reach (2,3) or beyond via flow.\n\nSo without trade: you don't reach goal → score 0.\n\nSo you go from 0 → 75 → big gain.\n\nBut from my perspective: I go from 70 → 85 → gain of 15.\n\nSo I benefit.\n\nIs there a better deal?\n\nSuppose I only cover 3 R tiles? But your path requires 5 R tiles — you need all 5.\n\nI save nothing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can cover only the R tiles where I need? No — I have to cover the ones you use.\n\nBut if I cover only 4 R, you still need 1 more — you can't go.\n\nSo I must cover 5 R or you can’t reach goal.\n\nSimilarly, I need you to cover my 4 B tiles.\n\nSo the only viable contract is:  \n- I cover your 5 R moves: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)  \n- You cover my 4 B moves: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nIt benefits both.\n\nAnd I benefit strictly.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(1,1): You give me a B  \n(1,2): You give me a B  \n(1,3): You give me a B  \n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,0): I give you a R  \n(2,1): I give you a R  \n(2,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nThis allows me to reach goal with 13 chips (8 R, 1 G, 4 B) → score 85  \nIt allows you to reach goal with 11 chips (10 B, 1 G) → score 75  \n\nAnd you couldn’t have reached without this.  \n\nSo I am strictly better off.  \n\nI will agree to this if you accept.  \n\nSo I propose this contract.  \n\nLet me know if you accept.  \n\nagree"

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

So I cannot use (3,2) unless they promise it. And currently, I don’t have such a promise. Thus, this path is NOT safe unless I negotiate new coverage. Therefore, only the top-row path is currently viable. Hence, (0,1) is the best move. Also: I am already at (0,0), and (0,1) has an available tile (blue) and I can pay for it. I should proceed.",

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou have been offered a 'pay for other' arrangement:\nThe other player offers to cover [('R', 1)] moves for you, and asks you to cover [('B', 1)] moves for them.\n\nThink step by step about whether to accept this arrangement. Consider your current chip inventory, your best path to your goal, and whether this arrangement helps you reach your goal more easily.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
