Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I should demand *something*.  \n\nAlternative: I need help from them only if I *don’t* complete alone — but I **can** complete alone. So I don’t need them.  \n\nWait — if I don’t trade, I get: 20 + 5*5 = 20 + 25 = **45 points** (5 red chips left after using 5, plus 2 green used → total chips left: 14-5=9R, 2-1=1G → 10 chips → 50 points total? Wait — no: scoring is 20 for goal + 5 per chip → 20 + 5*10 = 70? Wait — let's recalculate.\n\nWait — I have 14 red and 2 green = total 16 chips.  \nPath uses: 5 red, 1 green → so 9 red + 1 green = 10 chips left.  \nSo score: 20 + 5*10 = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nIf I don’t go this path, but instead take the shorter one with more blue chips, I would need blue — I have no blue, so I can’t take that without trade. But I can go the red/green path fine alone.\n\nNow consider: if I trade with them, I could potentially get a better outcome? For example, if they give me red chips in exchange for my green or blue? But I have no blue, and I have green which they need.\n\nBut — I can *force* a trade by saying I’ll only help them if they give me at least 15 points.\n\nBut they don’t have red, so they can't pay me for red chips unless I give them green or blue. I have green — they have blue.\n\nThey have 14 blue and 2 green.  \nThey need red to get to goal. I have 14 red.\n\nSo if they want to reach their goal, they must get at least 1 red chip.  \nBut I have excess red — I can give away red to them for blue or green.\n\nBut I don’t need blue or green — I have 2 green, need 1 for my path. I can spare 1 green.\n\nSo I can propose:  \n- I give you 1 red chip for 1 blue chip.  \n- But if I give you a red chip, you can use it to move — but only one red is required on the path? No, different path may need more.\n\nLet’s examine their paths to (3,3).\n\nTheir location: (0,0).  \nTheir chips: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R B B R  \nRow 2: R R B R  \nRow 3: B R R G\n\nPossible path: (0,0) → (0,1): cost 1B → need B  \n→ (0,2): 1B  \n→ (0,3): 1B  \n→ (1,3): cost R → need R  \n→ (2,3"

I already have 70 points.  \nIf I do nothing, I get 70.\n\nIf I trade 1 red for 1 blue, I now have 13 red, 1 blue, 1 green.  \nI still have enough red for my path (5 red needed).  \nSo after using 5 red and 1 green, I have 8 red, 1 blue → total 9 chips → score: 20 + 5×9 = 65 → **less than 70**.\n\nSo trade hurts me — I get fewer chips.\n\nWhat if I trade for green?

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I should demand *something*.  \n\nAlternative: I need help from them only if I *don’t* complete alone — but I **can** complete alone. So I don’t need them.  \n\nWait — if I don’t trade, I get: 20 + 5*5 = 20 + 25 = **45 points** (5 red chips left after using 5, plus 2 green used → total chips left: 14-5=9R, 2-1=1G → 10 chips → 50 points total? Wait — no: scoring is 20 for goal + 5 per chip → 20 + 5*10 = 70? Wait — let's recalculate.\n\nWait — I have 14 red and 2 green = total 16 chips.  \nPath uses: 5 red, 1 green → so 9 red + 1 green = 10 chips left.  \nSo score: 20 + 5*10 = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nIf I don’t go this path, but instead take the shorter one with more blue chips, I would need blue — I have no blue, so I can’t take that without trade. But I can go the red/green path fine alone.\n\nNow consider: if I trade with them, I could potentially get a better outcome? For example, if they give me red chips in exchange for my green or blue? But I have no blue, and I have green which they need.\n\nBut — I can *force* a trade by saying I’ll only help them if they give me at least 15 points.\n\nBut they don’t have red, so they can't pay me for red chips unless I give them green or blue. I have green — they have blue.\n\nThey have 14 blue and 2 green.  \nThey need red to get to goal. I have 14 red.\n\nSo if they want to reach their goal, they must get at least 1 red chip.  \nBut I have excess red — I can give away red to them for blue or green.\n\nBut I don’t need blue or green — I have 2 green, need 1 for my path. I can spare 1 green.\n\nSo I can propose:  \n- I give you 1 red chip for 1 blue chip.  \n- But if I give you a red chip, you can use it to move — but only one red is required on the path? No, different path may need more.\n\nLet’s examine their paths to (3,3).\n\nTheir location: (0,0).  \nTheir chips: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R B B R  \nRow 2: R R B R  \nRow 3: B R R G\n\nPossible path: (0,0) → (0,1): cost 1B → need B  \n→ (0,2): 1B  \n→ (0,3): 1B  \n→ (1,3): cost R → need R  \n→ (2,3"

I lack 1 red chip for this path. However, since the game only charges 1 chip per move, I can still attempt the first move if I have the required chip for the immediate tile.\\n\\nThe immediate next step from (0, 1) along the 5-step path [(0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)] is (1, 1), which is a B (blue) tile. I have 11 blue chips, so I can afford this move. This path uses 3 blue, 1 red, and 1 green chips total. I currently have 11 blue (sufficient), 2 green (enough), and only 1 red (exactly enough). So this entire path is feasible without needing to trade, and I will end with 11 - 3 = 8 blue, 2 - 1 = 1 green, and 1 - 1 = 0 red chips.\\n\\nThus, I will take this path because it avoids any need to trade, and I don’t want to risk the other player not cooperating in future trades. Moreover, even though the other player has many red chips, trading with them would be risky due to potential imbalance or non-beneficial conditions. Since I can complete this path without trading and finish with 8 + 1 = 9 chips (for a bonus of 45 points), plus 20 for reaching the goal, my final score would be 65.\\n\\nIf I choose the shorter path, I’d need to get 1 red chip from the other player. But the contract says: if they reach the goal first, I must give them 20 points. However, if I help them finish early by giving them red chips, it might incentivize them to reach their goal before me — and if they do, they’ll get 20 points from me, which hurts my score. So helping them reach the goal is bad for me unless I *benefit more* from it — but here, I wouldn't gain anything extra, so it’s better to avoid giving them chips unless it directly benefits me.\\n\\nTherefore, I will proceed with my current path using blue chips I already have.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
