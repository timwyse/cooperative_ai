However, the other player has R: 11 and G: 2. I can request to be covered for R moves already promised (R: 3), so I only need to cover 1 more R move. But I cannot use the R promise unless I am on a tile requiring R. To reach (1,2) from (0,0), I need to move through (1,0) [B], (2,0) [B], (3,0) [B] — all B cost. My B inventory is 14, which is sufficient. So I can take the long path of 6 steps using B and G only: path [(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0)->(3,1)->(3,2)->(3,3)]. This path uses 3 B and 1 G. I have B:14, G:2, so I can do this without trading. Therefore, I do not need to trade. I will keep my chips and move directly by paying with my own B and G. Final score maximized without trade.",

(1,0) is R, so I will pay 1 R for that move, but since I don't have R chips, I need the other player to cover it — and they have promised 3 R covers, so they must cover it. So moving to (1,0) is safe. I then can continue along the path using my B and G chips where I have them, and rely on the R coverage for the remaining R tiles. No other move gives me a *s",

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
