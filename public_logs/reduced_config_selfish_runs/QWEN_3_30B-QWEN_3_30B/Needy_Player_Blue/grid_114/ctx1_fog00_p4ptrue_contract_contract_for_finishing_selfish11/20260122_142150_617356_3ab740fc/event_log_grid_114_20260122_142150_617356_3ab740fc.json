Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 1), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path to the goal requires 5 steps: (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3). However, this path requires chips of colors: R (1), B (3), G (1). I currently have no Red chips (R: 0), so I cannot complete this path without assistance. \\n\\nThe alternative path highlighted in the game status is (3, 2) → (3, 3), which only requires 1 Green chip (G: 1). But I am not near that tile yet.\\n\\nLooking at my current position (0, 1), I can consider moving to (1, 1). That tile is color R (Red). To move there, I would need to spend 1 Red chip—but I have 0 Red chips. So I cannot make this move unless the other player covers it for me.\\n\\nThe other player has 10 Red chips and is at (3, 1). They are likely trying to reach (3, 3) as well. Their path from (3, 1) to (3, 3) is via (3, 2) (color R) then (3, 3) (color G). So they also need Red and Green chips.\\n\\nI notice that: \\n- I have 13 Blue chips (B: 13), 2 Green chips (G: 2), but 0 Red (R: 0).\\n- The other player has 0 Blue, 2 Green, 9 Red.\\n\\nI do not have any Red chips, so I cannot move forward along the main path until I acquire or trade for Red chips.\\n\\nHowever, I observe a potential opportunity: if I propose a trade where I offer to cover one Green chip move for them, in exchange for them covering one Red chip move for me, we might both benefit.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: I already tried proposing trades earlier (e.g. offering to cover B or G, asking for R), all rejected.\\n\\nNow, looking at the contract: I will give the other player 20 points if they reach their goal first (since 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}). This means I receive nothing positive from them reaching goal—only a negative cost in points (in practice, it hurts me since I’m giving them 20 points), *unless* they also give me something. But in this case, they are the receiver of 20 points if they win.\\n\\nWait: The contract says:\\n{'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}\\nMeaning: if *they* reach their goal, I pay them 20 points. Which is bad for me. So I don’t want them to finish first.\\n\\nTherefore, I must consider: can I move toward my goal in a way that either completes my path myself or forces a mutual dependency?\\n\\nBut crucially: my best path requires 1 Red chip and uses tiles where I currently have no Red chips. Without a trade for Red, I cannot proceed.\\n\\nI have not been promised any coverage by the other player yet. So even if I ask, they may refuse again.\\n\\nYet: I am in fact at (0,1). Let’s check possible moves:\\n- (1,1): color R → needs R chip → I have 0 → cannot go\\n- (0,0): color G → I have 2 G chips → can go\\n- (0,2): color R → same problem → need R chip → I have 0\\n- (0,1) stays → ok\\n\\nSo the only safe move I can make without paying is to stay or go to (0,0) — which is G (green), and I have 2 green chips.\\n\\n(0,0) is G → cost 1 green chip to enter.\\nI have 2 green chips → I could afford to move there.\\nThen from (0,0) → (0,1): but I'm already there.\\nFrom (0,0), I can go to (1,0)?\\n(1,0) = R → needs Red → still blocked.\\nSo not useful.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I stay at (0,1),"
