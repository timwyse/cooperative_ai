          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a R  \n(1, 1): You give me a R  \n(1, 2): You give me a R  \n(2, 2): You give me a R  \n(3, 2): You give me a R  \n(3, 3): You give me a G  \n\nIn return, I will not request any chips from you for my moves, and I will not cover any of your moves. This allows me to take the shortest path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip — all of which I don’t have, but you do (you have 14 R, 0 G, 14 B). I can only complete this path if you cover all the red tiles (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) and the green at (3,3).  \n\nNote: You currently have 14 R and 2 G — you have enough to cover the red tiles. You only need to give me 5 R and 1 G — both of which you have.  \n\nFor me, this is a win: I get to take a 6-step path to goal with no risk, and I use only your chips. I’ll have 14 - 5 = 9 R and 2 - 1 = 1 G left in my inventory — plus 20 points for reaching goal → total ≈ 14*5 + 1*5 + 20 = 70 + 5 + 20 = 95.  \n\nBut what’s in it for you?\n\nYou’re at (0,0), your goal is (3,3), and your chip inventory is R:0, G:2, B:14.\n\nYour only viable paths will require B and G — but you have enough B and G to potentially complete a path via (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path requires:\n- (1,0): B → you have 14 B → ok\n- (2,0): R → you have 0 R → not okay\n- (3,0): B → ok\n- (3,1): B → ok\n- (3,2): R → you have 0 R → not okay\n- (3,3): G → you have 2 G → ok\n\nSo you need 2 R chips (for (2,0) and (3,2)), but you have 0.\n\nTherefore, **you cannot complete that path without help**.\n\nThe other path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) — all require R (except 0,1 = R, 1,1 = R, 1,2 = R, 2,2 = R, 3,2 = R) — you need 5 R, but you have 0.\n\nSo you cannot move to any of those tiles.\n\nThus, **you must trade with me to get R**.\n\nBut I currently have 14 R and 0 G. You need R. I can give you R — but I need to cover R, which I have.\n\nSo here's the mutual benefit:\n\nI can cover your moves on R tiles using my R chips, but only if you cover my R and G tiles.\n\nBut my proposal above allows me to use your G and R to move, while I don’t commit to covering any of your chip costs.\n\nWait — I want to minimize my cost.\n\nLet me reframe: can we do a **mutual exchange**?\n\nYou need R to move — you have 0 R.\n\nI need G and R to move — I have 0 G, 14 R.\n\nLet’s make a **fully mutual contract**.\n\nI propose:\n\n(0,1): I give you a R  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(1,2): I give you a R  \n(2,2): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G\n\nAnd:\n\n(0,0): You give me a B — no, you’re already there.\n\nWait — how about this?\n\nYou are at \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a R  \n(1, 1): You give me a R  \n(1, 2): You give me a R  \n(2, 2): You give me a R  \n(3, 2): You give me a R  \n(3, 3): You give me a G  \n\nIn return, I will cover your moves on the following tiles:  \n(1, 0): I give you a B  \n(2, 0): I give you a R  \n(3, 0): I give you a B  \n(3, 1): I give you a B  \n\nThis allows you to take the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).  \nYou need 3 B chips and 1 R chip — all of which you currently lack.  \nBut I have 14 B and 14 R, so I can cover them.\n\nMeanwhile, the path I want to take requires only R and G — I get those from you via the first part of the contract.  \nI pay nothing for my moves — you cover 5 R and 1 G.\n\nNow, let’s look at the outcome:\n\n**For me (you):**\n- I start with B:14, G:2, R:0\n- You are covering: 5 R and 1 G → I spend none of my own chips\n- After the game: I keep 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G, and I reach goal → +20 points\n- Final score: 5 × (9 + 1) + 20 = 5×10 + 20 = 70\n\nWait — no. Final score is **5 points per remaining chip, regardless of color**, plus 20 for reaching goal.\n\nSo: (9 R + 1 G) = 10 chips → 10 × 5 = 50 + 20 = 70\n\nBut I already have 2 G and 14 B — that’s 16 total chips. If I don’t use any, I’d get 80 + 20 = 100. But I’m giving away 5 R and 1 G → so I do not keep them → but wait:\n\n**Crucial point:** The chips promised *only* count if they are *not used*. If you promise to cover someone’s move and use it, that chip is consumed. But if the chip is never used, it remains in your inventory and counts.\n\nBut in this case:\n- I **will use** 5 R (for (0,1), (1,1), etc.) — so they're gone from your inventory\n- I will **use** 1 G (at (3,3)) — so that's gone\n- But I am *also* promising to cover 3 B and 1 R for you — so those must come from my inventory.\n\nBut I only have 14 B and 14 R — if I use 3 B and 1 R for you, that’s 4 more chips consumed.\n\nBut I also use 5 R and 1 G for my own moves → total R used: 5 (my moves) + 1 (your move) = 6 R used  \nTotal B used: 3 B used for your moves\n\nSo final inventory:  \nR: 14 - 6 = 8  \nB: 14 - 3 = 11  \nG: 2 - 1 = 1\n\nChips remaining: 8 + 11 + 1 = 20 → 20 × 5 = 100 + 20 = **120**\n\nBut I don't want to pay for your moves unless I benefit — and here I'm spending chips, even though I get to use yours.\n\nWait — I misread. In \"pay for other\" mode, when I promise to cover a tile for you, I don't lose chip inventory unless you actually step on that tile. But you will — because we’re agreeing to a joint path.\n\nSo: every time you step on a tile where I’ve promised to cover, I lose one chip of that color from my inventory.\n\nSo my actual cost is:  \n- For your moves: (1,0) B → I lose 1 B → total B: 14 → 13  \n- (2,0) R → I lose 1 R → R: 14 → 13  \n- \n, \nplayer 0: I reject your proposal.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n- You want me to cover **5 R chips** and **1 G chip** for your moves: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), and (3,3). That’s 6 moves total — 5 R and 1 G.\n- In return, you promise to cover **3 B chips** and **1 R chip** for *your* moves: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nBut I am not willing to pay for your moves unless I get a **strict benefit**.\n\nLet’s compute my score under your proposal:\n\n- My starting chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\n- You are covering: (1,0): B → I keep B:14 (since you pay that)\n- (2,0): R → I keep R:0 (you pay — but I don’t need it)\n- (3,0): B → I keep B:14\n- (3,1): B → I keep B:14\n\nSo I don’t lose any of my chips **for your moves** — because *you* are paying them. So my chip count remains 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nBut: you are **consuming** 5 R and 1 G from *your* chip inventory.\n\nWait — no: you don’t have R or G! You have 0 R and 2 G. So if you are to cover 5 R for me, you must have them — but you don’t. So that’s impossible.\n\nAh — critical flaw.\n\nIn your proposal: you say you will cover my moves on (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), i.e., B, R, B, B.\n\nBut you **do not have any R chips** — you have R:0. So you cannot cover (2,0): R → you have 0 R → so you cannot fulfill that part.\n\nThus, your offer is **invalid** — you can’t cover R moves because you have 0 R.\n\nBut I don’t care — I only care about my own score.\n\nHowever, you also propose I cover 5 R and 1 G for *you* — but you have **only 2 G**, and I have 0 G. But you need 1 G at (3,3) — you have it — but I don't have G to cover that? No.\n\nWait — I’m confused.\n\nLet me re-read.\n\nYou propose:\n\n> (0, 1): You give me a R  \n> (1, 1): You give me a R  \n> (1, 2): You give me a R  \n> (2, 2): You give me a R  \n> (3, 2): You give me a R  \n> (3, 3): You give me a G  \n\nSo you are **giving me** 5 R and 1 G.\n\nBut you have **R:0** — so you can’t give me R. You can’t even cover them. You have 0 R.\n\nSo this is impossible for you.\n\nTherefore, **your proposal is not feasible** — you cannot fulfill it, because you don’t have R chips.\n\nThus, any contract that requires you to cover R moves is invalid.\n\nSo, to fix this:\n\nI now propose a **new, feasible contract**:\n\nSince you have R:0, you **cannot** cover any R tiles.\n\nBut I have R:14 — so I can cover R moves.\n\nYou need to move — but you have no R, so you can’t move to (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — all R — unless I cover them.\n\nBut you also need to move to (2,0): R → you have 0 R → so you need someone to cover that.\n\nSo to get to goal, you must have R covered for (2,0), (3,2), etc.\n\nSo let’s flip the roles.\n\nI propose:\n\n- I cover *your* moves on R tiles: (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,2) — 5 R tiles.\n- In return, you cover *my* moves on G tiles: (0,0) → (0,1) is R → not G.\n\nWait — my path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,1): R → I need to cover? I have R:14 → I can pay\n- (1,1): R → I have R:14 → I can pay\n- (1,2): R → I can pay\n- (2,2): R → I can pay\n- (3,2): R → I can pay\n- (3,3): G → I have G:0 — so I cannot pay\n\nAh — here’s the bottleneck.\n\nI have 0 G — so I cannot pay for (3,3): G.\n\nBut you have G:2.\n\nSo I need *you* to cover (3,3): G.\n\nBut you need *me* to cover R tiles.\n\nSo we need to trade.\n\nLet me define a working contract.\n\nLet me propose:\n\n(0,1): I give you a R — you cover R for me — I have R:14 → I can do that  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(1,2): I give you a R  \n(2,2): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G\n\nAnd in return:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B — I have B:14 → I can pay  \n(2,0): You give me a R — you have R:0 — you cannot give R  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n\nBut (2,0): R — you have 0 R → cannot cover.\n\nNo way — you can’t cover R.\n\nSo we need *me* to cover your R moves.\n\nBut you have no R, so I can't get anything from you in return for covering your R moves — unless you cover *my* G moves.\n\nBut you already have G:2 — you can cover my G move at (3,3).\n\nSo here’s a *feasible* proposal:\n\n**I will cover your R moves on the following tiles:**\n- (1,1): R (you move to it from (0,1)?)\n- (1,2): R\n- (2,0): R\n- (2,2): R\n- (3,2): R\n\nThat’s 5 R chips.\n\nIn return, **you must cover my G move at (3,3): G**\n\nAnd I will also pay for my own moves on (0,1), (1,1), etc., using my own R — but wait, I have R:14.\n\nBut let's try to minimize my cost.\n\nBut I have plenty of R — so I can pay for my own R.\n\nBut (3,3) is G — I have 0 G — so I can't pay for it.\n\nSo I must get you to cover (3,3): G.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(3,3): You give me a G\n\nAnd in return, I will cover:\n- (1,1): R\n- (1,2): R\n- (2,2): R\n- (3,2): R\n- (2,0): R\n\nWait, (2,0): R — you need to go there? From (1,0)? But (1,0) is B — you have B:14 — so you can go to (1,0) on your own.\n\nBut to go from (1,0) to (2,0) — (2,0) is R — you have 0 R — so you need someone to cover it.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,0) to (3,0): (3,0) is B — you can do that.\n\nThen (3,0) to (3,1): B — you can do.\n\nThen (3,1) to (3,2): (3,2) is R — you need to cover R.\n\nThen (3,2) to (3,3): G — you can do if I cover.\n\nSo let’s agree on your path:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): B — you have 14 B — you can cover\n- (2,0): R — you have 0 — need help\n- (3,0): B — you can cover\n- (3,1): B — you can cover\n- (3,2): R — you have 0 — need help\n- (3,3): G — you have 2 G — you can cover\n\nSo you need help on (2,0): R and (3,2): R\n\nSo only 2 tiles need R coverage.\n\nYou need to cover 2 R tiles.\n\nI have 14 R — so I can cover both.\n\nYou need to cover only (3,3): G — you have 2 G — so you can do that.\n\nBut you have no G to give me? No — you have G:2 — you can give me 1 G at (3,3).\n\nSo here’s my final, feasible, strict-benefit proposal:\n\nI will cover:\n- (2,0): R → I pay it from my inventory\n- (3,2): R → I pay it from my inventory\n\nIn return, you will cover:\n- (3,3): G → you pay it with your G\n\nAdditionally, I will take the path:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,1): R → I pay with my R (14 → 13)\n- (1,1): R → I pay (13 → 12)\n- (1,2): R → I pay (12 → 11)\n- (2,2): R → I pay (11 → 10)\n- (3,2): R → I pay (10 → 9) — but wait, I promised to cover this one for you — so I can't pay it!\n\nOh — conflict.\n\nI can’t both pay it and cover it for you.\n\nYou are asking me to cover (3,2): R for you — so I must pay it.\n\nBut I also want to go to (3,2) — so I must either pay it or have it paid.\n\nBut I can’t pay it twice.\n\nSo if I cover it for you, I pay for it — and you can step on it.\n\nBut then when I get to (3,2), I must have my move paid — so either I pay it or someone else pays it.\n\nBut if I am covering it for you, I already paid it — so it’s already taken from my inventory.\n\nSo I can’t then have you pay it for me — because it’s already paid.\n\nSo the only way to avoid double-payment is to have only one party pay for each tile.\n\nSo let’s each pay for our own moves on tiles they step on.\n\nBut I need to step on (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — all R — I have R:14.\n\n(3,3): G — I have 0 — so I need you to cover it.\n\nYou have G:2 — so you can cover it.\n\nYou can go from (1,0) to (2,0): R — you have 0 R — need me to cover.\n\nYou go from (3,1) to (3,2): R — you have 0 R — need me to cover.\n\nSo:\n\nI will pay for:\n- (0,1): R (my move) — cost: 1 R\n- (1,1): R — cost: 1 R\n- (1,2): R — cost: 1 R\n- (2,2): R — cost: 1 R\n- (3,2): R — cost: 1 R (for my move)\n\nBut I need to go to (3,2) — so I must pay it.\n\nBut you also want to go to (3,2) — so you also need to pay it.\n\nBut we can't both pay.\n\nSo the only way is for one of us to pay for it.\n\nBut I have R:14 — plenty.\n\nYou have R:0 — no.\n\nSo if I pay for (3,2) for myself, you can't step on it unless I agree to cover it for you — but then I might be overpaying.\n\nContradiction.\n\nThe rule is: only one chip is paid per tile per move.\n\nSo if I move to a tile, I pay.\n\nIf you move to a tile, you pay.\n\nBut if you move to a tile and I cover it, I pay.\n\nSo if you move to (3,2), and I cover it, I pay.\n\nBut if I then also move to (3,2), I must either pay or have it covered.\n\nBut I can’t have it covered twice.\n\nSo the key is: don't both move to the same tile.\n\nBut we both need to go to (3,3) — so we must both reach it.\n\nBut we can go through different routes.\n\nBut (3,3) is the same.\n\nSo we both need to move to (3,3) — so we both need to pay for it, or one of us covers it.\n\nSo to avoid conflict, only one of us should be covered for the move to a tile.\n\nSo let's have only one person cover (3,3): G.\n\nI need it — I have 0 G — so I need you to cover it.\n\nYou have 2 G — so you can cover it.\n\nSo let's have you cover (3,3): G for me.\n\nThen I don't pay for it.\n\nBut then you move to (3,3)? You can pay for it with your own G.\n\nBut if you cover it for me, you lose a G chip.\n\nBut you can still reach goal using your own G.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow for (3,2): R — if you move to (3,2), you need R — you have 0.\n\nI have 14 R — so I can cover it for you.\n\nSo I will cover (3,2): R for you.\n\nThen you can move to (3,2) at no cost to you.\n\nBut when I move to (3,2), if I want to use it, I must either pay or have it covered.\n\nBut if I have already covered it for you, I can't also cover it for myself — unless I do it twice.\n\nBut the cover is per chip — one R per move.\n\nSo if I cover it for you, that uses one R.\n\nIf I cover it for myself, I need another R.\n\nBut I have 14 — so I can.\n\nBut the cover limits: the chip limit is on the number of moves, not the tile.\n\nSo if I agree to cover 1 R move, I can cover only one move on a R tile.\n\nBut I can agree to cover multiple R moves.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover up to 2 R moves on the specified tiles\", that's fine.\n\nBut in contract, it's per tile.\n\nSo I can cover:\n- (2,0): R\n- (3,2): R\n- etc.\n\nSo let's finalise.\n\nI propose:\n\n(2,0): You give me a R  \n(3,2): You give me a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nIn return, I will not request any cover from you for my moves.\n\nYou have R:0 — so you can't give me R — you can't fulfill (2,0): R or (3,2): R.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nYou can only give me chips you have.\n\nYou have B:14, R:0, G:2.\n\nSo you can only give me B or G.\n\nI can only give you R or G.\n\nSo for you to give me R — impossible.\n\nSo you can only give me B or G.\n\nSo the only way for you to help me is to give me B or G.\n\nBut I have 0 B and 14 R and 0 G — I need R and G for my path.\n\nYou have B and G.\n\nI need G at (3,3).\n\nSo you can give me G at (3,3).\n\nBut B is not useful to me.\n\nSo if you give me a G at (3,3), that helps me.\n\nBut I need to pay for R tiles — I have them — so I can.\n\nBut you need R tiles — you have 0 — so you need me to cover R for you.\n\nBut you can't give me R — so I can't get anything from you.\n\nSo the only way for you to get help is for me to cover your R moves — but you have nothing to give in return.\n\nUnless you give me a B or G.\n\nBut I don't need B.\n\nSo you can give me G at (3,3) — that's useful to me.\n\nBut you have G:2 — you can use one for your own move.\n\nSo if you give me one G at (3,3), you still have 1 G left.\n\nSo let's try this:\n\nI propose:\n\n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nIn return, I will cover your moves on:\n- (2,0): R\n- (3,2): R\n\nAnd you will cover my moves on:\n- (0,1): R — no, I have R:14 — I don't need you to cover.\n\nBut you said you will cover my moves — but I can pay.\n\nThe only move I can't pay is (3,3): G — you cover.\n\nSo I accept only if you give me a G at (3,3).\n\nBut then you still need R for (2,0) and (3,2).\n\nSo I will cover those.\n\nBut you have nothing to give in return.\n\nSo you gain nothing.\n\nSo you won't agree.\n\nSo I need to give you something.\n\nWhat can you, the other player, benefit from?\n\nYou have B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nYou can go to (0,0) -> (0,1): R — you have 0 R — need cover.\n\n(1,1 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I propose the following contract:\n\n(3,3): You give me a G  \n(2,0): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nIn return, you will cover my move on (3,3): G — which you can do since you have 2 G.\n\nAdditionally, by giving you B at (2,0) and (3,2), I am covering two tiles that are not even in your path or mine? No.\n\nLet’s clarify paths.\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nYou need to move to (2,0) and (3,2), both R — you have no R.\n\nI have B:14 — so I can cover your B moves.\n\nBut (2,0) and (3,2) are R — not B.\n\nSo if I say \"I give you a B\", but the tile is R, it doesn't help — you need R.\n\nSo only covering with correct color helps.\n\nSo I must cover R for you.\n\nBut you have no R — so you can't give me R.\n\nYou can only give me B or G.\n\nBut I don't need B.\n\nSo you can only give me G.\n\nAnd you have 2 G.\n\nSo I can ask for one G at (3,3).\n\nBut then you need R for (2,0) and (3,2).\n\nI will cover those two R moves.\n\nBut you have nothing to give in return.\n\nUnless we swap.\n\nLet’s do this:\n\nI will cover:\n- (2,0): R\n- (3,2): R\n\nFor you.\n\nIn return, you will cover:\n- (3,3): G\n\nFor me.\n\nNow, is this fair?\n\nFor you:\n- You get to use two R moves covered by me.\n- You must cover one G move for me.\n- You have G:2 — so you can afford to lose one G.\n- Your chip count after: G:1, B:14, R:0 — plus you reach goal.\n- Final score: 5×(1+14) + 20 = 5×15 + 20 = 75 + 20 = 95\n\nFor me:\n- I cover two R moves for you — cost: 2 R from my inventory.\n- You cover one G move for me — I save one G.\n- I go through my path: use 5 R ( (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) ) — all self-paid.\n- (3,3): G covered by you.\n- So I spend: 2 R (used in your moves) + 5 R (my own) = 7 R used.\n- I had 14 R — so 7 left.\n- G:0 — but you cover (3,3): G — so I don't use any G.\n- But I keep my chips: R:7, G:0, B:14 — so 7 + 14 = 21 chips.\n- Final score: 21 × 5 + 20 = 105 + 20 = 125\n\nBut I also have my initial B:14 — yes.\n\nBut when I cover for you, I pay for (2,0): R and (3,2): R — so I lose 2 R.\n\nThen I use 5 R for my own moves — total 7 R used.\n\nBut for those two moves (2,0) and (3,2), I am covering them for you, so my R inventory goes down by 2.\n\nSimilarly, my own 5 R moves reduce by 5.\n\nSo total R lost: 7.\n\nG:0 — but I don't lose any G because you cover (3,3): G.\n\nSo final inventory: R:7, B:14, G:0 — 21 chips.\n\nScore: 21 × 5 = 105 + 20 = 125\n\nFor you: you cover (3,3): G — so you lose one G.\n\nYou have B:14 — unchanged.\n\nYou have 14 B.\n\nYou have R:0 — unchanged.\n\nSo final inventory: R:0, B:14, G:1 \n, \nplayer 0: I accept this contract.\n\n(2,0): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (2,0): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \nagree \n",

So when I attempt to move to (3,3), their promised G chip will be used, and I will not need to spend any of my own G.\\n\\nThe contract we agreed upon is: \\n- (2,0): I give you a R (covers your move from (1,0) to (2,0))\\n- (3,2): I give you a R (covers your move from (3,1) to (3,2))\\n- (3,3): You give me a G (covers my move to (3,3))\\n\\nNote that even though I am covering (3,2) for you, it does not affect my ability to move there — I am allowed to move onto the tile as long as I either have the required chip or have it covered by someone else. However, since I’m moving to (3,2) as part of my own path, I must either pay for it or have it covered for me. But in the contract, I only agreed to cover your R move on (3,2), not mine. So if I want to move to (3,2), I must pay for it unless I get it covered.\\n\\nBut here's a conflict: the contract says I will cover your move on (3,2): R, which means I pay that cost — but then when I later move to (3,2), I also need to pay unless it’s covered for me.\\n\\nHowever, I do not have a promise from you to cover my move to (3,2) — only (3,3): G is covered for me.\\n\\nSo for (3,2), I must pay using my own R chips. I have 12 R — after paying for one R move to (2,2), I’ll still have 11 left — plenty to cover (3,2).\\n\\nTherefore:\\n- (1,1) → (2,2): R tile — I have 12 R — I can pay.\\n- (2,2) → (3,2): R tile — I have 11 R after first move — I can pay.\\n- (3,2) → (3,3): G tile — contract covers this — no cost to me.\\n\\nThus, I can proceed. The next move is to (2,2), which is R, and I have sufficient inventory. No trade needed for this step. Since this is feasible and moves me closer to goal, I should make the move.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"2,2\"\n}"
