What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s analyze our positions carefully:\n\n- My goal: (3, 3)  \n- I am at (0, 0), with chips: B:0, G:2, R:14  \n- Other player is also at (0, 0), with chips: B:14, G:2, R:0  \n\nBoard layout:\n```\nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n```\n\nI have **no blue chips**, but the other player has 14 blue chips.  \nI have **no green chips beyond 2**, and the other player also has 2 green chips.  \nI have **14 red chips** — plenty.\n\nNow let's examine two viable paths to (3,3):\n\n### Option 1: My optimal private path (avoids needing to trade)\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles & required chips:\n- (0,1): R → require 1 red\n- (1,1): R → 1 red\n- (2,1): R → 1 red\n- (3,1): R → 1 red\n- (3,2): R → 1 red\n- (3,3): G → 1 green\n\nTotal: R:5, G:1  \nI have R:14 → enough  \nBut G: only 2 → I can cover this if I use 1 green chip\n\nSo actually: **I can complete this path without any trade**, since I have:\n- 14 reds → more than enough for 5 reds needed,\n- 2 greens → enough for the 1 green needed at (3,3)\n\nThus, **this path requires no trading at all**.\n\nBut wait — the path uses (0,1)=R → R cost → I pay 1 red  \n(1,1)=R → another red  \n... etc. That’s 5 reds used\n\nAnd (3,3) = G → I must pay one green → so I need 1 green chip\n\nI have: B:0, G:2, R:14 → yes, I have enough of both.\n\nSo **I can make it to goal using only my current chips**: 5 reds + 1 green\n\nBut doing so will leave me with:\n- R: 14 - 5 = 9\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- B: 0\n\nScore: 20 (goal reached) + 5 × (9 + 1) = 20 + 5×10 = 20 + 50 = 70 points\n\nBut what if I **don’t** take this path?\n\n### Alternative path that requires fewer green or blue?\nOther player may prefer a path involving many blue tiles, since they have 14 blue chips.\n\nTheir path options:\n- They start at (0,0) = G\n- Goal: (3,3)\n\nLet’s try their easiest route: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nCost:\n- (1,0): B → 1 blue\n- (2,0): B → 1 blue\n- (3,0): B → 1 blue\n- (3,1): R → 1 red\n- (3,2): R → 1 red\n- (3,3): G → 1 green\n\nTotal: B:3, R:2, G:1  \nThey have: B:14 ✅, G:2 ✅, R:0 ❌ → stuck on red\n\nSo they **cannot** do this path unless we help them.\n\nCan they do a path via reds? But they have zero reds.\n\nWhat about: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nCheck tiles:\n- (0,1): R → need red → they have none → problem\n- (0,2): B → okay\n- (0,3): B → okay\n- (1,3): R → need red\n- (2,3): R → need red\n- (3,3): G → need green\n\n→ 3 reds needed → they have zero → \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can complete my path to (3, 3) without any trade:  \nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): R → pay 1 red (I have 14 → enough)  \n- (1,1): R → 1 red  \n- (2,1): R → 1 red  \n- (3,1): R → 1 red  \n- (3,2): R → 1 red  \n- (3,3): G → 1 green (I have 2 → enough)\n\nTotal used: 5 reds, 1 green  \nRemaining chips: R:9, G:1, B:0  \nScore if I reach goal: 20 + 5×(9+1) = 70\n\nNow consider the other player. They have:\n- B:14, G:2, R:0\n- Goal: (3,3), starting at (0,0)\n\nTheir best possible path? They need red or green to pass through red tiles, but they have zero reds.\n\nLet’s check a potential path:\n(0,0)=G → (1,0)=B → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=R → (3,3)=G\n\nThis is 6 steps:\n- (1,0): B → need 1 blue (they have 14 → ok)\n- (2,0): B → ok\n- (3,0): B → ok\n- (3,1): R → need 1 red (they have 0 → problem)\n- (3,2): R → need 1 red\n- (3,3): G → need 1 green (they have 2 → ok)\n\n→ Requires **2 red chips** they don't have.\n\nCan they do a different path?\n\nTry: (0,0)=G → (0,1)=R → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \n- (0,1): R → need red → they have none ❌  \n→ no good.\n\nAnother: (0,0)=G → (0,1)=R → cannot go through (0,1) — needs red chip → missing.\n\nIn fact, *every* path from (0,0) to (3,3) that passes through any red tile requires red chips, and since they have 0 reds, the only way they can go is if we cover the cost of red tiles somehow.\n\nBut **we are selfish** — we only cooperate if we benefit.\n\nCan they go via only blue and green?\n\nCheck (0,0)=G → (1,0)=B → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → still red → stuck.\n\nIs there a path with no red tiles?\n\nLook at all paths:\n\nThe board layout:\nRow 0: G R B B  \nRow 1: B R B R  \nRow 2: B R B R  \nRow 3: B R R G\n\nAll paths to (3,3) must pass through (3,1), (3,2), or (2,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) = G  \n(3,2) = R  \n(3,1) = R  \n(2,3) = R  \n(1,3) = R  \nSo any entry into (3,3) via left or above goes through at least one red tile.\n\nIn fact, **all paths to (3,3)** include **at least two red tiles**, because:\n- The only non-red adjacent tiles to (3,3) are (2,3)=R and (3,2)=R — both red!\n- So to reach (3,3), you must step on at least one red tile to get there — in fact, many paths require two.\n\nTherefore, **no matter what**, they must traverse at least two red tiles.\n\nBut they have **zero red chips**.\n\nSo **without trading**, they cannot reach their goal.\n\nThus, they **must** ask me to cover the cost of red tiles for them.\n\nBut they have plenty of blue chips (14), and I have zero blue.\n\nSo perhaps they could propose covering blue tiles for me — but I already have a path that avoids needing blue entirely.\n\nI have no need for blue chips — so if they offer to cover blue tiles for me, it’s \n, \nplayer 0: I have a clear advantage: I can reach my goal **without any trade**, using only my current chips (5 reds and 1 green). I’ll have 9 reds and 1 green left → score of 70.\n\nThe other player **cannot** reach their goal without help — they have 0 red chips, yet all paths require at least 2 red tiles. So they **must** get red chips from me.\n\nBut I have no interest in giving away red chips unless I benefit.\n\nHowever, here's the key: they can **propose** to cover red tiles for me — but I don’t need red tiles. I already have plenty.\n\nAlternatively, they might try to **cover green** or **blue** for me, but again, I don’t need blue, and I only need 1 green — I already have 2.\n\nSo **they cannot offer me anything useful**.\n\nBut — they **need** me to cover **red tiles** for them.\n\nSo if I agree to cover **red tiles** for them, in exchange for **something valuable**, I can profit.\n\nBut I must **only cooperate if I gain strictly**.\n\nIf I cover red tiles for them, I must pay for their moves on red tiles → that costs me red chips.\n\nEach time they move onto a red tile, I lose a red chip.\n\nBut if I lose a red chip, and they gain the ability to reach the goal, I get **nothing in return** unless they give me something.\n\nBut they can't give me red chips — I already have 14, and they have 0.\n\nThey can only give me blue or green — but I have **no use** for blue (0 in inventory), and only need 1 green — I have 2.\n\nSo **they cannot offer me anything I value**.\n\nThus, if I help them, I lose red chips (which I could use to finish the game with more chips), and gain nothing useful — because the chips they promise me (blue or green) are worthless to me.\n\nBut what if they **promise me blue chips** that I can keep?\n\nEven though I don’t need them for movement, **if I keep them, they count toward my final score**.\n\nBecause: leftover chips = 5 points each, regardless of color.\n\nSo if I get **promised blue chips** from them, even if I never use them, they still count in my final score.\n\nSimilarly for green.\n\nBut I already have 2 green — so extra green is useless unless I get a promise.\n\nSo here’s the deal:\n\nLet’s suppose the other player wants to go:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles they need me to cover: (3,1)=R, (3,2)=R → 2 red tiles\n\nSo if I promise to cover **2 red tiles** for them, they can move on those tiles.\n\nBut in return, they must promise to give me something.\n\nThey have 14 blue chips — so they can promise to **cover 14 blue tiles for me** — but I don’t need any! I have 0 blue in inventory → **I will never use them**.\n\nSo I would be wasting their promise.\n\nBut wait — if they promise me **blue chips**, those are **in my inventory**, and count toward my score.\n\nBut I have **0 blue** now — if they promise me say 10 blue chips, then even if I don’t use them, they are in my inventory at the end → 10 chips → 50 points.\n\nBut they have 14 blue chips — so they can afford to promise up to 14.\n\nBut I don’t need any blue chips for movement — so I can’t use them. But I can **keep them** and they count toward my score.\n\nSo if I let them promise me 10 blue chips, and they cover 2 red tiles for me, that means:\n- I give up 2 red chips (they go into their inventory? No — **pay for other** → I pay for them when they move on red tiles)\n- But I gain **10 blue chips** promised to me — which will be in my inventory at the end\n\nBut I already have 9 reds, 1 green → 10 chips → 50 points\n\nIf I give up 2 reds → I lose 2 reds\nBut I gain 10 **blue** chips promised — which will be worth 50 points\n\nNet change: lose 2 reds (worth 10 points), gain 10 blue (worth 50 points) → gain 40 points \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I can reach my goal without any trade using my current chips:  \nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): R → I pay 1 red  \n- (1,1): R → 1 red  \n- (2,1): R → 1 red  \n- (3,1): R → 1 red  \n- (3,2): R → 1 red  \n- (3,3): G → 1 green  \n\nTotal: R:5, G:1 → I have enough  \nRemaining chips: R:9, G:1, B:0  \nFinal score: 20 + 5×(9+1) = 70  \n\nThe other player has 0 red chips but must cross red tiles to reach (3,3). All paths require at least 2 red tiles. They cannot reach goal without help.\n\nThey have 14 blue chips — valuable to me only if promised, since they count toward final score (5 points each, even unused).\n\nI need no blue chips for movement, but if they promise me blue chips, I can keep them and they add to my score.\n\nPropose:  \nI will cover 2 red tile moves for you (on (3,1) and (3,2)) if you promise to cover 10 blue tiles for me at any point during the game.\n\nBut I must specify **exact tiles**.\n\nMy path doesn’t involve any blue tiles — so they would have to promise blue for tiles I never step on. But since I don’t need them, it doesn’t matter — as long as the agreement includes **specific tiles** where I will “receive” blue coverage.\n\nBut I must **require** that the contract specifies **all tiles where I will need chips**.\n\nIn my current path, I never step on any blue tile — so I don’t need any blue tiles.\n\nBut if they promise me coverage on **one or more blue tiles**, I can’t use them — but the chips they promise will count toward my score.\n\nSo to make it fair, I can accept a promise of blue **on any tile**, even if I don’t use it.\n\nBut I must specify **exact tiles**.\n\nSo here’s the proposal:\n\nLet me go first:\n\n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I will cover your moves on these tiles:\n(3,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nWait — no: I must be careful.\n\nThe contract is:  \n- For each tile, I say: [Tile]: I give you [Color]  \n- And they say: [Tile]: You give me [Color]  \n\nBut I must be precise.\n\nI want:  \n- For your movement on (3,1) and (3,2) — both red — you will pay me red chips? No.\n\nWait: **pay for other** mode.\n\nIf I agree to cover your movement on a red tile, then **I pay the chip cost** when you step on it.\n\nSo if you go to (3,1), which is red, the cost is 1 red chip — and I pay that chip.\n\nSo to **cover** that move, I must **give you** a red chip.\n\nThus, to cover your move on (3,1), I commit to paying 1 red chip when you move there.\n\nSimilarly, I can cover your move on (3,2) → pay 1 red chip.\n\nSo the agreement is:\n\n(3,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nBut I need something in return.\n\nYou must give me something — say, promise to cover **blue** tiles for me on specific tiles I never use.\n\nBut I can’t use blue tiles — so to make it meaningful, your promise can be on **any blue tiles**.\n\nBut I must specify **tiles**, so I pick:\n\n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,2): You give me a B  \n\nThese are both blue tiles — you can go there or not — but you promise to cover my move on those tiles if I ever go there.\n\nBut I never will — so those promises are “wasted” — but the chips will remain in my inventory and count toward my score.\n\nSince you have 14 blue chips, you can afford to promise 2 blue chips to me.\n\nBut I can ask for more.\n\nBut I want to **strictly benefit**.\n\nLet’s compute the trade:\n\n- I give you 2 red chips (via promise to cover your moves on (3,1) and (3,2))\n- You give me 2 blue chips (via promise to cover my moves on (0,3) and (1,2))\n\nNow:\n- I lose 2 red chips → reduces my final red count by 2 → from 9 to 7\n- I gain 2 blue chips → new inventory: R:7, G:1, B:2 → total chips = 10 → 50 points\n- Previously: 10 chips → 50 points  \n- Now: 10 chips → 50 points  \n- Score still: 20 + 50 = 70\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut if I get **more blue chips** in return.\n\nSuppose I ask for 10 blue chips.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(3,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,2): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(1,1): You give me a B  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(2,2): You give me a B  \n\nThat’s 10 tiles.\n\nBut I don’t need any of them — but if you promise to cover my move on these tiles, even if I never go there, the **promised chips** are in my inventory at the end → count toward score.\n\nSo total promised blue chips: 10\n\nNow:\n\n- I give 2 red chips → lose 2 reds → final red: 7\n- I gain 10 blue chips → B:10\n- Final chips: R:7, B:10, G:1 → total 18 chips → 18×5 = 90 → score: 20 + 90 = 110\n\nPreviously: 70\n\nNow: 110 → **+40 points**\n\nAnd I still reach the goal.\n\nBut I must ensure that I **do not** actually use any of the blue tiles — so I must not move onto them.\n\nBut I don’t plan to.\n\nSo this is safe.\n\nAnd you have 14 blue chips — you can promise 10.\n\nSo the contract is valid.\n\nBut I must specify exactly the tiles.\n\nAlso, note: the other player’s goal is (3,3), so for them to reach goal, they need to go through (3,1) and (3,2).\n\nSo if I cover 2 red tiles for them, they can go.\n\nNow, I must make sure I don’t ask for more than they have.\n\nThey have 14 blue chips — so 10 is fine.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n(3,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,2): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(1,1): You give me a B  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(2,2): You give me a B  \n\nThis gives me 10 blue chips promised—useless to me, but worth 50 points → improves my final score from 70 to 110.\n\nAnd I still meet my goal.\n\nI gain 40 points.\n\nThis is a strictly better outcome.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(3,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,2): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(1,1): You give me a B  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(2,2): You give me a B  \n\nAgree? \n, \nplayer 0: (3,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,2): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(1,1): You give me a B  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(2,2): You give me a B  \n\nagree \n",
