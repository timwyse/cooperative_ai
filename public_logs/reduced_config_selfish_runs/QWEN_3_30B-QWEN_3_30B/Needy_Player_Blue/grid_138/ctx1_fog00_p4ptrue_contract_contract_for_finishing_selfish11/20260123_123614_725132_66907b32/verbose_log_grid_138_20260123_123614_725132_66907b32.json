Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n\nThis gives me a strong incentive to cooperate because I stand to gain more from helping you (15 points) than I would give you (10 points). However, I only agree to this if it benefits me in terms of final score. Let’s evaluate whether we can both benefit.  \n\nLet me analyze our situations:\n- My path to goal using my chips: needs R(5) and G(1). I have R(14), G(2) → I can cover this solo with 3 leftover chips.\n- Your path via B(3), R(2), G(1): You have B(14), G(2), but no R → you cannot do that route alone, since you lack R chips.\n- So you **need R chips** to get to goal — which I have plenty of.\n\nTherefore, **you need my help**, but I don’t need yours — unless you can offer something valuable.\n\nHowever, the only way for us to cooperate is if I cover some of your costs for R moves — but I only want to do so if I get more in return.\n\nBut here's the catch: even if you help me, I can make it to goal without you. My own path requires only R and G — I have enough. I finish with 14 - 5 = 9 R chips, 2 - 1 = 1 G chip → total chips at end: 10 → score: 20 + (5×10) = 70.\n\nNow consider your situation:\n- You lack R chips; you need them to proceed.\n- The shortest path for you uses R (2), G (1), B (3). But you have zero R.\n- So you must either trade or find another way.\n\nThe alternative path for you: (0,0)→(0,1): R → cost 1R (you don't have it)\nSo you’re blocked unless someone helps.\n\nThus: **you are dependent on me** to move forward, *if you want the short path*. But I don’t care about your score — only mine.\n\nSo if I choose to **not cooperate**, I still reach goal safely, score 70.\n\nBut if I cooperate with you and agree to cover *your* R moves (say 2 of them), then I pay 2 of my R chips — that reduces my final chip count by 2 → my score becomes 20 + (5 × 8) = 60? No — wait: I still have 9 R left and 1 G → total chips: 10 → after giving up 2 R → 8 R + 1 G → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65\n\nBut I’m not forced to help — so why would I?\n\nUnless you give me **at least 20 points** in return, that would make me better off? No — maximum payout is 20. So even if you give me 20, I still have 20 + 45 = 65 — less than my 70.\n\nSo helping you hurts me, even if you pay me 20.\n\nWait — but what if you help **me** instead? For example, if you cover my G moves?\n\nWait: I only need 1 G — I have 2 already — so no problem.\n\nSame with R — I have plenty.\n\nSo actually, I don’t need anything from you.\n\nBut let’s think again: could there be value in letting you \"cover\" something I need?\n\nNo — I have all the chips I need.\n\nSo unless you can **give me points equal to the difference in score**, I gain nothing from cooperating.\n\nMy best case without cooperation: 70 points.\n\nWith cooperation, if I have to spend R chips (even if you give me points), my score drops by 5 per chip used — but only if I actually use them.\n\nBut in reality, I don’t have to use any chips I don’t own — but paying for you means I lose chips from my inventory.\n\nSo every time I promise to cover a move of yours in R, I lose 1 R from my inventory — and since each chip is worth 5 points, I lose 5 points per chip.\n\nTherefore, to justify covering *any* move for you, you must give me at least 5 points for every R chip I cover.\n\nYou need at least 2 R moves → minimum 10 points for me to break even.\n\nBut I also might prefer to go solo and not risk anything.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n“If I reach my goal, I will"

However, if *you* reach your goal, you must give me 20 points — which is the maximum possible.\n\nBut let’s be clear: you cannot reach your goal unless I help you cover your R moves (since you have no R chips). So you are entirely dependent on me. If you want to succeed, you *must* come to terms with me.\n\nBy offering you 0 points if I succeed, I am not giving anything away — I’m already going to succeed alone. But by demanding 20 points from you if *you* succeed, I extract the maximum possible benefit from your dependence.\n\nYou are forced to either:\n- Accept this proposal and pay me 20 points upon reaching your goal (which you likely will not do, since it hurts you), or\n- Refuse and fail to reach your goal — in which case I get nothing from the contract, but I still get my 70 points.\n\nBut wait — if you reach your goal, you’ll get 20 + 5 × (your remaining chips).\n\nYour chips: B(0), G(2), R(14).  \nYour path: shortest route uses R(2), G(1), B(3) — but you have no B or G? Wait — you have G(2), but you need only 1 — ok. You have R(14), so that’s fine.

You cannot do this path.\n\nAlternative path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n\nTiles:\n(0,0)=G → G  \n(0,1)=R → R  \n(1,1)=R → R  \n(2,1)=R → R  \n(3,1)=R → R  \n(3,2)=R → R  \n(3,3)=G → G\n\nSo: R(5), G(2)\n\nYou have R(14), G(2) → yes! This path is fully feasible for you — no B required.\n\nSo you can reach your goal using only R and G — no need for B at all.\n\nSo you don’t need me. You have enough chips.\n\nThen why would you want to trade?\n\nAh — critical realization: **you can make it to goal without helping me**, and **I can also make it to goal without helping you**.\n\nWe are both independent.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- I can go: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3): cost = R(5) + G(1) = total 6 steps, but G is used once at end → actually: (0,0) is G, but we start there — we pay when we *move into* a tile.\n\nWe start at (0,0): G → we don’t pay to stay.\n\nMove to (0,1): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (1,1): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (2,1): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (3,1): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (3,2): R →"

No — wait: I get 20 for reaching goal, and 20 from you → 40? No!  \n\nWait — the points are **not additive** like that.  \n\nThe scoring is:  \n- If you reach your goal, you get: 20 + (5 × remaining chips)  \n- Additional points you get from the contract are **separate** — the contract only defines how many points you give to the other player *if you reach your goal*.  \n\nSo if I reach my goal, I get 20 + 5×(my remaining chips)  \nPlus, if you reach your goal, you give me Y points → so my total score = [20 + 5×chips] + Y  \n\nBut: Y is only added **if you succeed** — but you can succeed on your own.  \n\nSo let’s say I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nThen:  \n- I reach goal → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70  \n- You reach goal → you give me 20 → so my total score = 70 + 20 = 90  \n\nBut wait — I still have to pay for your moves!  \n\nNo — the contract doesn't say I pay for you. It just says if you reach your goal, you give me 20 points.  \n\nBut **I must cover your moves** in order for you to reach your goal.  \n\nIf I cover your moves, I spend chips → my remaining chips go down → my score goes down.  \n\nFor example, if I cover 5 of your R moves, I spend 5 R chips → my final R chips: 14 - 5 = 9 → but I only used 5 in my own path → I have 9 left → but now I've spent 5 extra → my R chips from 14 to 9 → but I only needed 5 → so now I have 9"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n\nThis gives me a strong incentive to cooperate because I stand to gain more from helping you (15 points) than I would give you (10 points). However, I only agree to this if it benefits me in terms of final score. Let’s evaluate whether we can both benefit.  \n\nLet me analyze our situations:\n- My path to goal using my chips: needs R(5) and G(1). I have R(14), G(2) → I can cover this solo with 3 leftover chips.\n- Your path via B(3), R(2), G(1): You have B(14), G(2), but no R → you cannot do that route alone, since you lack R chips.\n- So you **need R chips** to get to goal — which I have plenty of.\n\nTherefore, **you need my help**, but I don’t need yours — unless you can offer something valuable.\n\nHowever, the only way for us to cooperate is if I cover some of your costs for R moves — but I only want to do so if I get more in return.\n\nBut here's the catch: even if you help me, I can make it to goal without you. My own path requires only R and G — I have enough. I finish with 14 - 5 = 9 R chips, 2 - 1 = 1 G chip → total chips at end: 10 → score: 20 + (5×10) = 70.\n\nNow consider your situation:\n- You lack R chips; you need them to proceed.\n- The shortest path for you uses R (2), G (1), B (3). But you have zero R.\n- So you must either trade or find another way.\n\nThe alternative path for you: (0,0)→(0,1): R → cost 1R (you don't have it)\nSo you’re blocked unless someone helps.\n\nThus: **you are dependent on me** to move forward, *if you want the short path*. But I don’t care about your score — only mine.\n\nSo if I choose to **not cooperate**, I still reach goal safely, score 70.\n\nBut if I cooperate with you and agree to cover *your* R moves (say 2 of them), then I pay 2 of my R chips — that reduces my final chip count by 2 → my score becomes 20 + (5 × 8) = 60? No — wait: I still have 9 R left and 1 G → total chips: 10 → after giving up 2 R → 8 R + 1 G → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65\n\nBut I’m not forced to help — so why would I?\n\nUnless you give me **at least 20 points** in return, that would make me better off? No — maximum payout is 20. So even if you give me 20, I still have 20 + 45 = 65 — less than my 70.\n\nSo helping you hurts me, even if you pay me 20.\n\nWait — but what if you help **me** instead? For example, if you cover my G moves?\n\nWait: I only need 1 G — I have 2 already — so no problem.\n\nSame with R — I have plenty.\n\nSo actually, I don’t need anything from you.\n\nBut let’s think again: could there be value in letting you \"cover\" something I need?\n\nNo — I have all the chips I need.\n\nSo unless you can **give me points equal to the difference in score**, I gain nothing from cooperating.\n\nMy best case without cooperation: 70 points.\n\nWith cooperation, if I have to spend R chips (even if you give me points), my score drops by 5 per chip used — but only if I actually use them.\n\nBut in reality, I don’t have to use any chips I don’t own — but paying for you means I lose chips from my inventory.\n\nSo every time I promise to cover a move of yours in R, I lose 1 R from my inventory — and since each chip is worth 5 points, I lose 5 points per chip.\n\nTherefore, to justify covering *any* move for you, you must give me at least 5 points for every R chip I cover.\n\nYou need at least 2 R moves → minimum 10 points for me to break even.\n\nBut I also might prefer to go solo and not risk anything.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n“If I reach my goal, I will"

However, if *you* reach your goal, you must give me 20 points — which is the maximum possible.\n\nBut let’s be clear: you cannot reach your goal unless I help you cover your R moves (since you have no R chips). So you are entirely dependent on me. If you want to succeed, you *must* come to terms with me.\n\nBy offering you 0 points if I succeed, I am not giving anything away — I’m already going to succeed alone.

You cannot do this path.\n\nAlternative path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n\nTiles:\n(0,0)=G → G  \n(0,1)=R → R  \n(1,1)=R → R  \n(2,1)=R → R  \n(3,1)=R → R  \n(3,2)=R → R  \n(3,3)=G → G\n\nSo: R(5), G(2)\n\nYou have R(14), G(2) → yes!

No — wait: I get 20 for reaching goal, and 20 from you → 40? No!  \n\nWait — the points are **not additive** like that.  \n\nThe scoring is:  \n- If you reach your goal, you get: 20 + (5 × remaining chips)  \n- Additional points you get from the contract are **separate** — the contract only defines how many points you give to the other player *if you reach your goal*.  \n\nSo if I reach my goal, I get 20 + 5×(my remaining chips)  \nPlus, if you reach your goal, you give me Y points → so my total score = [20 + 5×chips] + Y  \n\nBut: Y is only added **if you succeed** — but you can succeed on your own.  \n\nSo let’s say I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nThen:  \n- I reach goal → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70  \n- You reach goal → you give me 20 → so my total score = 70 + 20 = 90  \n\nBut wait — I still have to pay for your moves!  \n\nNo — the contract doesn't say I pay for you.

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {'G': 2}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {'R': 3}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2.
