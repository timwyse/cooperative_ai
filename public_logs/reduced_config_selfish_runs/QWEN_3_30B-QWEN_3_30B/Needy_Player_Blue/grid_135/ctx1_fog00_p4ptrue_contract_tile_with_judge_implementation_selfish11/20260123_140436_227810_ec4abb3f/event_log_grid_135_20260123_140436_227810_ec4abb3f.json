What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a R  \n(1, 1): You give me a R  \n(1, 2): You give me a R  \n(2, 2): You give me a R  \n(3, 2): You give me a R  \n\nThis covers the path: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nWhy this path?  \n- It uses 5 R chips, which I have plenty of (14 R), and only 1 G chip (at (3, 3)), which I can cover myself.  \n- The other player has 14 B, 2 G, 0 R. So they **don’t have R chips**, meaning **they will be unable to move on R tiles unless I help them**.  \n- But I **only need R chips** from them, and I have them in my inventory — so I can **benefit from this**.\n\nWait — actually, I made a mistake.\n\nI said I'm covering the other player's R moves — but **I don't have R chips needed by them**, and they don’t have R chips either. So that wouldn’t help them.\n\nWait — let's re-analyze.\n\nMy goal: (3, 3).  \nPath: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nTiles and colors:  \n- (1, 0): R  \n- (1, 1): R  \n- (1, 2): R  \n- (2, 2): R  \n- (3, 2): R  \n- (3, 3): G\n\nSo I need 5 R and 1 G.\n\nI have 14 R → enough for R tiles.  \nBut I have 0 G → I cannot pay for (3, 3).\n\nSo I **must get G from the other player**.\n\nBut the other player has 2 G.\n\nSo if I want to take this path, I must **get G covered**.\n\nOther valid path: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nTiles:  \n- (1, 0): R  \n- (2, 0): B  \n- (3, 0): B  \n- (3, 1): B  \n- (3, 2): R  \n- (3, 3): G\n\nSo I need: R: 2, B: 3, G: 1\n\nI have no B → I **cannot** pay for B tiles.\n\nSo I **must have B covered**.\n\nThe other player has 14 B → plenty.\n\nSo if I take this path, I can **get B covered by them**.\n\nNow, what about the other player?\n\nThey are at (0,0), goal (3,3).  \nTheir chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nSo they **lack R chips**.\n\nTheir possible path?  \n- (0,0): G  \n- (1,0): R → they have 0 R → can't pay  \n- (0,1): B → they have 14 B → ok  \n- (0,2): R → again, no R  \nSo they need R tiles, but have none.\n\nSo they need R covered.\n\nNow, I have 14 R, so I can cover their R moves.\n\nSo: mutual benefit.\n\nLet me map a path for them.\n\nThey need to get R tiles.\n\nBest path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,1): B → they have B → ok  \n- (0,2): R → need R covered → I can cover  \n- (0,3): R → need R covered  \n- (1,3): B → they can pay  \n- (2,3): B → they can pay  \n- (3,3): G → they can pay (have 2 G)\n\nSo they need R covered on (0,2) and (0,3)\n\nNow, what about me?\n\nIf I take the path (0,0) → (1, \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I propose the following contract:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a B  \n(2, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 1): You give me a B  \n(3, 2): You give me a R  \n(3, 3): You give me a G  \n\nThis covers my path: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nWhy this works for me:\n- I need 3 B (on (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)), 1 R (on (3,2)), and 1 G (on (3,3))\n- I have 0 B, 14 R, 2 G → I cannot pay for B tiles, so I must get B covered by you\n- I have 14 R → no issue with R\n- I have 2 G → I can cover the G tile at (3,3) and have 1 left over\n\nNow, why this works for you:\n- You are at (0,0), goal (3,3)\n- You have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R → you can only pay for B and G tiles\n- You cannot afford R tiles, so you need R covered\n- If I take the B path, I don’t pass through any R tiles, so you don’t need to cover me for R\n- Wait — actually, you need R tiles for your own path.\n\nLet’s reframe.\n\nI realize I made a mistake: I cannot assume you’ll use only B and G tiles. You must pass through R tiles to reach (3,3), and you have 0 R chips.\n\nSo your path must include R tiles that you cannot pay for.\n\nBest path for you: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B → you can pay (14 B)\n- (0,2): R → need R covered\n- (0,3): R → need R covered\n- (1,3): B → you can pay\n- (2,3): B → you can pay\n- (3,3): G → you can pay\n\nSo you need R covered on (0,2) and (0,3)\n\nNow, I have 14 R → I can cover those.\n\nNow, if I take the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 R → can pay\n- (2,0): B → I have 0 B → cannot pay → need B covered\n- (3,0): B → same\n- (3,1): B → same\n- (3,2): R → I can pay\n- (3,3): G → I can pay (2 G)\n\nSo I need B covered on (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)\n\nYou have 14 B → you can cover those.\n\nSo here’s the deal:\n\n- I will take the long path through B tiles (down the left side), and you take the path along the top (through R tiles)\n- I need B covered on (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)\n- You need R covered on (0,2), (0,3)\n\nSo here’s the proposed contract:\n\n(2, 0): I give you a B  \n(3, 0): I give you a B  \n(3, 1): I give you a B  \n(0, 2): You give me a R  \n(0, 3): You give me a R  \n\nWait — no, that's backwards.\n\nLet’s be precise.\n\nIn “pay for other” mode:\n- If I say “(2,0): You give me a B”, that means: when I move to (2,0), you pay the B cost for me.\n- Similarly, if you say “(0,2): I give you a R”, that means: when you move to (0,2), I pay the R cost for you.\n\nBut the other player must cover the cost for me on the tiles I move to.\n\nSo for my path:\n- I need B on (2,0 \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(2, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 1): You give me a B  \n(0, 2): You give me a R  \n(0, 3): You give me a R  \n\nThis means:\n- When I move to (2,0), (3,0), or (3,1), you pay the B cost for me.\n- When you move to (0,2) or (0,3), I pay the R cost for you.\n\nWhy this benefits **me**:\n\n- I take the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- I need to pay for: (1,0): R (I have 14 R → ok), (2,0): B (covered by you), (3,0): B (covered), (3,1): B (covered), (3,2): R (I have 14 R → ok), (3,3): G (I have 2 G → ok)\n- So I pay for no chips myself — all costs are covered by you where I need B.\n- After this path, I will have:\n  - Used: 5 R (for (1,0), (3,2)), 1 G (for (3,3)) → but I have 14 R, 2 G → so I will have 9 R and 1 G left.\n  - And I get to keep all the B chips you promised to cover me for: 3 B → but since you are covering them, I get to keep them in my inventory.\n- So my final chip count: 9 R + 1 G + 3 B (promised by you, not used) = 13 chips → 5 × 13 = 65 points from chips + 20 for goal = **85 total points**\n\nWhy this benefits **you**:\n\n- You take the path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- You need to pay: (0,1): B (you have 14 → ok), (0,2): R (covered by me), (0,3): R (covered), (1,3): B (you have 14 → ok), (2,3): B (ok), (3,3): G (you have 2 → ok)\n- So you pay for no chips — all R costs covered by me.\n- After path: you have 14 B – 3 used = 11 B, 2 G – 1 used = 1 G, and you get to keep 2 R that I promised (not used) → total chips: 11 B + 1 G + 2 R = 14 chips → 5 × 14 = 70 + 20 = 90 points.\n\nBut wait — you **do** benefit, but only if you can reach goal.\n\nCan you reach goal? Yes — with this path, no issue.\n\nBut do I strictly benefit more than if I refused?\n\nYes — if I didn’t cooperate:\n\n- My only path without help: I need R and G, but I have no B.\n- So I can't go down the left side unless B is covered.\n- So I must find another path — but all others go through B or R.\n- The only alternative I have is the upper path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3): 5 R, 1 G — I have 14 R, 2 G → I can pay for this path.\n- Then I use 5 R and 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → total 10 chips → 50 + 20 = 70 points.\n\nBut in this agreement, I get 13 chips (9 R, 1 G, 3 B) → 65 + 20 = 85 > 70.\n\nSo I **benefit** by cooperating.\n\nYou also benefit: you get 90 instead of possibly less.\n\nBut since I only care about **my own score**, and I get 85 > 70 (best alternative), I accept this.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n(2, 0): You give \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: (2, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 1): You give me a B  \n(0, 2): You give me a R  \n(0, 3): You give me a R  \n\nThis contract allows me to take the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), where I only pay for R and G tiles (which I have), and you cover the B costs on (2,0), (3,0), (3,1). I also get to keep the 3 B chips you promised, which I don't use.  \n\nFor you, I cover the R costs on (0,2) and (0,3), which you cannot pay for.  \n\nMy final chip count: 9 R + 1 G + 3 B = 13 chips → 5 × 13 = 65 + 20 = 85 points.  \nMy alternative without cooperation: 70 points.  \n\nSo I strictly benefit.  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",
