Last error: No JSON-like content found in response\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (2, 2), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is directly down to (3, 2), then right to (3, 3). However, moving from (2, 2) to (3, 2): this tile is R (Red). I currently have 0 Red chips in my inventory. Therefore, I cannot move onto (3, 2) unless the other player agrees to cover my Red chip cost for this move.\\n\\nLooking at the other player: they are at (3, 2), which is also R, and they have 9 Red chips. They are already very close to their goal at (3, 3)—they only need to move one step right, which is G (Green). Their Green chip count is 2, so they can afford that move.\\n\\nI consider whether a trade would help me: if I propose to cover their upcoming move to (3, 3) (which requires 1 Green chip), I could request they cover my move to (3, 2) (Red). But wait—their green chips are limited, and while I don’t need to use them now, I might want to save that leverage.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: if I **don’t move now**, I remain at (2,2) where I can *potentially* negotiate or plan a different route. However, my best option is actually a direct path:\\n- (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\nThis path requires 1 Red chip and 1 Green chip. I have no Red chips, but the other player has plenty of Red (9), and I have 2 Green chips. If I ask them to cover my 1 Red chip for moving to (3,2), they will have to pay it themselves when I step on a Red tile. Since they have many Red chips, they can afford it—for a limited number of moves.\\n\\nIf I agree to cover 1 Red move for them (e.g., if they need to go back through Red tiles later, not likely), then they might agree to cover my Red move.\\n\\nBut here’s the catch: if I stay at (2,2) and do nothing, I don’t get closer to my goal. To maximize my score, I must reach my goal. And without covering Red, I cannot make progress.\\n\\nSo I **must** initiate a trade to cover my Red chip cost for one move.\\n\\nProposal: Offer to cover up to 1 Red chip move for them (if needed in future), and request they cover MY 1 Red chip move to (3,2).\\n\\nThey have strong incentive to accept: they’re already at (3,2), close to goal. If I help them by covering their potential future needs, they may see value. But more importantly: since I **will** be covering their future Red moves (if any), they might cooperate.\\n\\nHowever, I must act now: if I delay, I’m still stuck with 0 Red chips.\\n\\nTherefore: I will attempt to move to (3,2) immediately via a trade. I propose: \\\"For 1 Red chip coverage for me, you cover me on 1 Red tile. In return, I’ll cover you on 1 Red tile (when you need it).\\\"\\n\\nBut the system does not ask for chat; we must just make a move if we can.\\n\\nCritical: The game allows us to move IF the other player promises to cover the required chip type.\\n\\nDo I have a promise from the other player to cover my Red move? No.\\n\\nCan I move? Only if I get that promise first.\\n\\nSo I **cannot move** yet unless I get their agreement.\\n\\nBut wait — I haven't proposed anything yet. So I should now **propose a trade**.\\n\\nThe instructions say: \\\"You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\\"\\n\\nI can use this turn to propose a trade to enable movement.\\n\\nThus, in this turn, I don’t move—but instead, I **propose** a trade that enables me to go forward later.\\n\\nHowever, the output format requires `want_to_move` and `move`, which implies an action on the board—moving or staying.\\n\\nSince I **cannot** move without a trade agreement, and I'm about to propose one, I should set `want_to_move` to false, and not move.\\n\\nBut the system won’t let me propose a trade explicitly without saying 'I propose' in reasoning.\\n\\nWait — the example"
