This means that when I move onto a tile requiring a red chip, they will pay it for me.\n\nThe first move along this path is to (1, 3), which is a B tile. I have 11 B chips — more than enough. So I can make this move safely, and still have plenty left.\n\nEven though the next move to (2, 3) requires a red chip, I am covered by the other player’s promise (they said they’d cover 1 R move). Therefore, I can proceed safely down this optimal path.\n\nAdditionally, the other player is at (3, 2), and their goal is also (3, 3). They are one step away from the goal. If I move toward the center path, it may even allow for potential coordination later, but since I only care about my own score and must strictly benefit from any cooperation, I note: I already have a valid agreement in place (they cover 1 R chip for me), so using it now maximizes my progress without risk.\n\nMoving to (1, 3) gets me closer to my goal with no cost to me beyond what's already accounted for via the trade. No alternative path offers better efficiency or safety. Therefore, this move is optimal.",

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 1, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 1)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 1)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips.

Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
