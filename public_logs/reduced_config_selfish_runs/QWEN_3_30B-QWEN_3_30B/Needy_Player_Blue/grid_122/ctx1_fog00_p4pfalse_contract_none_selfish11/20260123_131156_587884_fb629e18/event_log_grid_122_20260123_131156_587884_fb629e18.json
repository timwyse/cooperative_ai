                  "error": "Failed to get valid JSON response after 3 attempts. Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (3, 1), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is two steps: (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). The tile at (3,2) is red (R), and the tile at (3,3) is green (G). To move to (3,2), I need 1 red chip. I currently have 0 red chips, so I cannot make that move immediately. The tile at (3,3) is green (G), but even if I could somehow skip (3,2), I’d still need a green chip to enter it — and I have 0 green chips. My current inventory is {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}. Thus, I cannot proceed along the direct path without trading. However, the other player is already at (3,3), having finished the game. They have 3 green and 7 red chips. Since they are already done, they have no incentive to help me — but I might trade with them for chips. However, since I only care about my own score, I must evaluate: will trading improve my final score? If I can reach the goal with more chips than if I didn’t trade, then yes. But here’s the catch: if I don’t complete the goal, I get 0 points regardless of what I do. So, the critical point is whether I can reach the goal by any means, possibly using traded chips. I could propose to trade 1 blue chip for 1 green or 1 red chip from the other player, but they’ve already finished — and there’s no benefit for them to trade with me anymore, as their score is now fixed. But let's assess my best shot: if I trade 1 blue chip for 1 red chip from the other player (possible rate: 1B = 1R), I can use that to move to (3,2), then I’d need one green chip to enter (3,3). So I’d need to trade again for green. Alternatively, I could trade 1B for 1G — but would that be better? Suppose I propose: give 1B to get 1G. Then: after move to (3,2), I still need 1G to enter (3,3). With 1G in hand, I can finish. But if I do such trades, I will spend 2 B chips (1 for R, 1 for G), leaving me with 10B. Then after reaching goal: I’d get 20 + 5 * 10 = 70 points. But if I stay put and do nothing, I won’t reach goal — score is 0. So any trade that lets me reach goal is better than getting 0. The risk is that if they reject, I may be stuck. However, their chip distribution is {'B':0, 'G':3, 'R':7}, so they have plenty of G and R. I’m offering 1B for 1R or 1G — likely acceptable. But crucially: if I ask for 1R, I can go to (3,2), but then I’m still stuck at (3,2) needing G. Same with G. So I need **both** chips. Therefore, I need to propose two trades — or a single package deal. But since I can only propose one trade at a time, the safest bet is to first trade for a red chip: offer 1B to get 1R. Then I’ll be able to move to (3,2). Once at (3,2), I’ll still need a green chip. After that, I can propose another trade to get a green chip. But the problem is: I must first make a move — I can't trade during movement. So on this turn, I cannot move because I lack both R and G chips. But I can **propose a trade** to get one needed chip. However, in this JSON format, we are supposed to decide movement or not. The move decision is separate from the trade proposal. But according to instructions: 'if you cannot move, set want_to_move to false'. So if I cannot move due to missing chips, I should not move — even if I plan to trade later. Furthermore, if I stay put, I can attempt a trade. Since my goal is to maximize my score, and I can only get points if I reach (3,3), I must eventually trade. But I cannot move right now. So I must NOT move. And instead, I should plan to trade. So: I will not move this turn. I will stay at"
