So I cannot take this path without acquiring red chips first. Alternatively, I could consider moving toward the other player at (3,1), who has 10 red chips and 2 green chips. The path (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) is possible but requires B (2,0), R (3,0), R (3,1), R (3,2), G (3,3). That’s R:3, B:1, G:1. I have no red chips, so again, I can't move to (2,0) because (2,0) is B and I can afford that (I have 13 blue), but the move to (3,0) is R — which I don’t have. So that path is blocked too.
