My chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}.  \nOther player has: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} — they have no red chips, but I have 14 red.\n\nI can take the path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis path requires: R:5, G:1 — total 6 chips.  \nI have enough R (14) and G (2), so I can complete this path without trading.\n\nBut let’s check the other path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: B:4, R:1, G:1 — total 6 chips.  \nI have no B chips, so I must trade B with the other player.\n\nBut I have plenty of red, and they have no red. So I can’t get red from them.\n\nBut if I take the first path (using R and G), I never need B. And I have both R and G. So I can complete the path without any trade.\n\nDo I need to trade at all?\n\nLet’s verify:\n- (0,0): G → I have G:2 → pay 1 G → G:1\n- (0,1): R → I have R:14 → pay 1 R → R:13\n- (1,1): R → R:12\n- (2,1): R → R:11\n- (3,1): R → R:10\n- (3,2): R → R:9\n- (3,3): G → I have G:1 → pay 1 G → G:0\n\nSo I need:\n- 5 R chips\n- 1 G chip\nAnd I have: R:14, G:2 → sufficient.\n\nThus, I can reach goal without any trade.\n\nBut why would I want to trade?\n\nOnly if a trade leads to higher final score.\n\nBut I already have enough chips to complete the path without trade.\n\nFinal score if I complete this path:  \n20 + 5 × (remaining chips)  \nRemaining chips: R:9, G:0 → total 9 chips → score = 20 + 5×9 = 20 + 45 = 65\n\nCan I do better?\n\nSuppose I try to take a path that uses fewer chips? But all paths are 6 steps. No shortcut.\n\nBut if I trade, I might get more chips at the end? But only if I can free up more chips by avoiding cost.\n\nBut in this case, I don’t need to trade — I have all necessary chips.\n\nSo why trade?\n\nUnless the other player offers to give me chips in exchange for something, but I have no reason to give up my chips.\n\nBut perhaps I can propose a trade to **help the other player**, but only if *I* benefit.\n\nWait: If I help the other player, they might help me. But I must be strictly better off.\n\nLet’s look at their path.\n\nThey are at (0,0), goal (3,3). They have B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nThey lack red chips. So any path using red is expensive for them.\n\nPath 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles: (0,0):G, (0,1):R, (1,1):R, (2,1):R, (3,1):R, (3,2):R, (3,3):G  \nSo chips needed: R:5, G:1 → they have G:2, but R:0 → so they need 5 red chips.\n\nThey have no red — must get from me.\n\nBut I have red. So I can trade red to them.\n\nBut if I trade red to them, I lose red chips — which I currently have 14. But if I don’t trade, I get to keep 9 red and 0 green at the end.\n\nBut if I trade, I might get something in return.\n\nBut I have no need to trade — I can go without any trade.\n\nBut suppose \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach my goal without any trade, using the path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis path requires: 5 Red, 1 Green.  \nI have: 14 Red, 2 Green → sufficient.  \nAfter completing: I will have 9 Red, 0 Green → score = 20 + 5×9 = 65\n\nNow, consider if I cooperate with the other player.\n\nThey have no Red chips, but 14 Blue and 2 Green.  \nThey need to get to (3,3). Let’s find a path they can take.\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles: (0,0):G → (1,0):B → (2,0):B → (2,1):R → (2,2):B → (2,3):B → (3,3):G  \nChips needed: B:4, R:1, G:1\n\nThey have B:14, G:2, R:0 → so need 1 Red chip.\n\nThey can get 1 Red from me.\n\nIf I give them 1 Red chip at (2,1), they can make it.\n\nBut I must **gain strictly more** than 65 to want to help.\n\nCurrently, I get 65.\n\nIf I help them by giving 1 Red at (2,1), I will have 8 Red (instead of 9), so final score 20 + 5×8 = 60 → worse.\n\nSo I lose 5 points.\n\nThey might offer something in return — but I need to get more than 65.\n\nFor example, if they give me 2 Blue chips in return, I would have: Red:8, Blue:2 → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 50 = 70 → better.\n\nBut do they have anything to offer?\n\nThey have 14 Blue, 2 Green — but no Red.\n\nBut I have Red, which they need.\n\nSo they are willing to trade Red for Blue or Green.\n\nI don't care about Blue or Green — I only care about total chips at end.\n\nBut if I trade, I must be strictly better off.\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\nI help them reach their goal by giving them 1 Red chip at (2,1) — the only red tile on their needed path.\n\nBut I need them to give me something in return.\n\nLet’s see: if they give me 2 Blue chips and I give them 1 Red, then:\n\n- I go along the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n  - This path: B:4 (at (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3)), R:1 (at (2,1)), G:1 (at (3,3))\n  - But I don’t have B chips — only 14 Red and 2 Green.\n\nSo I need B chips.\n\nTherefore, I must trade for B chips.\n\nBut I can't get B chips unless they give them.\n\nSo in this case, if I take this path, I need to get B chips from them.\n\nThey have B:14.\n\nSo if I trade with them, I can get B chips.\n\nBut I need to be strictly better off.\n\nCurrent best without trade: 65.\n\nNow, try to find a trade that makes me better off.\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n- I will provide 1 Red chip to you at (2,1) so you can move to (2,1).\n- You will provide 2 Blue chips to me at (2,0) and (2,2), so I can traverse (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nBut I must be able to traverse the path.\n\nLet’s define a path where I use their B chips.\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): B → need B\n- (2,0): B → need B\n- (2,1): R → need R\n- ( \n, \nplayer 0: I do not need to trade. I have enough chips to reach my goal via the path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path requires 5 red and 1 green, which I fully have. After completion, I will have 9 red and 0 green, giving me 20 + 5×9 = 65 points.\n\nAny trade I make would require me to give up chips (e.g., red) to the other player, and in return receive something (e.g., blue), but I gain no benefit from blue chips — only total remaining chips matter. If I trade away red, I end with fewer chips, lowering my score. Even if they give me blue in return, unless the net chip count increases, I lose value.\n\nFor example, if I give 1 red and get 2 blue, I go from 9 red (65 points) to 8 red + 2 blue → 10 total chips → 20 + 50 = 70 → better. But only if I can complete the path using their chips at no cost to me.\n\nBut to use their blue chips, I must use a path that goes through blue tiles — for example: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3). This path requires 4 blue, 1 red, and 1 green. I have no blue, so I need their blue. But I must pay at each tile — so I need them to provide blue chips at (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nIf I propose a contract: I give them 1 red at (2,1), and they give me 4 blue at (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), then I can complete this path.\n\nMy chip flow:\n- Start: R:14, G:2\n- After trade: I give 1 R → R:13\n- Receive 4 B → B:4\n- Move: \n  - (1,0): B → paid from their supply → I keep B:4\n  - (2,0): B → paid → B:3\n  - (2,1): R → paid from my supply → R:12 (but I only have 12? Wait — I gave 1 red, so I have 13 left, pay 1 → 12)\n  - (2,2): B → paid → B:2\n  - (2,3): B → paid → B:1\n  - (3,3): G → I have G:2 → pay 1 → G:1\n\nFinal chips: R:12, G:1, B:1 → total: 14 chips → score: 20 + 5×14 = 20 + 70 = 90 → much better than 65!\n\nBut I also need to ensure the other player can reach their goal.\n\nThey were considering this same path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThey need: B:4, R:1, G:1\n\nThey have B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nThey need 1 red at (2,1) — I will give it.\n\nBut if I give them 1 red at (2,1), and I get 4 blue at (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), then they can complete the path.\n\nBut do they have any incentive?\n\nYes — because they can’t reach their goal without red.\n\nAnd I have red.\n\nBut now, if I give them 1 red, and they give me 4 blue, I gain 4 blue and lose 1 red → net +3 chips → more than before.\n\nAnd they gain 1 red and lose 4 blue → net -3 chips — but they still reach goal if they have enough.\n\nThey need 1 red and 4 blue and 1 green.\n\nThey have 14 blue, 2 green — after giving 4 blue, still have 10 blue — so can still do it.\n\nSo both of us can complete goal.\n\nNow, do I strictly benefit?\n\nWithout trade: 65\n\nWith this trade: I end with 12 red, 1 green, 1 blue → total 14 chips → 20 + 70 = 90 → yes, strictly better.\n\nBut wait — in this path, I move through (2,1), which requires R — I pay 1 red.\n\nBut I gave 1 red to them — but I need my own red to pay.\n\nSo I must give them 1 red at (2,1), but I also need to pay for myself.\n\nAh — problem.\n\nAt tile (2,1), I need to pay 1 red to move there.\n\nI have 14 red.\n\nBut if I give 1 red to them at (2,1), I must have it available.\n\nBut if I give it to them at that tile, they get it, I don't.\n\nSo I can't use that red for myself.\n\nSo to complete the path, I need to have red left.\n\nSo I cannot give 1 red to them *and* use 1 red for myself at the same tile.\n\nUnless the contract allows me to get the red from them at (2,1), but that means I don’t have to pay with my own red — but that’s not how it works.\n\nThe contract must specify which player provides the chip at each tile.\n\nSo if the contract says: at (2,1), I give you 1 red, then I must provide it.\n\nBut I need to pay 1 red to move to (2,1) — so I must have it.\n\nBut if I give it to them at the same time, I can’t use it.\n\nSo it’s impossible to give my red to them and still use it for myself.\n\nTherefore, I must have at least 2 red to do this: 1 for me to move to (2,1), and 1 to give to them.\n\nBut in this case, I do: I have 14 red — so I can give 1 red to them at (2,1) and still use 1 red to move there? No — I can’t use the same red twice.\n\nSo I need to provide red for both:\n\n- To move to (2,1) → I need a red at (2,1)\n- To give to them → I need to give a red at (2,1)\n\nSo two reds must be provided at (2,1): one for me, one for them.\n\nBut only one chip is played per tile per player.\n\nThe rule says: “Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.”\n\nSo when I move to (2,1), I must pay 1 red chip.\n\nIf I am to “give” a second red to them at (2,1), that means two reds are consumed at that tile: one by me (to move), one by them (if they are moving).\n\nBut they are not moving at (2,1) in my path.\n\nIn my path: I go (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1)\n\nSo only I am at (2,1).\n\nThe other player may not be at that tile.\n\nBut in the contract, we can define tile-by-tile responsibilities.\n\nSo at (2,1), I need to pay 1 red chip to move there.\n\nThe contract can say: at (2,1), you (other player) give me 1 red, so I don’t need to spend my own.\n\nBut then they are giving me red — which I need for me.\n\nBut they have no red.\n\nSo they can’t give.\n\nBut if the contract says at (2,1), I give them 1 red, then I must provide it.\n\nBut I also need to pay for moving.\n\nSo I can’t do both.\n\nUnless the contract allows the player to not have to pay if the other provides the chip.\n\nAh — that is the whole point of the contract.\n\nIn a contract, if a player is to move to a tile, and the contract says the other player provides the chip of that color at that tile, then the moving player does not need to pay.\n\nSo, for example, if the contract says: at (2,1), you (other player) give me a R chip, then I can move to (2,1) without spending my own R.\n\nBut they have no R — so they can’t.\n\nIf the contract says: at (2,1), I give you a R chip, then I must spend one R, but you (other player) are not moving there — so no benefit to them.\n\nSo the only way to exchange is if both players move to the tile.\n\nOtherwise, only one player uses the chip.\n\nSo for trade to happen at a tile, both players must use it — or one player pays and the other provides.\n\nBut they don't move to the same tile unless they both go there.\n\nIn this case, if we both go to (2,1), then we can trade at that tile.\n\nBut in my path, only I go to (2,1).\n\nIn their path, only they go to (2,1).\n\nSo we don’t both go there unless we coordinate movement.\n\nBut to make a contract, we can agree on a path where we both move through certain tiles, and agree who provides the chip at which tile.\n\nSo let’s propose a joint path alignment.\n\nI’ll go for the (2,1) route.\n\nWe both go through (2,1).\n\nBut do we both need to go through it?\n\nMy path: I go (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTheir path: they can go (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — but (3,1):R, (3,2):R, (3,3):G\n\nThey have no R — so they can't go there.\n\nSo they must go via (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nSo both of us can go: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThen both of us reach (3,3).\n\nNow, for each tile, who provides the chip.\n\n- (1,0): B — I have no B, they have 14 B — so they can provide.\n- (2,0): B — they can provide.\n- (2,1): R — I have 14 R, they have 0 — so I can provide.\n- (2,2): B — they can provide.\n- (2,3): B — they can provide.\n- (3,3): G — I have 2 G, they have 2 G — either can provide.\n\nBut I want to get blue from them, so I want them to provide the B chips.\n\nSo contract:\n\n- (1,0): You give me a B\n- (2,0): You give me a B\n- (2,2): You give me a B\n- (2,3): You give me a B\n- (2,1): I give you a R\n- (3,3): I give you a G  # or whatever\n\nBut at (2,1), I am providing red to them — so I must have it.\n\nAnd at (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), they provide blue — so I get blue without paying.\n\nAt (3,3), G — I can give them G.\n\nNow, chip flow:\n\nI start: R:14, G:2\n\nI receive 4 B from them at (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) — so I have B:4\n\nI give them 1 R at (2,1) — R:13\n\nI give them 1 G at (3,3) — G:1\n\nI don't pay for (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3) because they provide the chips.\n\nI pay for (2,1): I provide R — so R:13 →14? Wait\n\nI use my R for the move? But I give it to them.\n\nIf the contract says: at (2,1), I give you a R, then I provide it, and it's used to \"pay\" for my move.\n\nSo I don’t need a separate payment — the act of giving is the payment.\n\nSo I move to (2,1) using the chip I give.\n\nSimilarly, they provide blue for my move at other tiles.\n\nSo no cost to me for B tiles.\n\nAt (3,3), I give them G — so I pay for that move with G.\n\nAfter all:\n\n- I have: R:13 (gave 1), G:1 (gave 1), B:4 (received)\n- So total: 13 + 1 + 4 = 18 chips\n- Score: 20 + 5*18 = 20 + 90 = 110\n\nBut I used R:1, G:1, and got B:4 — net change: -1 -1 +4 = +2 chips\n\nBut I started with 16 chips (14+2), ended with 18.\n\nBut the contract is only for the tiles.\n\nNow, what about the other player?\n\nThey go same path.\n\nAt (1,0): B — I provide — so they get B from me\n\nSimilarly at (2,0): I provide B\n\nAt (2,1): R — I provide R to them — so they get R\n\nAt (2,2): B — I provide B\n\nAt (2,3): B — I provide B\n\nAt (3,3): G — I provide G? No, in the contract I said I give them G at (3,3), so I provide.\n\nBut they have G:2 — can they cover?\n\nThey need to move to (3,3), so they must pay G.\n\nIf I provide G at (3,3), then they don’t need to spend their own.\n\nBut in the contract, we said I give them G at (3,3), so they get it.\n\nBut then they don’t pay for themselves.\n\nBut they also need to pay for (2,3): B — I provide B, so they get it.\n\nSimilarly for (2,2), (2,0), (1,0)\n\nAt (2,1): R — I give, so they get it.\n\nSo all their moves are covered.\n\nThey have B:14, G:2 — they spend nothing, get nothing in return? They give R at (2,1)? No.\n\nWe said at (2,1): I give you R — so they receive.\n\nBut they have no R — so they can use it.\n\nThey spend: only at (3,3): G — but if I provide, they don’t spend.\n\nSo they spend no chips.\n\nBut they must pay for moving to each tile.\n\nIf I provide the chip, they don't need to pay.\n\nSo if I provide all the chips for the path, they don't spend anything.\n\nI am the one spending: I give R:1 and G:1 and B:4 (but I get B:4 from them).\n\nIn the contract:\n\n- (1,0): You give me B → I receive B\n- (2,0): You give me B → I receive B\n- (2,1): I give you R → I spend R:1\n- (2,2): You give me B → I receive B\n- (2,3): You give me B → I receive B\n- (3,3): I give you G → I spend G:1\n\nSo net:\n- I give: 1 R, 1 G\n- I receive: 4 B\n\nSo I have net +3 chips.\n\nBut I also use the B to \"move\" — but since I receive them, I don't spend.\n\nSo final inventory:\n- R:14 -1 = 13\n- G:2 -1 = 1\n- B:0 +4 = 4\n- Total: 18\n\nScore: 20 + 5*18 = 110\n\nBut I am not trading B away — I am receiving B.\n\nBut they give me B at 4 tiles.\n\nBut they have B:14 — can they afford it?\n\nYes.\n\nBut do they get anything back? Not yet.\n\nThey can get R and G from me.\n\nBut in this contract, I give them R:1 and G:1.\n\nSo they receive 1 R and 1 G.\n\nThey have B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nAfter trade: R:1, G:3, B:14 — but they don't spend anything — they use my chips.\n\nSo final chips: 1+3+14 = 18 — score 20 + 90 = 110\n\nSo both of us get 110 points.\n\nBut I started with 65 without trade, now I get 110 — better.\n\nAnd they also benefit.\n\nBut they are selfish too.\n\nBut I only care about my score.\n\nAnd I am strictly better off.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\nLet's both take the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nAgree to this contract:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(2,1): I give you a R  \n(2,2): You give me a B  \n(2,3): You give me a B  \n(3,3): I give you a G\n\nWith this, I will have 18 chips at the end (13 R, 1 G, 4 B), score 110 > 65.\n\nI am better off.\n\nSo I can do it.\n\nBut do they have to accept?\n\nThey have no choice but to accept if they want to go.\n\nBut they might not be \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I can achieve a significantly higher score by negotiating a contract that allows me to use the other player's blue chips while providing them with red and green chips in return. Currently, without trade, I would reach my goal with 9 red chips, scoring 65. However, by coordinating a joint path, I can increase my final chip count.\n\nProposed shared path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThis path requires: 4 blue (at (1,0), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3)), 1 red (at (2,1)), 1 green (at (3,3))\n\nI have no blue chips but 14 red and 2 green. The other player has 14 blue and 2 green but no red.\n\nI will propose the following contract to ensure I obtain the blue chips from them:\n- (1,0): You give me a B  \n- (2,0): You give me a B  \n- (2,1): I give you a R  \n- (2,2): You give me a B  \n- (2,3): You give me a B  \n- (3,3): I give you a G\n\nUnder this contract:\n- I receive 4 blue chips (no cost to me)\n- I give 1 red and 1 green chip\n- I use my own red to cover movement at (2,1), and my green at (3,3)\n- Final inventory: 13 red, 1 green, 4 blue → 18 chips\n- Final score: 20 + 5×18 = 110\n\nThis is strictly better than the 65 I get without trade.\n\nThe other player can also complete the path: they receive 1 red and 1 green from me, and spend no chips themselves (all are provided by me), so they also reach goal with 18 chips (1 red, 3 green, 14 blue) for 110 points.\n\nSince I benefit strictly from this contract (110 > 65), I will proceed.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(2,1): I give you a R  \n(2,2): You give me a B  \n(2,3): You give me a B  \n(3,3): I give you a G\n\nagree \n",
