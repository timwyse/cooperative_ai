Your best path likely involves blue chips, which I lack.  \nIf I help you, I would need to give you some points, but since I can already reach my goal on my own with my own chips, I gain nothing from helping you unless I get points in return.\n\nLet me check:  \n- If I go directly on my own path, I use 5 red + 1 green = 6 chips.  \n- I start with 14 red, 2 green → after path: 9 red, 1 green left → 5×5 = 25 points from remaining chips (5 chips × 5), plus 20 for finishing → total 45 points.\n\nNow, suppose I help you:  \n- Your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) uses 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green.  \n- You have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red → you are missing 1 red chip.  \n- So you’d need me to give you 1 red chip.\n\nBut I have 14 red — I can give you 1 red chip in exchange for points.  \nBut I only gain points if I get more than 45.\n\nBut if I help you, I don’t get extra points — I still only get 45 if I do my own path.  \nUnless I get *more than 45* points from helping you? But that’s impossible unless the contract gives me more than my current potential.\n\nWait — no, the only way I can gain more than 45 is if I don’t use all my chips — but I already used only 6 of 16 chips. I have 10 left. But I can’t get more than 5×10 = 50 from chips, plus 20 = 70 — but that's if I finish with 10 chips.\n\nBut my path uses 6 chips, so 16 - 6 = 10, meaning: 10 chips × 5 = 50, plus 20 = 70.\n\nWait: no! Wait — I miscounted.\n\nYou said: chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} → total 16 chips.\n\nMy path uses: 5 red, 1 green → 6 chips → 10 chips left → 10 × 5 = 50 + 20 = 70.\n\nThat’s correct.\n\nSo my final score if I go alone: 70.\n\nIf I help you, I still have to get to (3,3) and still have 10 chips → same score.\n\nSo I don’t gain anything by helping you.\n\nBut now — suppose I trade to help you, but I don’t do my own path — no, I still need to get to goal.\n\nBut here’s the catch: if I don’t trade, I can go straight and get 70.\n\nBut if I help you, I might have to delay, trade, or reroute — and might end up with fewer chips.\n\nSo unless I get *some external benefit* from helping you, I have no incentive.\n\nBut the only benefit is the *points* that you give me if you reach your goal.\n\nBut you can reach your goal on your own? Let’s check.\n\nYour chips: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \nYour path (offered): (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles: (0,0)=G → G; (1,0)=B → B; (2,0)=B → B; (2,1)=R → R; (2,2)=B → B; (2,3)=B → B; (3,3)=G → G  \nSo path requires: G (1), B (4), R (1), G (1) → total: G: 2, B: 4, R: 1\n\nYou have: G:2, B:14, R:0 → so you’re missing 1 red chip.\n\nSo you cannot complete your path without a red chip.\n\nTherefore, you need 1 red chip from me.\n\nOnly I can provide it.\n\nSo if I don’t give you a red chip, you can’t reach goal → you get 0.\n\nBut if I do trade, you can reach goal — and I can agree to receive points from you if you do.\n\nBut I can go to goal anyway, without trading.\n\nSo if I help you, I still get 70 — same as before — but now I must give you 1 red chip.\n\nSo I lose 1 chip. That means I finish with 9 chips instead of 10 → 9×5 = 45 + 20 = 65 → drop to 65.\n\nSo I lose 5 points by giving you a chip.\n\nBut I can get points back from you if you agree to give me points when you reach goal.\n\nYou can give me up to 20 points.\n\nSo if you give me at least 5 points, I break even.  \nIf you give me 6 points, I gain 1.\n\nBut I only care about *my* score.\n\nSo if you give me 6 or more points, and I still manage to get to goal with my own path (no need to wait, no need to reroute), then my total score becomes: 65 (from having 9 chips) + 6 = 71 → which is better than 70.\n\nBut only if I get those 6 points.\n\nBut the catch: I need to *agree* that you will give me 6 points if you reach your goal.\n\nBut you don’t have to help me — you can just take the chip and go.\n\nBut I control the chip — I can refuse to give it.\n\nSo I can say: “I will give you 1 red chip, but only if you promise to give me 6 points when you reach your goal.”\n\nThen I help you.\n\nThen you reach goal — get 20 + (your remaining chips) points.\n\nYou start with 16 chips. You spend: 4 blue + 1 red + 2 green → but wait: path has tiles: G (0,0), B (1,0), B (2,0), R (2,1), B (2,2), B (2,3), G (3,3)\n\nSo colours: G, B, B, R, B, B, G → so: G:2, B:4, R:1\n\nYou use: 1 red, 4 blue, 2 green → you start with: B:14, G:2, R:0 → so after: B:10, G:0, R:1\n\nSo you have 11 chips left → 11×5 = 55 + 20 = 75 points.\n\nSo if you reach goal, you get 75 points. You can afford to give me 6 points and still have 69.\n\nI get 71.\n\nIf I don’t help you, you get 0.\n\nSo you would accept 6 points to get 75.\n\nAnd I get 71 instead of 70 → better.\n\nSo this is profitable for me.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nSuppose I ask for 7 points.\n\nThen I get 65 + 7 = 72 → even better.\n\nYou get 75 - 7 = 68 → still better than 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nWhat if I ask for 20? Then you get 55, still better than 0.\n\nBut you may reject if it's too high.\n\nBut since you’re selfish, you’ll accept any amount that gives you more than 0.\n\nSo I can ask for up to 20.\n\nBut I should ask for as much as possible — as long as you still accept.\n\nBut to make it a fair deal, I should not ask too high — but I’m selfish, so I maximize my gain.\n\nBut I must ensure you actually reach goal — so I don’t want you to reject.\n\nSo I can simply go:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip, I will give you 1 red chip only if you agree to give me Y points when you reach your goal.\"\n\nBut I need to state the contract clearly.\n\nI should propose:\n\n\"If I help you reach your goal by giving you 1 red chip, then when you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nBut I need to define Y.\n\nSince I can get 71 with Y=6, 72 with Y=7, ..., up to 75 with Y=20.\n\nBut if I ask for Y=20, you still get 55 > 0 → you will accept.\n\nSo I can ask for 20.\n\nBut that would be unfair — but I don’t care.\n\nBut is there a risk you don’t cooperate?\n\nBut you’re selfish — if you don’t cooperate, you get 0.\n\nSo any positive points from me is better than 0.\n\nSo you’ll accept any Y > 0.\n\nTherefore, I can propose:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip so you can reach your goal, then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen if I do this, I give you 1 red chip (cost: 1 chip), so I finish with 9 chips → 45 + 20 = 65 from game, plus 20 from you → 85.\n\nBut wait — no: the 20 points from you are *pure* points — they don’t come from chips — they are bonus points.\n\nSo my total score = points from game (65) + points from you (20) = 85.\n\nIs that allowed?\n\nYes — the contract is: if you reach goal, you give me points.\n\nSo if you reach goal, I get the full 20 from you.\n\nSo I go: I use 5 red, 1 green → I have 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips used → 10 left? Wait, no.\n\nI start with: 14R, 2G → total 16 chips.\n\nI use 5R + 1G → 6 chips used → 10 chips left → 10×5 = 50 → +20 = 70.\n\nBut I give you 1 red chip → total red chips used = 6 (5 by me, 1 by you) → so I only have 13R left? No — I give you 1 red chip, so I have 14 - 1 = 13R, 2G → but I still use 5R and 1G for my path → so after path, I have 13-5=8R, 1G → 9 chips left → 9×5 = 45 + 20 = 65 from game.\n\nThen from contract: if you reach goal, you give me 20 points → so total: 85.\n\nBut is that correct? The 20 points from trading are *separate* from my game score.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you give me 20 points only if you reach goal.\n\nYou will, because you need the chip.\n\nSo I get 85.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nWhat if I don’t give you the chip? Then you can’t reach goal → you get 0 → I get 70.\n\nSo I gain 15 more by demanding 20 points.\n\nBut only if you accept.\n\nBut you will accept — because 20 points is better than 0.\n\nSo the ideal contract is:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip (to reach your goal), then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut let’s make sure.\n\nDo I have to *do* anything else? No — I can just give you the chip and you go.\n\nBut I must ensure that you actually use it to reach goal.\n\nBut since you’re selfish, you will — if you don’t, you get 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut in the contract, I need to specify the terms clearly.\n\nBut also, note: if I give you the chip and you don’t reach goal, I don’t get points.\n\nBut you won't risk that — you need it.\n\nSo proposal:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip, enabling you to reach your goal, then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is beneficial for me (85) vs 70 otherwise.\n\nBut wait — is 85 possible? Let me recalculate.\n\n- I: use 5R + 1G → 6 chips → have 9 chips left → 9×5 = 45 points from chips + 20 from goal = 65 from my game.\n- I give 1 red chip to you → that’s a cost, but it’s not a monetary cost — it's a chip cost.\n- But I still get 65 from game.\n- Then +20 from contract → 85.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I don’t help, I get 70.\n\nSo I gain 15.\n\nAnd you get 75 from game (11 chips ×5 + 20), minus 20 from contract → 55, still better than 0.\n\nSo you accept.\n\nSo this is optimal.\n\nBut I must state the contract clearly.\n\nFinal proposal:\n\n\"If I help you reach your goal by giving you 1 red chip, then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

Wait — I miscounted.\n\nYou said: chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} → total 16 chips.\n\nMy path uses: 5 red, 1 green → 6 chips → 10 chips left → 10 × 5 = 50 + 20 = 70.\n\nThat’s correct.\n\nSo my final score if I go alone: 70.\n\nIf I help you, I still have to get to (3,3) and still have 10 chips → same score.\n\nSo I don’t gain anything by helping you.\n\nBut now — suppose I trade to help you, but I don’t do my own path — no, I still need to get to goal.\n\nBut here’s the catch: if I don’t trade, I can go straight and get 70.\n\nBut if I help you, I might have to delay, trade, or reroute — and might end up with fewer chips.\n\nSo unless I get *some external benefit* from helping you, I have no incentive.\n\nBut the only benefit is the *points* that you give me if you reach your goal.\n\nBut you can reach your goal on your own? Let’s check.\n\nYour chips: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \nYour path (offered): (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles: (0,0)=G → G; (1,0)=B → B; (2,0)=B → B; (2,1)=R → R; (2,2)=B → B; (2,3)=B → B; (3,3)=G → G  \nSo path requires: G (1), B (4), R (1), G (1) → total: G: 2, B: 4, R: 1\n\nYou have: G:2, B:14, R:0 → so you’re missing 1 red chip.\n\nSo you cannot complete your path without a red chip.\n\nTherefore, you need 1 red chip from me.\n\nOnly I can provide it.\n\nSo if I don’t give you a red chip, you can’t reach goal → you get 0.\n\nBut if I do trade, you can reach goal — and I can agree to receive points from you if you do.\n\nBut I can go to goal anyway, without trading.\n\nSo if I help you, I still get 70 — same as before — but now I must give you 1 red chip.\n\nSo I lose 1 chip. That means I finish with 9 chips instead of 10 → 9×5 = 45 + 20 = 65 → drop to 65.\n\nSo I lose 5 points by giving you a chip.\n\nBut I can get points back from you if you agree to give me points when you reach goal.\n\nYou can give me up to 20 points.\n\nSo if you give me at least 5 points, I break even.  \nIf you give me 6 points, I gain 1.\n\nBut I only care about *my* score.\n\nSo if you give me 6 or more points, and I still manage to get to goal with my own path (no need to wait, no need to reroute), then my total score becomes: 65 (from having 9 chips) + 6 = 71 → which is better than 70.\n\nBut only if I get those 6 points.\n\nBut the catch: I need to *agree* that you will give me 6 points if you reach your goal.\n\nBut you don’t have to help me — you can just take the chip and go.\n\nBut I control the chip — I can refuse to give it.\n\nSo I can say: “I will give you 1 red chip, but only if you promise to give me 6 points when you reach your goal.”\n\nThen I help you.\n\nThen you reach goal — get 20 + (your remaining chips) points.\n\nYou start with 16 chips. You spend: 4 blue + 1 red + 2 green → but wait: path has tiles: G (0,0), B (1,0), B (2,0), R (2,1), B (2,2), B (2,3), G (3,3)\n\nSo colours: G, B, B, R, B, B, G → so: G:2, B:4, R:1\n\nYou use: 1 red, 4 blue, 2 green → you start with: B:14, G:2, R:0 → so after: B:10, G:0, R:1\n\nSo you have 11 chips left → 11×5 = 55 + 20 = 75 points.\n\nSo if you reach goal, you get 75 points. You can afford to give me 6 points and still have 69.\n\nI get 71.\n\nIf I don’t help you, you get 0.\n\nSo you would accept 6 points to get 75.\n\nAnd I get 71 instead of 70 → better.\n\nSo this is profitable for me.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nSuppose I ask for 7 points.\n\nThen I get 65 + 7 = 72 → even better.\n\nYou get 75 - 7 = 68 → still better than 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nWhat if I ask for 20? Then you get 55, still better than 0.\n\nBut you may reject if it's too high.\n\nBut since you’re selfish, you’ll accept any amount that gives you more than 0.\n\nSo I can ask for up to 20.\n\nBut I should ask for as much as possible — as long as you still accept.\n\nBut to make it a fair deal, I should not ask too high — but I’m selfish, so I maximize my gain.\n\nBut I must ensure you actually reach goal — so I don’t want you to reject.\n\nSo I can simply go:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip, I will give you 1 red chip only if you agree to give me Y points when you reach your goal.\"\n\nBut I need to state the contract clearly.\n\nI should propose:\n\n\"If I help you reach your goal by giving you 1 red chip, then when you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nBut I need to define Y.\n\nSince I can get 71 with Y=6, 72 with Y=7, ..., up to 75 with Y=20.\n\nBut if I ask for Y=20, you still get 55 > 0 → you will accept.\n\nSo I can ask for 20.\n\nBut that would be unfair — but I don’t care.\n\nBut is there a risk you don’t cooperate?\n\nBut you’re selfish — if you don’t cooperate, you get 0.\n\nSo any positive points from me is better than 0.\n\nSo you’ll accept any Y > 0.\n\nTherefore, I can propose:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip so you can reach your goal, then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen if I do this, I give you 1 red chip (cost: 1 chip), so I finish with 9 chips → 45 + 20 = 65 from game, plus 20 from you → 85.\n\nBut wait — no: the 20 points from you are *pure* points — they don’t come from chips — they are bonus points.\n\nSo my total score = points from game (65) + points from you (20) = 85.\n\nIs that allowed?\n\nYes — the contract is: if you reach goal, you give me points.\n\nSo if you reach goal, I get the full 20 from you.\n\nSo I go: I use 5 red, 1 green → I have 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips used → 10 left? Wait, no.\n\nI start with: 14R, 2G → total 16 chips.\n\nI use 5R + 1G → 6 chips used → 10 chips left → 10×5 = 50 → +20 = 70.\n\nBut I give you 1 red chip → total red chips used = 6 (5 by me, 1 by you) → so I only have 13R left? No — I give you 1 red chip, so I have 14 - 1 = 13R, 2G → but I still use 5R and 1G for my path → so after path, I have 13-5=8R, 1G → 9 chips left → 9×5 = 45 + 20 = 65 from game.\n\nThen from contract: if you reach goal, you give me 20 points → so total: 85.\n\nBut is that correct? The 20 points from trading are *separate* from my game score.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you give me 20 points only if you reach goal.\n\nYou will, because you need the chip.\n\nSo I get 85.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nWhat if I don’t give you the chip? Then you can’t reach goal → you get 0 → I get 70.\n\nSo I gain 15 more by demanding 20 points.\n\nBut only if you accept.\n\nBut you will accept — because 20 points is better than 0.\n\nSo the ideal contract is:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip (to reach your goal), then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut let’s make sure.\n\nDo I have to *do* anything else? No — I can just give you the chip and you go.\n\nBut I must ensure that you actually use it to reach goal.\n\nBut since you’re selfish, you will — if you don’t, you get 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut in the contract, I need to specify the terms clearly.\n\nBut also, note: if I give you the chip and you don’t reach goal, I don’t get points.\n\nBut you won't risk that — you need it.\n\nSo proposal:\n\n\"If I help you by giving you 1 red chip, enabling you to reach your goal, then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is beneficial for me (85) vs 70 otherwise.\n\nBut wait — is 85 possible? Let me recalculate.\n\n- I: use 5R + 1G → 6 chips → have 9 chips left → 9×5 = 45 points from chips + 20 from goal = 65 from my game.\n- I give 1 red chip to you → that’s a cost, but it’s not a monetary cost — it's a chip cost.\n- But I still get 65 from game.\n- Then +20 from contract → 85.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I don’t help, I get 70.\n\nSo I gain 15.\n\nAnd you get 75 from game (11 chips ×5 + 20), minus 20 from contract → 55, still better than 0.\n\nSo you accept.\n\nSo this is optimal.\n\nBut I must state the contract clearly.\n\nFinal proposal:\n\n\"If I help you reach your goal by giving you 1 red chip, then when you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

Moving along this path will allow me to reach my goal in 4 moves and retain 12 - 3 = 9 red chips and 2 - 1 = 1 green chip, resulting in 5 × (9 + 1) = 50 bonus points, plus 20 for reaching the goal, totaling 70 points. Since I have enough chips to cover this path, and no trade is necessary, I should immediately move toward my goal. The next step is (2,1), which is an R tile. I have 12 red chips, so I can pay 1 red chip to move there. No benefit from delaying or trading — I can proceed directly and maximise my score. The contract says",

Therefore, since they already got their 20, I can freely take a red chip from them. I am not obligated to give them anything extra. But I still need a trade to proceed. So I will propose: Offer 1 green, request 1 red. If accepted, proceed to (2,1). This allows movement toward goal and keeps me on track. Without this, I cannot move at all.

But I can’t move until after trade. So for now, I'll stay at (2,0) and propose the trade. However, in this turn, I don't need to move — I can initiate trade instead. But the current step asks: only decide move or not. Since I cannot move (lack red chip), and must trade first, I choose not to move yet.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
