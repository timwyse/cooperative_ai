This path requires moving onto two tiles: (3, 2) and (3, 3). From the board layout: (3, 2) is R (red), and (3, 3) is G (green). Therefore, to complete this path, I need 1 red chip for (3, 2) and 1 green chip for (3, 3). I currently have: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11} — so I have enough red and green chips to cover the entire path. Since I can afford both moves sequentially (no need to trade), I should proceed along this direct path. Moving to (3, 2) now costs 1 red chip, which I have. After that, I’ll be at (3, 2), then move to (3, 3) on the next turn, spending 1 green chip. This gives me a guaranteed path to the goal with minimal risk. Even though I could consider alternative paths involving blue (like going through (2,2)), those would require black chips, which I don’t have and where the other player has a surplus. However, since I don’t need to trade, and the direct path is available, I should take it. Staying or trying to trade now would delay progress unnecessarily. My total possible score would be 20 + 5 * (remaining chips after movement). If I use 1 red and 1 green from this path, I end with 10 red and 1 green → 5*11 = 55, plus 20 = 75.
