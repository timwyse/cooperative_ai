Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Can you offer me a better deal?\n\nLet’s suppose we agree:  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me X points.  \n- If I reach my goal, I don't give anything (since I don’t need your help).\n\nBut currently, if I do nothing, I get 70.\n\nIf I help you, I lose red chips → less final chips → lower score → unless you pay me more than the loss.\n\nBut even if you give me 20 points, my final score would be:  \n- After moving myself: 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70  \n- Plus 20 from you → **90 points**  \nWait — but how? I still have only 10 chips after my own movement.\n\nBut if I help you, I must spend one red chip on you → so I have only 9 red instead of 10 → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65\n\nThen add 20 from you → total 85\n\nBut 85 > 70 → so **only if you give me 20 points** can I be *strictly better off* by helping you.\n\nSo if you promise me 20 points if I help you reach your goal, then:\n\n- My final score: 65 (my chips) + 20 = 85\n- Your final score: 80 (as calculated earlier)\n\nThis benefits me: 85 > 70\n\nAnd I only help because it strictly improves my outcome.\n\nYou benefit too: you get 80 instead of 0.\n\nBut I only care about my score — so I accept only if I gain >70.\n\nSo contract proposal:\n\n\"If I help you reach your goal, I will receive 20 points from you.\nIf you help me reach my goal, you will receive 0 points.\"\n\nBut I don’t need your help — but you might want to barter for red chips.\n\nBut I can just say: I will help you only if you give me 20 points upon reaching your goal.\n\nBecause otherwise, I lose out.\n\nIs there any other way? What if I give you more red chips in exchange for more points?\n\nSuppose I give you 1 red chip for 20 points → I get 85\n\nBut if I keep all my reds and go solo: 70\n\nSo 85 > 70 → yes, I gain.\n\nBut 20 is maximum possible.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nOnly then do I benefit.\n\nBut I should not propose anything else — because I don't want to pay.\n\nWe can also think: Can I get you to give me more than 20? No — max is 20.\n\nSo I must require exactly 20.\n\nBut if you refuse, I stay at 70.\n\nSo:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\n**agree**"

I lack 1 red chip and have no red chips in inventory. However, there exists an alternative path: (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which costs R:1, B:2, G:1 — still missing 1 red. But the other player has 9 red chips and is at (2,3). A direct move from (2,3) to (3,3) only requires 1 green chip, which I have. If I move to (3,3) via (2,3) → (3,3), I would need to be at (2,3), but I’m not. My current position is (0,2). The only way to reach (3,3) directly from my location is via a longer path that demands red chips I don’t have. However, if I trade for 1 red chip from the other player, I can use the short path and complete in 4 moves. Since I have excess blue (12) and green (2), and the other player has 9 red, trading 2 blue for 1 red is beneficial: it allows me to take the optimal path without risk. After this trade, I would have R:1, B:10, G:2, enough to cover the required 1R + 2B + 1G. This yields a total of 20 (completion) + 5×(1+10+2)= 20+65=85 points.
