This path requires chips: 1 red, 3 blue, and 1 green. I currently have 13 blue, 2 green, and 0 red. The first tile to move to is (1,1), which is blue. I have 13 blue chips, so I can afford the cost of 1 blue chip to move there. After moving, I will still have 12 blue chips. The path remains viable, and I will not be blocked by chip shortage on this next step. The other player is at (1,3), which is far from my path, so they are unlikely to interfere. I have no immediate need to trade, as I can proceed with my current chips. The alternative path via (2,3) → (3,3) requires a green chip, which I do have (2 available), but it’s only 1 step long. However, that path would require me to move from (0,1) to (2,3) first, which is not adjacent and would take 3 extra steps. Since I can move directly to (1,1) and still have all necessary chips for the initial segment,",
