To reach (1,1), I must move via (1,0) or (0,1). (1,0) is red, (0,1) is blue. Moving to (0,1) would require a blue chip — I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford it.\\n\\nBut wait: the other path listed as 'prioritizing tiles the other player has' is: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] — but I’m not on that path yet. That path goes through red and green tiles, which I don’t have. However, the other player has plenty of red (12) and only 2 green. They need blue and green to move, but they are starting from (1,1) — which is red, and they paid for that already.\\n\\nNow, consider my current move: from (0,0). The adjacent tiles are:\\n- (1,0): color R (red) → I have 0 red chips → cannot afford to move there.\\n- (0,1): color B (blue) → I have 14 blue chips → can afford this.\\n\\nSo I can only move safely to (0,1) right now. From (0,1), next step could be (0,2), also blue — still safe. Then (0,3), blue. Then down to (1,3), which is red — again, I don't have red chips.\\n\\nAlternatively, after (0,1), go down to (1,1): tile is red. But I have no red chips — I cannot pay for that move unless I trade with the other player.\\n\\nBut — here's a key idea: if I move to (0,1), I get closer to the board center, and I have blue chips. The other player is at (1,0) and has many red chips. They might be willing to trade red for blue, but I can’t commit to a plan unless I know the trade rate.\\n\\nHowever, notice: the suggested path using the other player's inventory is shorter (only 4 steps from their current position). They’re already in a strong position to take it — but if they do, they’ll likely get to (3,3) quickly, and might block me or deplete red tiles.\\n\\nMy best move now is to move to (0,1), which is affordable (blue chip cost = 1), and gives me access to a row where I can possibly move later to (1,1) if I trade for red chips. By moving to (0,1), I stay on the edge, preserve my blue chips, and keep options open.\\n\\nAlso, if I stay at (0,0), I risk being blocked later by the other player moving into (1,0) and preventing me from moving down that path. So acting now is better.\\n\\nThus: I move to (0,1), spend 1 blue chip. I have 14 blue chips → 13 left. This move is safe, progresses me toward potential future trades, and does not require red chips. It sets up the possibility of negotiating a red-for-blue trade later, especially since I may need red tiles further down (e.g., (1,1) or (3,1)).\\n\\nFinal decision: Yes, I should move.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"0,1\"\n}",

That path goes through red and green tiles, which I don’t have. However, the other player has plenty of red (12) and only 2 green. They need blue and green to move, but they are starting from (1,1) — which is red, and they paid for that already.\n\nNow, consider my current move: from (0,0). The adjacent tiles are:\n- (1,0): color R (red) → I have 0 red chips → cannot afford to move there.\n- (0,1): color B (blue) → I have 14 blue chips → can afford this.\n\nSo I can only move safely to (0,1) right now. From (0,1), next step could be (0,2), also blue — still safe. Then (0,3), blue. Then down to (1,3), which is red — again, I don't have red chips.\n\nAlternatively, after (0,1), go down to (1,1): tile is red. But I have no red chips — I cannot pay for that move unless I trade with the other player.\n\nBut — here's a key idea: if I move to (0,1), I get closer to the board center, and I have blue chips. The other player is at (1,0) and has many red chips. They might be willing to trade red for blue, but I can’t commit to a plan unless I know the trade rate.\n\nHowever, notice: the suggested path using the other player's inventory is shorter (only 4 steps from their current position). They’re already in a strong position to take it — but if they do, they’ll likely get to (3,3) quickly, and might block me or deplete red tiles.\n\nMy best move now is to move to (0,1), which is affordable (blue chip cost = 1), and gives me access to a row where I can possibly move later to (1,1) if I trade for red chips. By moving to (0,1), I stay on the edge, preserve my blue chips, and keep options open.\n\nAlso, if I stay at (0,0), I risk being blocked later by the other player moving into (1,0) and preventing me from moving down that path. So acting now is better.\n\nThus: I move to (0,1), spend 1 blue chip. I have 14 blue chips → 13 left. This move is safe, progresses me toward potential future trades, and does not require red chips. It sets up the possibility of negotiating a red-for-blue trade later, especially since I may need red tiles further down (e.g., (1,1) or (3,1)).\n\nFinal decision: Yes, I should move.",

However, the other player has no red chips (they have R: 0), while I have 11 red chips. They also have 12 blue chips.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.
