The shortest path to the goal is 3 moves: (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), but that requires 2 red chips (on (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — wait, let's correct: (1,1) is R, (2,1) is B, (3,1) is B, (3,2) is R — so this path requires 2 red and 2 blue chips. However, I currently have 0 red and 13 blue, 2 green — so I lack red chips. I cannot move directly to (1,1) because it’s red, and I have no red chips. Similarly, (0,2) is red — also impossible. The only safe adjacent move from (0,1) is (0,0), which is green (G). (0,0) is green, and I have 2 green chips, so I can afford it. Moving to (0,0) would allow me to stay on a green tile and avoid red or blue costs — but it doesn’t move me closer to the goal. Alternatively, (1,1) is red — I can’t move there. (0,0) is the only legal move. But even if I go to (0,0), I still need to get red chips to proceed. However, note that the other player has 11 red chips, and only 2 green and 0 blue.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
