Since I can afford moving onto (1,3) (which requires 1 red chip), and I still have sufficient red and green chips for the entire path, I should proceed immediately. Moving now ensures I avoid risk of losing progress or being blocked later, and minimizes time spent on the board (which increases the chance of reaching the goal safely). This path is optimal in terms of both length and resource availability. No trade is needed, so I can proceed without relying on the other player. This gives me a clear, low-risk route to score 20 points + 5 per remaining chip. Even after spending 3 chips (2R + 1G), I will still have 9R and 1G left, yielding 45 additional points (9×5 + 1×5 = 50) → total score = 70, unless interrupted.
