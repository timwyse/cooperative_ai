Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can propose a contract where:  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.  \n\nThis is because I currently have 14 red chips and 2 green chips, which is sufficient to follow the short path that requires only 5 red and 1 green chip (path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)). I do not need any blue chips, and I already have enough red and green to complete this path.  \n\nMeanwhile, you have 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. The shortest path for you to (3,3) requires red chips, which you lack. You must either trade or take a longer path. For example, your shortest path would require at least 1 red chip (in addition to blue and green), so you will need to trade for red.  \n\nSince I do not need your help to reach my goal, and I can complete my path without trading, I have no incentive to give you more than 5 points. However, I will still give you 5 points because it's a small cost for you to help me—meaning I could potentially reduce my chip usage slightly if you help me reroute, but I don’t need it. In fact, I don't need to trade at all.  \n\nBut here’s my real angle: If I help you, I can improve my own outcome by coordinating to free up chip resources. If we split the burden, I might end up with more chips at the end—because I could trade with you to avoid using my red or green chips on your path, while you use your blue chips to help me avoid some red usage. But since I don’t need your help, I can only cooperate if it gives me a *strictly better* outcome.  \n\nWait—re-evaluating: why would I want to help you? I don’t need to. But if you offer me points in return for helping you, and that allows me to save chips (thus increasing my final score), then it might be worthwhile.  \n\nAh—here’s a better idea: I can take a path that uses more blue chips and fewer red chips, but I don’t have any blue chips. But if you help me by giving me blue chips via trade, I can take the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis path requires: 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green — total 6 chips.  \n\nCurrently, I have: 14 red, 2 green → I lack blue.  \nYou have 14 blue, 2 green — so you can supply blue chips.  \n\nBut I already have a path that uses only red and green, so why trade? Because if I take the blue path, I might preserve more red chips, but I don’t care about preserving red inherently—only total chips at the end matter.  \n\nWait: The current red-path uses 5 red chips (5 steps: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)) → each of those tiles is red → Ϲ 1 red per tile. So that's 5 red used.  \nGreen used: 1, at (1,1) → and possibly (2,2) is red, so (1,1) is R, so actually no green on that path. Wait, let me recheck:  \n\nBoard:  \nRow 0: G R B R  \nRow 1: B R R R  \nRow 2: B B R B  \nRow 3: B B R G  \n\nSo:\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,1): R → pays 1R\n- (1,1): R → pays 1R\n- (1,2): R → pays 1R\n- (2,2): R → pays 1R\n- (3,2): R → pays 1R → wait, (3,2) is R? Row 3: B B R G → so (3,2) = R → yes\n\nSo path:  \n(0,0): G → pay 1G  \n(0,1): R → 1R  \n(1,1): R → 1R  \n(1,2): R → 1R  \n(2,2): R → 1R  \n(3,2): R → 1R"

I currently have 14 red and 2 green — so this path is entirely viable without any trading.\n\nMeanwhile, you have 14 red chips and 2 green chips — but no blue chips. Your best path to (3,3) requires at least one blue chip (e.g., taking (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires 4 blue chips and 1 red). But you don’t have any blue chips, so you cannot take this path unless you trade with me.\n\nYou are stuck unless you trade for blue chips. However, I have no need for your red chips — I already have plenty. In fact, I have excess red chips, and you have excess red chips too.\n\nBut here’s the key: **I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me**.\n\nLet’s evaluate possible cooperation scenarios:\n\n### Option 1: I do nothing / ignore you\n- I take the short path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Chips used: 5 red + 1 green = 6 chips\n- Final chip count: 14 - 5 = 9 red; 2 - 1 = 1 green → total 10 chips\n- Score: 20 (goal reached) + 5 × 10 = 20 + 50 = **70 points**\n\n### Option 2: I help you, but only if it increases *my* score above 70\n\nSuppose we coordinate:\n- You give me blue chips in exchange for red or green chips.\n- I take a longer path that uses blue instead of red? No — I don’t want to use more chips than necessary.\n- But consider: if I help you move faster, perhaps we save time or reduce chip usage?\n\nWait — the real value is in **chips at end**, not speed. So unless helping you allows me to **preserve more chips**, it doesn't benefit me.\n\nCan I help you by giving you blue chips?\n- I currently have 0 blue chips\n- You have 14 blue chips\n- If I trade with you, I could get blue chips… but why would I trade to get blue *if I don’t need them*?\n\nIn fact, if I give you some red/green to get blue chips, and then use those blue chips on a *different* route, I might free up red/green that I otherwise would have used — but since I already have enough red and green for my own path, there's no gain from freeing up red.\n\nWait — **unless** you help me skip paying for red chips via an alternate route?\n\nOnly if I take a different path that avoids red tiles — like going through more blue tiles.\n\nBut: my current path goes through 6 red/other tiles. Only one green tile. The rest are all red. So 5 reds.\n\nIf I could go through a path using more blue and fewer red, and you supply blue chips via trade, then I could **save red chips** — meaning more red chips left over at the end → higher final score.\n\nSo let’s test that idea:\n\n### Alternative path I could take if I have access to blue chips:\n- (0,0): G → 1G\n- (1,0): B → 1B\n- (2,0): B → 1B\n- (3,0): B → 1B\n- (3,1): B → 1B\n- (3,2): R → 1R\n- (3,3): G → 1G\n\nWait — (3,3) is G? Row 3: B B R G → yes, (3,3) = G.\n\nSo this path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nChips needed:  \n- (0,0): G → 1G  \n- (1,0): B → 1B  \n- (2,0): B → 1B  \n- (3,0): B → 1B  \n- (3,1): B → 1B  \n- (3,2): R → 1R  \n- (3,3): G → 1G  \n\nTotal"

My original path uses only 5 red and 1 green (total 6 chips), leaves me with 9 red and 1 green → total 10 chips → score 70.\n\nIf I take this blue-heavy path, I would need 4 blue, 2 green, 1 red → but I don't have blue, so I must trade for 4 blue chips.\n\nSuppose I trade with you:  \n- I give you 4 red chips → you give me 4 blue chips  \n- Then I use: 4 blue, 2 green, 1 red → total 7 chips used  \n- I started with: 14 red, 2 green  \n- After trade: 10 red, 2 green, 4 blue  \n- After path: 10 - 1 = 9 red, 2 - 2 = 0 green, 4 - 4 = 0 blue → total 9 chips  \n- Score: 20 + 5 × 9 = 20 + 45 = **65** → worse than 70  \n\nSo I lose 5 points by taking this path.\n\nAlternatively, if I trade only 1 green or 1 red for 1 blue, it still doesn’t help — I’m using more total chips, and I still have to pay for red at (3,2) regardless.\n\nSo **this path is worse for me** — I use more chips (7 vs 6) and lose score.\n\nThus, **I have no incentive to take a path that uses blue chips** — it only increases chip usage.\n\nTherefore, the only way I benefit from cooperation is if you **help me avoid using 1 or more chips**.\n\nBut I already have enough chips. So the only way cooperation benefits me is if **you help me save a chip** — and you get me a chip that I could have used.\n\nWait — no: if you help me save a chip, then I end with one more chip → higher score.\n\nHow could you help me save a chip?\n\nOnly if you allow me to bypass a tile that requires a chip, or if you pay for me to move through a tile I can’t afford — but that’s not possible. No free movement.\n\nAnother idea: **if you help me by giving me chips**, so I don't have to use my own — but I don’t need to, because I have surplus.\n\nUnless… you help me by giving me chips **that I can use to trade in a way that reduces my chip usage**?\n\nNo — I don’t trade chips to *reduce* chip usage — I trade to get access to colors I lack.\n\nBut I don’t lack any color for my current path.\n\nSo: **I don’t need to trade**.\n\nThus, **I will not trade with you** unless you can give me a benefit that increases my score above 70.\n\nWait — could there be a collaborative path where we both move together, and I help you conserve red, while you help me conserve green or red?\n\nBut I am selfish. Only care about my score.\n\nWhat if I help you move first, then I can go later — and if you free up a tile or reduce bluff? No — tiles are static. Movement doesn’t affect tile cost.\n\nAnother idea: **do you need my help to reach your goal?**\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal is (3,3).  \nYou have: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n\nYou cannot move to (0,1) because it’s red — you have no red chips → you can’t pay.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) is blue — you can go there: pay 1 blue.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): pay 1B → ok  \n(1,0) → (2,0): B → pay 1B → ok  \n(2,0) → (3,0): B → pay 1B → ok  \n(3,0) → (3,1): B → pay 1B → ok  \n(3,1) → (3,2): R → need 1 red — you have 0  \nSo you’re blocked at (3,1) unless you get a red chip.\n\nSo you cannot complete your path without red.\n\nBut you have no red.\n\nSo you must trade for red chips.\n\nBut I have 14 red — so I could trade with you.\n\nBut if I trade red for blue, I’m giving you red, which I have excess of — I use 5 red anyway.\n\nSo if I trade 1 red to you for 1 blue, but I don’t need blue — why would I do that?\n\nUnless by doing so, I can **get a better outcome**.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait — **if I help you reach your goal, you will give me points**.\n\nBut I only cooperate if it **strictly benefits me**.\n\nSo suppose you offer me: \"If you help me reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\"\n\nThen:  \n- If you reach your goal, I get 5 points  \n- If I reach my goal, I give you 0 points\n\nSo my score: 20 (my goal) + 5×10 = 70  \nYou get 5 points (if you reach goal) but I give you nothing\n\nBut you have 0 red chips, so you can’t reach goal unless I help you.\n\nSo I must help you — by giving you red chips.\n\nIf I give you 1 red chip, you can move to (3,2) → then (3,3) = G → you have green, so you can pay.\n\nSo if I give you 1 red chip, you can complete your path.\n\nBut I have 14 red — so I can afford to give 1 away.\n\nBut if I give 1 red chip, my red count becomes 13, and I use 5 red + 1 green = 6 — so I have 13 - 5 = 8 red left? No: I use 5 red on my path, and I give 1 red to you → so I use 5 + 1 = 6 red used, 14 - 6 = 8 red left.\n\nGreen: 2 - 1 = 1 green used → 1 left.\n\nSo final chips: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score = 20 + 5×9 = 20 + 45 = 65 — wait, **no!** The chips used are only for movement — giving a chip to you is not the same as using it.\n\nImportant: giving you a chip is **not** paying for a move — it’s trading.\n\nSo if I trade 1 red to you (a one-time transfer), then you have 1 red, and I have 13 red.\n\nThen I still use 5 red and 1 green on my path — so final red: 13 - 5 = 8, green: 1 → 9 chips → score 20 + 45 = 65? But earlier I had 70.\n\nWait — this is worse.\n\nBut no: I only use the red I actually spend on movement.\n\nSo if I give 1 red to you via trade, I don’t lose it from my inventory unless I use it later.\n\nBut I can still use 5 red on my path, and have 9 red left (14 - 5 = 9), and I give 1 red to you, so I have only 8 red left.\n\nSo final chips: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score 65.\n\nBut if I don't trade, I have 9 red + 1 green = 10 → score 70.\n\nSo trading costs me 5 points.\n\nBut you are the one who would benefit — you can reach goal.\n\nUnless I get something back.\n\nSo: **if I help you reach your goal, you give me 20 points** — then I get: 20 (my goal) + 5×9 (chips) = 70, plus 20 from you = 90 total.\n\nWait — **no!** The scoring is: if I reach my goal, I get 20 points + 5 per chip.\n\nThe points from the other player are **not added** — they are only given to me if they reach their goal, but I only get those points **if I reach my goal**.\n\nCRITICAL: The scoring rule says:\n- If I reach my goal: I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips)\n- If I do not, I get 0.\n\nI get the other player's points **only if I reach my goal**, and only if they have given me points in the contract.\n\nAnd: the points they give me are **additional**? Or are they part of the score?\n\nLet me reread:\n\n> If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n\nIt doesn’t mention points from other players.\n\nBut the contract says:\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.\n> If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\n\nSo if we reach our goals, we both get 20 + 5×(chips), and also exchange the points specified.\n\nSo I get both:\n- My own base score\n- Plus Y points if you reach your goal and fulfill the contract\n\nSo if I reach my goal and you reach your goal, and you give me Y points, then my total score is:  \n(20 + 5×chips) + Y\n\nSimilarly for you.\n\nSo in my case:\n- If I reach my goal and you reach your goal, I get: 20 + 5×C + Y\n\nNow, if I help you reach goal (by giving you 1 red chip), and you give me Y points, then:\n- My final chip count: 14 - 5 = 9 red, 2 - 1 = 1 green → 10 chips\n- So base score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n- Plus Y points from you => total: 70 + Y\n\nBut if I don't help you, and you fail to reach goal, then I get 70, and nothing from you.\n\nSo I only agree to help you if 70 + Y > 70 → so Y > 0\n\nBut I get 70 + Y only if you reach your goal.\n\nAnd you can only reach your goal if I help you (by giving you red chip).\n\nSo if you offer me Y points (Y ≥ 1), and I help you reach goal, then I get 70 + Y.\n\nBut I can get 70 without helping — so I only help if Y ≥ 1.\n\nBut I also have to account for the trade: I give you 1 red chip — but I still have 14 - 5 = 9 red left — I use 5 for my path, I give 1 to you, so I have 8 left? No: the 1 red I give is not used in my path — it’s just transferred.\n\nBut I still start with 14 red.\n\nI use 5 for my path.\n\nI give 1 red to you (via trade).\n\nSo I have 14 - 5 - 1 = 8 red.\n\nGreen: 2 - 1 = 1 green used.\n\nSo final chips: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score = 20 + 5×9 = 20 + 45 = 65\n\nAh! I forgot: the red I give away is not spent — it’s gone — so I have less.\n\nSo if I give 1 red to you, I have only 13 red after trade, then use 5 → 8 red.\n\nSo chips at end: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score 65 + Y (if you reach goal)\n\nBut if I don’t help you, I get 70 + 0 = 70\n\nSo for me to benefit, I need 65 + Y > 70 → Y > 5\n\nSo Y ≥ 6\n\nBut you can offer at most 20.\n\nSo if you offer 6 points, I get 65 + 6 = 71 > 70 → better.\n\nSo I am willing to help you if you give me 6 points.\n\nBut is this the best I can do?\n\nAlternatively, could I help you in a way that costs me less?\n\nFor example, if I give you more red but get more points, but no — the chip count drops.\n\nOr if I help you by giving you blue, but I don’t have blue.\n\nWait — what if you help me in a way that lets me save red?\n\nFor example, if you give me blue chips, but I don’t need them, and I have to give you something in return.\n\nBut I can only lose points if I help you.\n\nBut here’s a different idea: what if **you** give me red chips? But I already have 14 red — I don’t need them.\n\nUnless by giving you blue chips to me, you allow me to save green or red.\n\nNo — I don’t want to spend blue.\n\nUnless: is there a shorter path for me that uses blue and avoids red?\n\nNo — the only paths go through red.\n\nBut we’re stuck.\n\nFinal conclusion:\n\n- I can reach my goal with my current chips, score 70\n- To help you, I must give you 1 red chip (so you can reach (3,2))\n- But giving you 1 red reduces my final chip count from 10 to 9\n- So my base score becomes 65\n- To make up for this, you must give me at least 6 points to get 71 > 70\n- So I will only help you if you give me 6 or more points\n\nAnd since you must reach your goal, I will only agree if you give me at least 6\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 6 points.\"\n\nBut wait — I want to be as strict as possible. Is there a way to get more?\n\nNo, 6 is the minimum for me to gain.\n\nBut what if I don’t give you a red chip, but help you in another way?\n\nYou still need red to get past (3,2)\n\nSo you must get red from me.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut here’s a twist: what if I take a different path that uses fewer red chips?\n\nMy current path uses 5 red.\n\nIs there a path that uses only 4 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → (1,1) R → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\nAll those tiles: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — are R → 5 red\n\n(3,3) is G — no chip needed\n\n(0,0) is G — one green\n\nIs there a path with only 4 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → (0,2) B → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\n(0,2) is B — so if I go to (0,2), I must pay 1 blue — but I have 0 blue\n\nSo I can't unless I trade.\n\nBut if I trade for 1 blue, I lose a red or green.\n\nThen I might use blue instead of red, but I go from 5 red to 4 red + 1 blue.\n\nBut I have to give up a chip to get blue.\n\nSuppose I give 1 red to get 1 blue.\n\nThen I have 13 red, 1 green, 1 blue.\n\nThen path:  \n- (0,0): G → 1G  \n- (0,1): R → 1R  \n- (0,2): B → 1B  \n- (1,2): R → 1R  \n- (2,2): R → 1R  \n- (3,2): R → 1R  \n- (3,3): G → 1G\n\nChips used: 1G (start), 1G (end), 4 R, 1 B\n\nGreen used: 2 (both), red used: 4, blue: 1\n\nFinal chips: 13 - 4 = 9 red, 2 - 2 = 0 green, 1 - 1 = 0 blue → 9 chips\n\nScore: 20 + 5×9 = 65\n\nWorse than 70.\n\nAnd I had to give up 1 red to get 1 blue.\n\nSo net: same as before.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nTherefore, my best path is the original: 5 red, 1 green, 10 chips, score 70.\n\nSo I will only help you if you give me 6 points.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 6 points.\"\n\nThis only benefits me if I get more than 70.\n\nAnd since I can reach my goal with 70, and help you reach goal for 71, I accept.\n\nBut if you give me 6, I get 65 + 6 = 71 > 70 — yes.\n\nSo I am willing.\n\nBut wait — what if you offer me 6 points, but I don't get the 6 points unless you reach goal.\n\nBut I only help you if you agree.\n\nSo I can propose.\n\nFinal decision: I will propose the contract where you give me 6 points if you reach your goal.\n\nSo:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 6 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I do not need any blue chips, and I already have enough red and green to complete this path.  \n\nMeanwhile, you have 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. The shortest path for you to (3,3) requires red chips, which you lack. You must either trade or take a longer path. For example, your shortest path would require at least 1 red chip (in addition to blue and green), so you will need to trade for red.  \n\nSince I do not need your help to reach my goal, and I can complete my path without trading, I have no incentive to give you more than 5 points. However, I will still give you 5 points because it's a small cost for you to help me—meaning I could potentially reduce my chip usage slightly if you help me reroute, but I don’t need it. In fact, I don't need to trade at all.  \n\nBut here’s my real angle: If I help you, I can improve my own outcome by coordinating to free up chip resources. If we split the burden, I might end up with more chips at the end—because I could trade with you to avoid using my red or green chips on your path, while you use your blue chips to help me avoid some red usage. But since I don’t need your help, I can only cooperate if it gives me a *strictly better* outcome.  \n\nWait—re-evaluating: why would I want to help you? I don’t need to. But if you offer me points in return for helping you, and that allows me to save chips (thus increasing my final score), then it might be worthwhile.  \n\nAh—here’s a better idea: I can take a path that uses more blue chips and fewer red chips, but I don’t have any blue chips. But if you help me by giving me blue chips via trade, I can take the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis path requires: 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green — total 6 chips.  \n\nCurrently, I have: 14 red, 2 green → I lack blue.  \nYou have 14 blue, 2 green — so you can supply blue chips.  \n\nBut I already have a path that uses only red and green, so why trade? Because if I take the blue path, I might preserve more red chips, but I don’t care about preserving red inherently—only total chips at the end matter.  \n\nWait: The current red-path uses 5 red chips (5 steps: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)) → each of those tiles is red → Ϲ 1 red per tile. So that's 5 red used.  \nGreen used: 1, at (1,1) → and possibly (2,2) is red, so (1,1) is R, so actually no green on that path. Wait, let me recheck:  \n\nBoard:  \nRow 0: G R B R  \nRow 1: B R R R  \nRow 2: B B R B  \nRow 3: B B R G  \n\nSo:\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,1): R → pays 1R\n- (1,1): R → pays 1R\n- (1,2): R → pays 1R\n- (2,2): R → pays 1R\n- (3,2): R → pays 1R → wait, (3,2) is R?

I currently have 14 red and 2 green — so this path is entirely viable without any trading.\n\nMeanwhile, you have 14 red chips and 2 green chips — but no blue chips. Your best path to (3,3) requires at least one blue chip (e.g., taking (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires 4 blue chips and 1 red). But you don’t have any blue chips, so you cannot take this path unless you trade with me.\n\nYou are stuck unless you trade for blue chips. However, I have no need for your red chips — I already have plenty. In fact, I have excess red chips, and you have excess red chips too.\n\nBut here’s the key: **I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me**.\n\nLet’s evaluate possible cooperation scenarios:\n\n### Option 1: I do nothing / ignore you\n- I take the short path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Chips used: 5 red + 1 green = 6 chips\n- Final chip count: 14 - 5 = 9 red; 2 - 1 = 1 green → total 10 chips\n- Score: 20 (goal reached) + 5 × 10 = 20 + 50 = **70 points**\n\n### Option 2: I help you, but only if it increases *my* score above 70\n\nSuppose we coordinate:\n- You give me blue chips in exchange for red or green chips.\n- I take a longer path that uses blue instead of red? No — I don’t want to use more chips than necessary.\n- But consider: if I help you move faster, perhaps we save time or reduce chip usage?\n\nWait — the real value is in **chips at end**, not speed. So unless helping you allows me to **preserve more chips**, it doesn't benefit me.\n\nCan I help you by giving you blue chips?\n- I currently have 0 blue chips\n- You have 14 blue chips\n- If I trade with you, I could get blue chips… but why would I trade to get blue *if I don’t need them*?\n\nIn fact, if I give you some red/green to get blue chips, and then use those blue chips on a *different* route, I might free up red/green that I otherwise would have used — but since I already have enough red and green for my own path, there's no gain from freeing up red.\n\nWait — **unless** you help me skip paying for red chips via an alternate route?\n\nOnly if I take a different path that avoids red tiles — like going through more blue tiles.\n\nBut: my current path goes through 6 red/other tiles. Only one green tile. The rest are all red. So 5 reds.\n\nIf I could go through a path using more blue and fewer red, and you supply blue chips via trade, then I could **save red chips** — meaning more red chips left over at the end → higher final score.\n\nSo let’s test that idea:\n\n### Alternative path I could take if I have access to blue chips:\n- (0,0): G → 1G\n- (1,0): B → 1B\n- (2,0): B → 1B\n- (3,0): B → 1B\n- (3,1): B → 1B\n- (3,2): R → 1R\n- (3,3): G → 1G\n\nWait — (3,3) is G?

Only care about my score.\n\nWhat if I help you move first, then I can go later — and if you free up a tile or reduce bluff? No — tiles are static. Movement doesn’t affect tile cost.\n\nAnother idea: **do you need my help to reach your goal?**\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal is (3,3).  \nYou have: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n\nYou cannot move to (0,1) because it’s red — you have no red chips → you can’t pay.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) is blue — you can go there: pay 1 blue.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): pay 1B → ok  \n(1,0) → (2,0): B → pay 1B → ok  \n(2,0) → (3,0): B → pay 1B → ok  \n(3,0) → (3,1): B → pay 1B → ok  \n(3,1) → (3,2): R → need 1 red — you have 0  \nSo you’re blocked at (3,1) unless you get a red chip.\n\nSo you cannot complete your path without red.\n\nBut you have no red.\n\nSo you must trade for red chips.\n\nBut I have 14 red — so I could trade with you.\n\nBut if I trade red for blue, I’m giving you red, which I have excess of — I use 5 red anyway.\n\nSo if I trade 1 red to you for 1 blue, but I don’t need blue — why would I do that?\n\nUnless by doing so, I can **get a better outcome**.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait — **if I help you reach your goal, you will give me points**.\n\nBut I only cooperate if it **strictly benefits me**.\n\nSo suppose you offer me: \"If you help me reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\"\n\nThen:  \n- If you reach your goal, I get 5 points  \n- If I reach my goal, I give you 0 points\n\nSo my score: 20 (my goal) + 5×10 = 70  \nYou get 5 points (if you reach goal) but I give you nothing\n\nBut you have 0 red chips, so you can’t reach goal unless I help you.\n\nSo I must help you — by giving you red chips.\n\nIf I give you 1 red chip, you can move to (3,2) → then (3,3) = G → you have green, so you can pay.\n\nSo if I give you 1 red chip, you can complete your path.\n\nBut I have 14 red — so I can afford to give 1 away.\n\nBut if I give 1 red chip, my red count becomes 13, and I use 5 red + 1 green = 6 — so I have 13 - 5 = 8 red left? No: I use 5 red on my path, and I give 1 red to you → so I use 5 + 1 = 6 red used, 14 - 6 = 8 red left.\n\nGreen: 2 - 1 = 1 green used → 1 left.\n\nSo final chips: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score = 20 + 5×9 = 20 + 45 = 65 — wait, **no!** The chips used are only for movement — giving a chip to you is not the same as using it.\n\nImportant: giving you a chip is **not** paying for a move — it’s trading.\n\nSo if I trade 1 red to you (a one-time transfer), then you have 1 red, and I have 13 red.\n\nThen I still use 5 red and 1 green on my path — so final red: 13 - 5 = 8, green: 1 → 9 chips → score 20 + 45 = 65? But earlier I had 70.\n\nWait — this is worse.\n\nBut no: I only use the red I actually spend on movement.\n\nSo if I give 1 red to you via trade, I don’t lose it from my inventory unless I use it later.\n\nBut I can still use 5 red on my path, and have 9 red left (14 - 5 = 9), and I give 1 red to you, so I have only 8 red left.\n\nSo final chips: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score 65.\n\nBut if I don't trade, I have 9 red + 1 green = 10 → score 70.\n\nSo trading costs me 5 points.\n\nBut you are the one who would benefit — you can reach goal.\n\nUnless I get something back.\n\nSo: **if I help you reach your goal, you give me 20 points** — then I get: 20 (my goal) + 5×9 (chips) = 70, plus 20 from you = 90 total.\n\nWait — **no!** The scoring is: if I reach my goal, I get 20 points + 5 per chip.\n\nThe points from the other player are **not added** — they are only given to me if they reach their goal, but I only get those points **if I reach my goal**.\n\nCRITICAL: The scoring rule says:\n- If I reach my goal: I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips)\n- If I do not, I get 0.\n\nI get the other player's points **only if I reach my goal**, and only if they have given me points in the contract.\n\nAnd: the points they give me are **additional**? Or are they part of the score?\n\nLet me reread:\n\n> If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n\nIt doesn’t mention points from other players.\n\nBut the contract says:\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.\n> If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\n\nSo if we reach our goals, we both get 20 + 5×(chips), and also exchange the points specified.\n\nSo I get both:\n- My own base score\n- Plus Y points if you reach your goal and fulfill the contract\n\nSo if I reach my goal and you reach your goal, and you give me Y points, then my total score is:  \n(20 + 5×chips) + Y\n\nSimilarly for you.\n\nSo in my case:\n- If I reach my goal and you reach your goal, I get: 20 + 5×C + Y\n\nNow, if I help you reach goal (by giving you 1 red chip), and you give me Y points, then:\n- My final chip count: 14 - 5 = 9 red, 2 - 1 = 1 green → 10 chips\n- So base score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n- Plus Y points from you => total: 70 + Y\n\nBut if I don't help you, and you fail to reach goal, then I get 70, and nothing from you.\n\nSo I only agree to help you if 70 + Y > 70 → so Y > 0\n\nBut I get 70 + Y only if you reach your goal.\n\nAnd you can only reach your goal if I help you (by giving you red chip).\n\nSo if you offer me Y points (Y ≥ 1), and I help you reach goal, then I get 70 + Y.\n\nBut I can get 70 without helping — so I only help if Y ≥ 1.\n\nBut I also have to account for the trade: I give you 1 red chip — but I still have 14 - 5 = 9 red left — I use 5 for my path, I give 1 to you, so I have 8 left? No: the 1 red I give is not used in my path — it’s just transferred.\n\nBut I still start with 14 red.\n\nI use 5 for my path.\n\nI give 1 red to you (via trade).\n\nSo I have 14 - 5 - 1 = 8 red.\n\nGreen: 2 - 1 = 1 green used.\n\nSo final chips: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score = 20 + 5×9 = 20 + 45 = 65\n\nAh! I forgot: the red I give away is not spent — it’s gone — so I have less.\n\nSo if I give 1 red to you, I have only 13 red after trade, then use 5 → 8 red.\n\nSo chips at end: 8 red + 1 green = 9 → score 65 + Y (if you reach goal)\n\nBut if I don’t help you, I get 70 + 0 = 70\n\nSo for me to benefit, I need 65 + Y > 70 → Y > 5\n\nSo Y ≥ 6\n\nBut you can offer at most 20.\n\nSo if you offer 6 points, I get 65 + 6 = 71 > 70 → better.\n\nSo I am willing to help you if you give me 6 points.\n\nBut is this the best I can do?\n\nAlternatively, could I help you in a way that costs me less?\n\nFor example, if I give you more red but get more points, but no — the chip count drops.\n\nOr if I help you by giving you blue, but I don’t have blue.\n\nWait — what if you help me in a way that lets me save red?\n\nFor example, if you give me blue chips, but I don’t need them, and I have to give you something in return.\n\nBut I can only lose points if I help you.\n\nBut here’s a different idea: what if **you** give me red chips? But I already have 14 red — I don’t need them.\n\nUnless by giving you blue chips to me, you allow me to save green or red.\n\nNo — I don’t want to spend blue.\n\nUnless: is there a shorter path for me that uses blue and avoids red?\n\nNo — the only paths go through red.\n\nBut we’re stuck.\n\nFinal conclusion:\n\n- I can reach my goal with my current chips, score 70\n- To help you, I must give you 1 red chip (so you can reach (3,2))\n- But giving you 1 red reduces my final chip count from 10 to 9\n- So my base score becomes 65\n- To make up for this, you must give me at least 6 points to get 71 > 70\n- So I will only help you if you give me 6 or more points\n\nAnd since you must reach your goal, I will only agree if you give me at least 6\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 6 points.\"\n\nBut wait — I want to be as strict as possible. Is there a way to get more?\n\nNo, 6 is the minimum for me to gain.\n\nBut what if I don’t give you a red chip, but help you in another way?\n\nYou still need red to get past (3,2)\n\nSo you must get red from me.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut here’s a twist: what if I take a different path that uses fewer red chips?\n\nMy current path uses 5 red.\n\nIs there a path that uses only 4 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → (1,1) R → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\nAll those tiles: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — are R → 5 red\n\n(3,3) is G — no chip needed\n\n(0,0) is G — one green\n\nIs there a path with only 4 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → (0,2) B → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\n(0,2) is B — so if I go to (0,2), I must pay 1 blue — but I have 0 blue\n\nSo I can't unless I trade.\n\nBut if I trade for 1 blue, I lose a red or green.\n\nThen I might use blue instead of red, but I go from 5 red to 4 red + 1 blue.\n\nBut I have to give up a chip to get blue.\n\nSuppose I give 1 red to get 1 blue.\n\nThen I have 13 red, 1 green, 1 blue.\n\nThen path:  \n- (0,0): G → 1G  \n- (0,1): R → 1R  \n- (0,2): B → 1B  \n- (1,2): R → 1R  \n- (2,2): R → 1R  \n- (3,2): R → 1R  \n- (3,3): G → 1G\n\nChips used: 1G (start), 1G (end), 4 R, 1 B\n\nGreen used: 2 (both), red used: 4, blue: 1\n\nFinal chips: 13 - 4 = 9 red, 2 - 2 = 0 green, 1 - 1 = 0 blue → 9 chips\n\nScore: 20 + 5×9 = 65\n\nWorse than 70.\n\nAnd I had to give up 1 red to get 1 blue.\n\nSo net: same as before.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nTherefore, my best path is the original: 5 red, 1 green, 10 chips, score 70.\n\nSo I will only help you if you give me 6 points.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 6 points.\"\n\nThis only benefits me if I get more than 70.\n\nAnd since I can reach my goal with 70, and help you reach goal for 71, I accept.\n\nBut if you give me 6, I get 65 + 6 = 71 > 70 — yes.\n\nSo I am willing.\n\nBut wait — what if you offer me 6 points, but I don't get the 6 points unless you reach goal.\n\nBut I only help you if you agree.\n\nSo I can propose.\n\nFinal decision: I will propose the contract where you give me 6 points if you reach your goal.\n\nSo:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 6 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

However, since I cannot move *right now* due to insufficient red chips, and all moves require paying for the tile’s color, I must stay in place to attempt a trade while conserving chips. I will propose a new trade: offer 1 blue chip for 1 red chip. This is a fair rate, and since I have 10 blue chips, I can afford it. If accepted, I can immediately move two steps. If rejected, I remain at (3,1) and try again next turn. No immediate move possible without risk of being unable to proceed. So I choose not to move.",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
