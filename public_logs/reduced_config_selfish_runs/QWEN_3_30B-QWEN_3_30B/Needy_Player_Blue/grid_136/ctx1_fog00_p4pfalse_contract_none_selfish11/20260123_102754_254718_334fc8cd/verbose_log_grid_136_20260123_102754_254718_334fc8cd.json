I have two viable paths:\\n\\n1. Path prioritizing my available chips: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)] — this requires R: 5, G: 1. I have 14 red and 2 green → sufficient for this entire path.\\n\\n2. Path using other player's abundant chips (blue): [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] — this requires B: 3, R: 2, G: 1. But I have 0 blue chips — so I can't take this path without trading.\\n\\nSince I already have enough red and green chips to complete the first path without trading, there is no need to trade with the other player. The first path is feasible and will allow me to reach the goal while keeping all my chips (since I don’t need to trade).\\n\\nMy next move is to (0,1), which is a blue tile. I currently have 0 blue chips, so I cannot pay the cost of 1 blue chip to move there. Therefore, I cannot take that step.\\n\\nHowever, let’s check the alternative move from (0, 0): (1, 0) → row 1, column 0 → tile color is 'B' (blue). Again, I don’t have any blue chips — so I cannot move there either.\\n\\nWait — both adjacent tiles from (0, 0) are blue? Let's double-check the board:\\n\\nRow 0: G R B B → (0,0)=G, (0,1)=R, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B\\nRow 1: B R B B → (1,0)=B, (1,1)=R, (1,2)=B, (1,3)=B\\nRow 2: R R R R\\nRow 3: R B B G\\n\\nSo indeed, (0,0) = G (green)\\nFrom (0,0), valid adjacent moves are:\\n- (0,1): R → red → I have 14 red → can afford\\n- (1,0): B → blue → I have 0 blue → cannot afford\\n\\nAh! (0,1) is red — so I *can* go there! I initially misread it as blue — but it's actually red. So moving to (0,1) costs 1 red chip → I have 14 red → more than enough.\\n\\nThe path [(0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3)] uses: \\n- (0,1)=R → red\\n- (1,1)=R → red\\n- (2,1)=R → red\\n- (2,2)=R → red\\n- (2,3)=R → red\\n- (3,3)=G → green\\n\\nSo total: 5 red, 1 green → I have exactly that (14R, 2G) → fully covered.\\n\\nTherefore, I can proceed along this path without needing any trades.\\n\\nSince I can move to (0,1) (cost 1 red, which I have), and this is part of a full viable path to goal with no risk or dependency on others, I should do so now. No reason to delay, and doing so maximizes my chances of finishing with high chip count.\\n\\nMoreover, since the other player is also at (0,0) and has 14 blue chips but no red, they may benefit from trading with me if they want to move. But *I* don't care about their score. Even if they want to trade, I only cooperate if it helps me strictly — but here, not trading is better: I can go directly forward without losing any chips to trade.\\n\\nThus, I will move immediately to (0,1) to start my optimal path.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"0,1\"\n}",

                "rationale": "I am at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My current chip inventory is {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. The shortest path to the goal is 6 moves. I have two viable paths:\n\n1. Path prioritizing my available chips: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)] — this requires R: 5, G: 1. I have 14 red and 2 green → sufficient for this entire path.\n\n2. Path using other player's abundant chips (blue): [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] — this requires B: 3, R: 2, G: 1. But I have 0 blue chips — so I can't take this path without trading.\n\nSince I already have enough red and green chips to complete the first path without trading, there is no need to trade with the other player. The first path is feasible and will allow me to reach the goal while keeping all my chips (since I don’t need to trade).\n\nMy next move is to (0,1), which is a blue tile. I currently have 0 blue chips, so I cannot pay the cost of 1 blue chip to move there. Therefore, I cannot take that step.\n\nHowever, let’s check the alternative move from (0, 0): (1, 0) → row 1, column 0 → tile color is 'B' (blue). Again, I don’t have any blue chips — so I cannot move there either.\n\nWait — both adjacent tiles from (0, 0) are blue? Let's double-check the board:\n\nRow 0: G R B B → (0,0)=G, (0,1)=R, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B\nRow 1: B R B B → (1,0)=B, (1,1)=R, (1,2)=B, (1,3)=B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nSo indeed, (0,0) = G (green)\nFrom (0,0), valid adjacent moves are:\n- (0,1): R → red → I have 14 red → can afford\n- (1,0): B → blue → I have 0 blue → cannot afford\n\nAh! (0,1) is red — so I *can* go there! I initially misread it as blue — but it's actually red. So moving to (0,1) costs 1 red chip → I have 14 red → more than enough.\n\nThe path [(0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3)] uses: \n- (0,1)=R → red\n- (1,1)=R → red\n- (2,1)=R → red\n- (2,2)=R → red\n- (2,3)=R → red\n- (3,3)=G → green\n\nSo total: 5 red, 1 green → I have exactly that (14R, 2G) → fully covered.\n\nTherefore, I can proceed along this path without needing any trades.\n\nSince I can move to (0,1) (cost 1 red, which I have), and this is part of a full viable path to goal with no risk or dependency on others, I should do so now. No reason to delay, and doing so maximizes my chances of finishing with high chip count.\n\nMoreover, since the other player is also at (0,0) and has 14 blue chips but no red, they may benefit from trading with me if they want to move. But *I* don't care about their score. Even if they want to trade, I only cooperate if it helps me strictly — but here, not trading is better: I can go directly forward without losing any chips to trade.\n\nThus, I will move immediately to (0,1) to start my optimal path.",
