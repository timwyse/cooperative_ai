Finally, (3,3) costs 1 green chip — I have 2, so plenty.\\n\\nThis entire path is feasible with my current chips, and does not require trading. Moving along this path gives me 5 steps to goal, with only minor chip loss (R:1, B:3, G:1).

                "rationale": "I am currently at (1, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path to the goal requires 4 steps: (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which is 5 steps. However, I can consider a slightly shorter path if possible, but the immediate options are limited.\n\nThe most efficient path in terms of chip usage and length is: (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which takes 5 steps. Let's analyze the required chips:\n- (2,0) → tile color is R (from board layout: Row 2, Col 0 = R)\n- (3,0) → tile color is B\n- (3,1) → tile color is B\n- (3,2) → tile color is B\n- (3,3) → tile color is G\n\nSo the full path requires: R (1), B (3), G (1). I currently have: R(1), B(10), G(2). Therefore, I have enough for all these chips — I only need 1 R, and I already have it (and only need 1 more R for this step, but I just used it at (2,0)).\n\nMy current move: from (1,0) to (2,0). (2,0) is Red. I have 1 red chip — sufficient to pay the cost of 1 red chip.\n\nThus, I can safely move to (2,0) without requiring any trade. After that, moving to (3,0) costs 1 blue chip — I have 10 blue chips, so no problem. Then (3,1) and (3,2) each cost 1 blue chip — still well within my inventory. Finally, (3,3) costs 1 green chip — I have 2, so plenty.\n\nThis entire path is feasible with my current chips, and does not require trading. Moving along this path gives me 5 steps to goal, with only minor chip loss (R:1, B:3, G:1). I will end up with: R:0, B:7, G:1 — resulting in 20 + 5*(7+1) = 20 + 40 = 60 points if I complete.\n\nSince I don't need to trade, and this path is safe and optimal, I should proceed immediately.\n\nMoreover, the other player is at (1,0), also aiming for (3,3). They have a lot of red chips (11) but only 2 green and 4 blue — they would likely benefit from trading red for green or blue if needed. But since my path doesn't require any trade, I see no incentive to cooperate unless it gives me extra benefit — and it won’t here. So I’ll go solo.",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
