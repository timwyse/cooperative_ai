Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I, however, do not need anything from them — I can go alone.  \n\nNow, if I help them by trading Red chips, they can reach their goal and get 20 points, plus 5 points per chip they have left at end. But that means I lose some of my Red chips, which I could otherwise keep.  \n\nBut I don’t need to cooperate. I can go straight to goal with only my own chips and finish with:  \n- 20 + (5 × 14 - 5 - 1) = 20 + (5 × 8) = 20 + 40 = **60 points**  \nWait — let me recalculate:  \n- I start with 14 Red, 2 Green  \n- I use 5 Red, 1 Green → 9 Red, 1 Green left  \n- Final score: 20 + (5 × 9) + (5 × 1) = 20 + 45 + 5 = **70 points**\n\nSo I can achieve **70 points** alone.\n\nIf I help the other player, I will have to give up some Red chips. Even if I only give them 2 Red chips, I’ll lose at least 2 chips, reducing my final count.  \n\nBut the key is: *Can I make this trade profitable for me?*  \n\nNo — because they can't give me any Red chips (they have 0), and they can't give me anything useful for my path. Their Green and Blue chips are not useful to me.  \n\nSo if I help them, I’m giving them chips for nothing in return.  \n\nUnless they agree to give me a *point bonus* in return. But since I can already get 70 points alone, I only accept cooperation if *I get more than 70 points* by cooperating.  \n\nBut the maximum I can get is 20 + 5 × (remaining chips). Even if I keep 14 chips, I get 20 + 70 = **90** — but only if I don’t spend any. But I must spend 6 chips to move (but 5 R and 1 G).  \n\nWait: to get 90 points, I need 14 chips left → I’d have to spend only 1 chip. But I must spend one chip per move — 6 moves → must spend 6 chips. So max 14 - 6 = 8 chips left → max 20 + 40 = **60**, no — wait:\n\nWait: each move costs 1 chip of the tile’s color. I take 6 moves. I start with 14 R, 2 G. I use 5 R and 1 G → 9 R, 1 G left → 10 chips → 5 × 10 = 50 → 20 + 50 = **70**.\n\nMaximum possible score for me: **70**\n\nSo unless I can get more than 70 points by cooperating, it’s useless.\n\nBut if I help the other player, I must give them 2 Red chips → then I have only 12 R and 2 G → use 5 R, 1 G → 7 R, 1 G left → 8 chips → 20 + 40"

Since this path is short (only 4 steps) and fully feasible with my current inventory, it maximizes my chip count at completion (I’ll finish with 12 - 3 = 9 R and 2 - 1 = 1 G, totaling 10 chips). This gives me 20 + 5×10 = 70 points if I reach the goal.\n\nThe alternative path via (0,0) → ... → (3,3) is longer (6 steps), requires B chips (which I lack), and would force me to trade with the other player for blue chips. But since I don’t need to trade and can go straight to the goal with no risk or cost in negotiation, there's no benefit in taking a longer route that forces dependencies on the other player.\n\nAlso, note that the contract terms are currently 0 points either way, so helping the other player reach their goal gives me no direct benefit. Since I only care about maximizing my own score, I should not cooperate unless it directly increases my score. There’s no reason to deviate from the optimal, low-risk, high-reward path now.\n\nTherefore, I will move to (2, 1) next — it’s the first step of the optimal path.",

However, I can consider alternative paths that avoid red tiles if possible. The shortest path from (0, 0) to (3, 3) is 6 steps, but many of the tiles along the shortest known path require red chips, which I lack. The path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] requires 2 red chips (on (1,0) and (2,0)? Wait — no: let's verify the tile colors per position: Row 1: R R B B → so (1,0) = R, (2,0) = R, (3,0) = B. So the path actually requires: (1,0)=R, (2,0)=R → 2 red chips, and then (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G → so total required: R:2, B:3, G:1.
