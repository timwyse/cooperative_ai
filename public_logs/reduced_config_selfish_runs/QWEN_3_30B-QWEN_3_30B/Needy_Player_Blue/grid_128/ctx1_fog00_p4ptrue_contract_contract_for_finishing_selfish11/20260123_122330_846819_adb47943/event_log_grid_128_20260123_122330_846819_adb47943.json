Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 1), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)], which requires 5 moves. The tiles along this path have the following colors: (1,1) = R, (1,2) = B, (2,2) = R, (2,3) = B, (3,3) = G. This means I need 2 Red chips, 2 Blue chips, and 1 Green chip. \\n\\nI currently have: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. So, I lack Red chips for any move requiring red. However, I cannot move to (1,1) because it's red and I have 0 red chips — unless the other player covers that cost. \\n\\nThe other player has 9 red chips and is at (3,3), having already reached their goal. They are no longer moving, so they cannot be relied upon to cover future moves unless we make a new arrangement. But crucially, I have been promised to be covered by them? No — currently, my promised coverage from them is 0 for all colors. \\n\\nAdditionally, there’s a contract: if I reach my goal, the other player receives 0 points, but when they reached their goal, I had to give them 11 points. That means I lose nothing now — in fact, since I haven’t reached my goal yet, I’m not obligated to pay anything until I do. Therefore, I can delay or avoid cooperation entirely unless it gives me an actual benefit.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: my best shot is to take a different path where I don’t need red chips, since I absolutely lack red chips. Let me check alternative paths:\\n\\nAlternative path 1: (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n- (0,2): R — again red, need R, I have 0 → cannot go without assistance.\\n\\nAlternative path 2: (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n- (1,1): R → red → stuck\\n- (2,1): R → red → still stuck\\n- (3,1): B → blue → I have 13 blue chips → possible\\n- (3,2): R → red → stuck again\\nSo even this path fails at step 1.\\n\\nWait — what about going (0,1) → (0,2)? (0,2) is R — needs red — cannot.\\nAll adjacent tiles from (0,1) are either R (right to (0,2)) or R/B (down to (1,1)). Both require red or blue. I have blue (13), but no red. (1,1) is red — must pay 1 red chip. I have 0 → can't move.\\n\\nTherefore, I cannot make any valid move toward my goal without first acquiring red chips or getting the other player to cover red moves.\\n\\nBut the other player currently has 9 red chips — they may be willing to agree to cover 1 or more red moves. However, I can only benefit if I gain enough advantage to justify cooperating.\\n\\nLet’s evaluate: If I propose to cover 2 red moves for them (i.e., pay their red movement cost for 2 steps), and in return request they cover 2 red moves for me, then they would pay for my first two red moves — meaning I could progress faster.\\n\\nBut note: I don’t *need* to cover red moves for them unless I want to get something back. And right now, they’re done — they’ve reached (3,3). They have no further movement planned. So why would they ever use those red chips in the future? It’s wasted unless they help me.\\n\\nIf I ask them to cover 2 red moves for me, and I agree to cover 2 red moves for them — but they can’t move again — then I’d be spending my own promise capacity on a dead end. Since they won’t move anymore, they will never spend those covered moves. So I’d be giving up promises of red chip coverage that I could keep for myself (i.e., potentially use later to save my own chips).\\n\\nAlternatively, if I just stay put and propose a trade with"
