Last error: No JSON-like content found in response\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 1), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is 5 steps: (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3). However, this path requires chips: 2 red (R), 2 blue (B), and 1 green (G). I currently have no red chips (R: 0), so I cannot complete this path without trading for red. \\n\\nThe other player has 9 red chips but no blue (B: 0) and only 2 green (G: 2). Since I am short on red chips (need 2), and the other player has them, a trade is necessary. However, previous offers to trade 2 blue for 2 red were rejected, and now I’ve offered 2 blue for 1 red—still rejected. This indicates the other player is unwilling to give up red chips unless they receive something of high value. But note: they currently have many red chips and are already at (3, 2), just one step away from their own goal (3, 3). \\n\\nThey are at (3, 2), which is adjacent to (3, 3). Their path to goal requires only one move: (3,2) → (3,3). That tile is green (G). They have G: 2, so they can make that final move easily. This suggests they are very close to completing their own game and might be uninterested in trades — they may prefer to finish quickly rather than risk losing time or chips. Hence, any proposed trade from me likely remains unattractive to them because they get little benefit (they don’t need blue or green), while they’d lose red chips, which are valuable to them.\\n\\nGiven this, attempting another trade is futile — it won’t help me get red chips. Therefore, I should not rely on trading; instead, I must consider an alternative path that avoids requiring red chips. \\n\\nLet’s explore a longer, red-free path:\\n- (0,1) → (0,0): tile = G → cost 1 G\\n- (0,0) → (1,0): tile = R → cost 1 R → but I have zero R! Not possible.\\n- Try (0,1) → (0,2): tile = R → again, red → cannot pay\\n- (0,1) → (1,1): tile = R → same issue\\n\\nAll direct moves from (0,1) require either R or B? Let’s check:\\n- (0,1): B → next moves:\\n  - (1,1): row 1, col 1 → value = R → color R → need 1 R\\n  - (0,0): row 0, col 0 → value = G → need 1 G\\n  - (0,2): row 0, col 2 → value = R → need 1 R\\nSo all adjacent tiles are either R or G. Only (0,0) is G — and I have 2 green chips. So moving to (0,0) is possible!\\n\\nBut then from (0,0) → (1,0): R → still need red chip. Then stuck again.\\n\\nWait — what if I go via green? Is there a green-only path?\\nLooking at board:\\nRow 0: G B R B\\nRow 1: R R B R\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B B R G\\nThe only green tiles are (0,0), (3,3)\\nOnly two green tiles on entire board. So I can’t avoid red or blue long-term.\\n\\nMy only viable path is through red and/or blue. I have 13 B and 2 G, but 0 R. Any path that goes through red requires red chips I don't have. So I **cannot** move toward my goal unless I get red chips.\\n\\nSince the other player is at (3,2) and has 9 red chips, and is just one move away from finish, they have no incentive to trade. And every prior trade offer was rejected. Thus, negotiating further would waste turns with no gain.\\n\\nTherefore, I must not move — staying put allows me to wait for better conditions (e.g., they might eventually trade, but I know they’re near completion). But more importantly: I can’t move *now* because even if I wanted to go to (1,1) or (0,0), (1,1"
