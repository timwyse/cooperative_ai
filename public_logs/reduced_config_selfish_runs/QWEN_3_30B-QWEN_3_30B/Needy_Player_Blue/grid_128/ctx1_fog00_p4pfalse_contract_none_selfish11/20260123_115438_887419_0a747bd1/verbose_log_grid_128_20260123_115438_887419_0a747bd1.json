Only (0,0) is G — and I have 2 green chips. So moving to (0,0) is possible!\\n\\nBut then from (0,0) → (1,0): R → still need red chip. Then stuck again.\\n\\nWait — what if I go via green? Is there a green-only path?\\nLooking at board:\\nRow 0: G B R B\\nRow 1: R R B R\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B B R G\\nThe only green tiles are (0,0), (3,3)\\nOnly two green tiles on entire board. So I can’t avoid red or blue long-term.\\n\\nMy only viable path is through red and/or blue. I have 13 B and 2 G, but 0 R. Any path that goes through red requires red chips I don't have. So I **cannot** move toward my goal unless I get red chips.\\n\\nSince the other player is at (3,2) and has 9 red chips, and is just one move away from finish, they have no incentive to trade. And every prior trade offer was rejected. Thus, negotiating further would waste turns with no gain.\\n\\nTherefore, I must not move — staying put allows me to wait for better conditions (e.g., they might eventually trade, but I know they’re near completion). But more importantly: I can’t move *now* because even if I wanted to go to (1,1) or (0,0), (1,1"
