Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 1), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The other player is at (2, 1) with chips {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}. I have a contract where the other player will cover the cost of Red chips on tile (3,2), which is critical for a short path. The shortest viable path to my goal is: (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3,2) → (3,3). However, (2,1) is already occupied by the other player, so I cannot move there unless they move away—but they may not do so voluntarily.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider moving toward (1,1): from (0,1) to (1,1). This tile is red (R). I have 0 red chips, so I cannot afford it without trading or using a contract. But I don’t have a contract covering (1,1) — only (1,0) and (3,2) are covered in the contract for me.\\n\\nThe next valid option is to go down from (0,1) to (1,1), but since (1,1) is red and I have no red chips, I can't afford it without a trade or contract. There is no contract for (1,1), and I cannot afford it directly.\\n\\nHowever, I notice that another candidate path is: (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3). Let’s evaluate this:\\n- (0,2): red → requires R → I have 0 → cannot pay.\\n- (1,2): blue → I have 13 B → OK.\\nBut (0,2) is red — I cannot move there.\\n\\nNow consider: (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3):\\n- (1,1): red → need R → I don't have any → cannot pay.\\n- (2,1): occupied by opponent → cannot move into their spot unless they vacate it.\\n\\nBut wait—what if I use the contract? I already have a contract where the other player will pay for a red chip at (3,2) — meaning I can move onto (3,2) even if I have no red chips. So (3,2) is safe if I reach it via another route.\\n\\nSo how can I reach (3,2)? Only from (2,2) or (3,1).\\n(3,1) is blue → I have 13 blue chips → I could move there.\\nBut (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): (3,2) is red → covered by contract → I can pay for it via other player’s red chip.\\n\\nHow to get to (3,1)? From (2,1) → (3,1), but (2,1) is occupied by the other player.\\nFrom (3,0)? (3,0) is blue → I have 13 blue → OK. But I'm at (0,1) → can't jump.\\n\\nAlternative path: (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n- (1,1): red → I have no R → cannot pay → blocked.\\n- But if I could somehow bypass this?\\n\\nWait — I have a better idea. Since the other player has many red chips (11) and I need them, and they might want to help me get to the goal quickly because we both share the same goal, maybe I can propose a trade now to get red chips needed for intermediate steps, while leveraging our shared interest in reaching (3,3). But my priority is maximizing my own score.\\n\\nBut note: If I can reach (3,2) safely using the contract (which says they will pay the red chip at (3,2)), then I just need to get to (3,2) first through a legal move.\\n\\nBest path available: (2,2) → (3,2). So if I can get to (2,2), I’m within one step of"
