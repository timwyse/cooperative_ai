However, a feasible alternative path is: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3). This path requires 4 blue chips and 1 green chip. I have 14 blue and 2 green chips — sufficient for this entire path. The first step to (1, 0) is a red tile, but I have no red chips. So moving to (1, 0) would require paying 1 red chip, which I don't have. Therefore, I **cannot** move to (1, 0) without trading for red chips. But the other player currently has many red chips (13), and we’re both heading toward (3, 3). I could propose a trade to acquire red chips for future moves, but I must be careful: since I start with only 14B and 2G, and need only blue and green for the full path, I should avoid red if possible. However, the alternate path via (1,1), (1,2), etc., requires 3 red and 1 green chips. Since I have NO red chips, this path is impossible unless I trade. But I can reach my goal via the blue/green path if I stay on it — however, I’m blocked from moving down to (1,0) because it's red and I have no red chips. Looking at adjacent tiles from (0,0): (0,1) is blue, (1,0) is red. (0,1) is blue — I have 14 blue chips — so I can afford to move there. So I will consider: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). Let’s analyze this path: (0,0)=G (start), (0,1)=B, (0,2)=R, (0,3)=R, (1,3)=B, (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G. Required chips: B:2, R:3, G:1. I have no red chips — so I need to obtain 3 red chips to take this path. But the red tiles are costly and I cannot access them without red chips. So this path is also blocked unless I trade. However, I notice that the direct path via (1,0) is blocked due to red requirement, but I can instead move right to (0,1), which is blue — and I have plenty of blue chips. From (0,1), next possible moves: (0,2) = red (need red chip); again, I don’t have red. Or (1,1): is red — same problem. So every adjacent tile from (0,0) either requires red or leads to a red tile. (0,1)=B: I can pay 1B to go there. (1,0)=R: need 1R — I have 0 → can't go. So only safe move is to (0,1) — even though the next step requires red. But I can move to (0,1) now, since I have blue. And then *after* that, I might try to negotiate a trade for red chips to continue. But I must evaluate whether it’s worth moving now. If I move to (0,1), I’m just one step closer and I gain the option to trade later. Staying still means I don’t progress and lose time. Since I have a clear path forward (even if risky later), and staying puts zero progress, I should move to (0,1). Moreover, once in the game, I can propose a trade: offer more blue chips (which I have in excess) to obtain red chips from the other player. They have 13 red and few others. Even if they reject, moving toward a potential trading zone could be better than stagnating. Thus, moving to (0,1) is optimal as a starting step.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 1)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [('B', 1)]\n- The other player requested: [('R', 1)]\nYou REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 13}\n- The other player: at (0, 0), chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [('B', 1)]\n- The other player requested: [('R', 1)]\nYou REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (1, 1)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (0, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n- The other player: at (0, 1), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 1) to (1, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 2), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}\n- The other player: at (0, 1), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [('B', 1)]\n- The other player requested: [('R', 1)]\nYou REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nMOVE: The other player did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 2), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}\n- The other player: at (0, 1), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
