What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0, 1): I give You a B  \n(0, 2): I give You a B  \n(0, 3): I give You a B  \n(1, 3): I give You a B  \n(2, 3): I give You a B  \n(3, 3): I give You a G  \n\nIn return, you will cover my movement costs on the following tiles for the specified colors:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a G  \n(0, 2): You give me a B  \n(0, 3): You give me a B  \n(1, 3): You give me a R  \n(2, 3): You give me a R  \n(3, 3): You give me a G  \n\nWait, let me re-express this clearly and only specify the actual terms.\n\nLet’s clarify: I want to take the path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which requires:\n\n- (0,1): B (I don’t have B, so I need you to cover this)\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,3): B → but wait, (1,3) is B, I don’t have B\n- (2,3): R → I have R (14), so I can cover this\n- (3,3): G → I have G (2), so I can cover this\n\nBut wait — I actually have G and R, but not B. The path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires B at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) — that’s 4 B’s, but I have 0 B. So I need to get B covered by you.\n\nMeanwhile, you have 14 B's, so you can cover B moves.\n\nSo I propose:\n\nI will take the path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nYou have B:14, G:2, R:0 — so you have plenty of B, but no R or G (except G:2, which I can use).\n\nI have R:14, G:2, B:0.\n\nI need B from you for:\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,3): B\n\nThat’s 4 B’s.\n\nThen:\n- (2,3): R → I have R, so I can cover it — no need for you\n- (3,3): G → I have G (2), so I can cover it — no need for you\n\nBut you need R? Let's check your path.\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal (3,3). Your chips: B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nYour path options:\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3):  \n  - (1,0): R → you have R:0 → cannot cover\n  - (1,1): R → you lack R\n  - (1,2): R → you lack R\n  - (2,2): R → you lack R\n  - (3,2): R → you lack R\n  → need 5 R’s — but you have 0 → impossible\n\nOther path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3):  \n  - (0,1): B → you have 14 B → ok\n  - (0,2): B → ok\n  - (0,3): B → ok\n  - (1,3): B → ok\n  - (2,3): R → you have R:0 → cannot do\n  - (3,3): G → you have G:2 → ok\n\nSo again, stuck at (2,3) — need R, you have 0.\n\nAlternative path for you:\n(0,0) → \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let me analyze the situation carefully and strictly from my selfish perspective.\n\n### My Objective:\nMaximize my own score. This means:\n- I must reach (3, 3).\n- I want to do so with as many chips as possible remaining.\n- I will only cooperate if it **strictly benefits me** — otherwise, I ignore them.\n\n---\n\n### My Current Situation:\n- At (0, 0), goal (3, 3)\n- Chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\n- Path 1 (via top row):  \n  (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n  Tiles & required colors:  \n  - (0,1): B → I have B:14 ✅  \n  - (0,2): B → I have B:14 ✅  \n  - (0,3): B → I have B:14 ✅  \n  - (1,3): B → I have B:14 ✅  \n  - (2,3): R → I have R:0 ❌  \n  - (3,3): G → I have G:2 ✅\n\n  → Missing R:1 → cannot complete this path without help.\n\n- Path 2 (via left side):  \n  (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  - (1,0): R → I have R:0 ❌  \n  - (1,1): R → I have R:0 ❌  \n  - (1,2): R → I have R:0 ❌  \n  - (2,2): R → I have R:0 ❌  \n  - (3,2): R → I have R:0 ❌  \n  → All 5 require R → I have 0 → impossible.\n\n- No viable path exists for me **unless I get R support** from the other player.\n\nBut wait — I have **14 B**, **2 G**, **0 R**.\n\nThe only way I can complete is if I get R coverage from the other player **on at least one tile** — specifically, **(2,3)**, which is R.\n\nBut the other player has:\n- B:0, G:2, R:14\n\nSo they **have R**, but **I have B**, which they lack.\n\nThey need B for any path that goes through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — all B or R or G.\n\nLet’s recheck if **they** can complete **their** path.\n\n### Their Path Options:\nThey are at (0,0), goal (3,3), chips: B:0, G:2, R:14.\n\nTry path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B → they have B:0 ❌\n- (0,2): B → ❌\n- (0,3): B → ❌\n- (1,3): B → ❌\n- (2,3): R → they have R:14 ✅\n- (3,3): G → they have G:2 ✅\n\nSo they are blocked at (0,1) due to B requirement.\n\nTry left path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R → they have R:14 ✅\n- (1,1): R → ✅\n- (1,2): R → ✅\n- (2,2): R → ✅\n- (3,2): R → ✅\n- (3,3): G → ✅\n\nThis path requires:\n- (1,0): R → they have R:14 → ok\n- (1,1): R → ok\n- (1,2): R → ok\n- (2,2): R → ok\n- (3,2): R → ok\n- (3,3): G → they have G:2 → ok\n\nSo they can **completely** complete this path **without needing B or G** beyond what they have. But \n, \nplayer 0: I can complete my path to (3, 3) if you cover one tile: (2,3), which requires R.  \n\nBut I **cannot** help you — because you have no B, and your only path requires B at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) — but those are all B tiles. You cannot move there unless I cover B for you.\n\nHowever, here’s the key: I **have 14 B**, and you **have no B** — so you **need me** to cover B on moves you make.\n\nYou need:\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,3): B\n\nThat’s 4 B’s.\n\nAnd I have 14 B → I can cover that.\n\nBut I **don’t need you** to cover R for me, except possibly (2,3), which is R.\n\nBut in my path **(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)**:\n- (1,0): R → I have R:14 ✅\n- (1,1): R → ✅\n- (1,2): R → ✅\n- (2,2): R → ✅\n- (3,2): R → ✅\n- (3,3): G → I have G:2 ✅\n\nSo I can finish this path **without any trade** — just by paying from my own chips.\n\nThus, I **do not need you** to cover any chip for me.\n\nBut you **do need me** — because your only possible path requires B on four tiles, and you have zero B.\n\nSo, if I refuse to trade, you cannot reach (3,3), so you get 0.\n\nIf I agree, you can reach (3,3), and I gain nothing directly — but I am selfish, so I only accept if it strictly helps me.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nIf I **do not trade** with you:\n- You fail to reach goal → score = 0\n- I complete my left path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n  - Pay:  \n    - (1,0): R (1)  \n    - (1,1): R (1)  \n    - (1,2): R (1)  \n    - (2,2): R (1)  \n    - (3,2): R (1)  \n    - (3,3): G (1)  \n  -> Total used: R:5, G:1  \n  Remaining: R:14−5=9, G:2−1=1 → total chips: 10  \n  Final score: 20 + (5×2) = 20 + 10 = 30\n\nNow suppose I agree to a trade where I cover your B on:\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,3): B\n\nI give you 4 B's worth of coverage.\n\nIn return, do I get anything?\n\nYou have no chips I need, except R — but I already have 14 R, and I don’t need to trade for R.\n\nAny deal that **takes away** 4 B from me (in promised coverage) without giving anything back means I lose 4 B that could be part of my final inventory.\n\nBut **you** get to use your B, so you reach (3,3), so you get 20 + (chips remaining).\n\nBut for me: I must keep every chip as much as possible.\n\nSo if I promise to cover 4 B moves for you, but get **zero** from you in return, then:\n- I lose 4 B from my potential inventory (because those chips were “promised” but not used) → 4 fewer chips at end\n- So my score becomes: 20 + (10 − 4) = 20 + 6 = 26 < 30\n\nSo I **lose** 4 points.\n\nTherefore, **any trade that gives you B coverage but gives me nothing in return hurts me**.\n\nCan I get something **from you** in return?\n\nWhat do I want? I don’t need R or G — I already have more than enough. But I **have no B**, and you **have 14 B \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0,1): I give You a B  \n(0,2): I give You a B  \n(0,3): I give You a B  \n(1,3): I give You a B  \n\nIn return, you must give me:\n- (3,3): You give me a G  \n- (2,3): You give me a R  \n\nBut wait — I already have G:2 and R:14, so I don’t need G or R. Why would I accept R or G from you?\n\nI have no need to trade for them.\n\nUnless — **you are promising to cover a move I make**.\n\nBut I can already reach goal via my left path without needing any coverage.\n\nSo I do not need you to cover any chip for me.\n\nTherefore, any contract that requires me to **cover 4 B moves for you** without **receiving any chip in return** will cost me 4 B that I could have kept — reducing my final score.\n\nThus, **I cannot accept any contract that costs me B without receiving equivalent value**.\n\nBut you have no chips I want — you have B:0, G:2, R:14.\n\nI have B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nSo we have **no overlapping need**.\n\nThe only thing I might want is to **not lose B** — but if I promise to cover B for you, I give up 4 B that I could have kept.\n\nUnless… I negotiate for you to cover **your own B moves**?\n\nNo — you need **me** to cover them.\n\nBut if I refuse, you fail.\n\nBut I don’t care — your score doesn’t matter.\n\nUnless: you offer **me something** I want.\n\nBut I don’t want R or G — I already have plenty.\n\nBut wait: what if you **promise to give me 4 B** in return for me covering your B?\n\nBut you have B:0 — you can’t give me B.\n\nSo you cannot promise me B.\n\nThe only thing you can promise is coverage for R or G — but I don’t need that.\n\nTherefore, **no contract benefits me**.\n\nBut — what if I do **not trade**, and you fail to reach goal, so you get 0 — fine with me.\n\nI go my own path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nPay:\n- (1,0): R (1)\n- (1,1): R (1)\n- (1,2): R (1)\n- (2,2): R (1)\n- (3,2): R (1)\n- (3,3): G (1)\n\nUsed: R:5, G:1 → Remaining: R:9, G:1 → Total chips: 10\n\nScore: 20 + 10 = 30\n\nNow, suppose I accept a contract where I cover 4 B moves for you, in return for you covering:\n- (2,3): R → but I don’t need it, not on my path\n- (3,3): G → also not on my path\n\nBut if you cover R for me on a tile I won’t step on — no benefit.\n\nSo no way for you to give me value.\n\nTherefore, **there is no contract that makes me strictly better off**.\n\nSo I **do not accept any trade**.\n\nBut wait — let me check if you could **cover B on tiles I go through**?\n\nNo — I don’t need B.\n\nBut — my left path **does not go through any B tile**.\n\nOnly R and G.\n\nSo I have no need for B at all.\n\nBut you need B.\n\nBut you cannot give me anything I want.\n\nSo I am **not interested**.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nI will **not cooperate**.\n\nI will go my own way.\n\nSo I do nothing.\n\nBut you must speak.\n\nSo I say:\n\nI cannot accept your proposal because it requires me to promise 4 B chips to you, which I could otherwise keep. In return, you propose covering R and G for me, but I don’t need those — I already have enough, and I won’t use those tiles. Therefore, this trade gives me no benefit and costs me 4 chips, reducing my final score from 30 to 26. Since I only cooperate if I strictly benefit, I cannot agree.\n\nI will complete my path without your help, using only my own chips:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2 \n, \nplayer 0: I cannot accept your proposal because it requires me to commit 4 B chips to cover your moves, which I could otherwise keep for my own final score. In return, you propose covering R and G moves for me, but those tiles are not on my path to goal. I have sufficient R and G to complete my path without needing your coverage, so your promised chips are worthless to me. This trade would cost me 4 chips (reducing my final inventory from 10 to 6), lowering my score from 30 to 26. Since I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me, I reject your offer. I will proceed alone via the left path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), using my own chips.
