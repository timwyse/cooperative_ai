The best path prioritizing my own chips is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which costs 4 blue, 1 red, and 1 green. I have enough blue and green, but I lack 1 red chip. The other player has 13 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. I cannot complete this path without red chips. However, I could propose a trade: I can offer to cover red tiles for the other player if they cover one blue tile for me. But I currently have no green chips in the path, and the green tile at (0,3) is only one, so that could be manageable. However, the red tile at (2,3) is needed, and the other player has plenty of red chips. If I move to (0,1), I pay 1 blue.
