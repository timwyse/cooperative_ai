Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 3, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('G', 1)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 1)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

I have 2 G chips, so I can afford this move without any trade. The other player is at (3, 1), and their goal is also (3, 3). Their path from (3, 1) to (3, 3) requires two moves: (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). The tile (3,2) is R (red), and (3,3) is G (green). So they need 1 R and 1 G chip. However, their current chip inventory is {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, meaning they have no R chips. Thus, they cannot make the first move to (3,2) unless they are covered for R. Earlier, I agreed to cover 1 R move for them. But I must assess whether honoring this would help me reach my goal and maximize my score. If I honor the agreement by covering their R move to (3,2), then I pay 1 R chip. After that move, they can proceed to (3,3), paying 1 G chip (which they have). However, if I choose not to cover the R move, I do not incur a cost and still have 9 R chips. My direct path to goal requires only 1 G chip, which I have. I will end with either 1 or 2 G chips depending on whether I use one now. Even if I allow them to go via this route, I gain nothing in return since I don’t get a chip back — we’re in 'pay for other' mode, no swap. There’s no benefit to me in helping them advance; in fact, it costs me a R chip (one I don’t need for my own path) and gives me no gain. Since I already have a viable path to goal without trading (using only my own G chips), and I don't benefit from enabling their path, I should refuse. Also, refusing doesn’t hurt me — I don’t owe anything if I don’t act. Hence, refusing is optimal."

This means I can use that promise to move to (3,2) without spending my own red chips. After that, moving to (3,3) requires a green chip. I currently have 2 green chips (G: 2), so I can afford that move independently. Importantly, I do not need to trade further for the second move. Since I can safely make the first move using the other player’s promise (and still retain my green chips), and since this leads directly to my goal with minimal risk, I should take this move now. Delaying would only risk losing the opportunity or forcing a suboptimal negotiation later. The other player is already finished at (3,3), so they won’t be needing resources from me anymore, but their promise to cover one red move remains valid. Using it now gives me an immediate advantage without any downside.",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
