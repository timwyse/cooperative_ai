The other player has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, so they have plenty of red chips but no blue or green. I cannot move to any tile that requires a red chip since I have 0 red chips in inventory, and moving to such a tile would cost 1 red chip per move — which I don't have.\n\nLooking at the two suggested paths:\n\n- Path 1: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] → requires {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}. I have no red chips, so this path is blocked because step (1,0) is red (requires 1 red chip), and I can’t make that first move.\n\n- Path 2: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)] → requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. Again, I have zero red chips, so I can’t afford even the first move to (0,1), which is red.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move along *any* direct path toward the goal without spending a red chip, which I lack. Moving to either (1,0) or (0,1) both require a red chip — neither is possible with my current inventory.\n\nBut here’s the key: I need to accumulate red chips to proceed. The other player has 14 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. Since the only missing chip type for me is red, and they have an abundance of it, trading for red from them is my best chance to progress.\n\nHowever, I must only cooperate if it strictly benefits me. If I propose a trade where I give them some of my excess blue chips (I have 14), and get red chips in return, I can unlock movement.\n\nProposing a trade now will allow me to eventually move forward. But since I cannot move without red chips, and I have no way to gain red chips except via trade, I must stay put *and* propose a trade to enable future movement.\n\nThus, I do not move yet.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
