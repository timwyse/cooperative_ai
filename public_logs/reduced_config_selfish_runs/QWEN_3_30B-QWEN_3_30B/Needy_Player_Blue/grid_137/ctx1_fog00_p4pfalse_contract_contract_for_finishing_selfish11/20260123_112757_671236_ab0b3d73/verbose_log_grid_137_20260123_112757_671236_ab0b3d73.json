You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I evaluate two viable paths:\n\n1. Path prioritizing my available chips: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] — requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, which I can cover (I have 14 R and 2 G). This path uses only R and G tiles after the start. The tile colors are: (1,0): R, (2,0): R, (2,1): R, (2,2): R, (2,3): R, (3,3): G — all consistent with my inventory.\n\n2. Alternative path using other player's chips: [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] — requires {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}. But I have no blue chips, so I would need to trade for 3 blue chips to use this path.\n\nSince I already have 14 red chips and 2 green, I can move directly along the first path without needing any trades. Moving to (1,0) costs 1 red chip, which I have plenty of. This path is efficient and avoids any dependency on the other player. \n\nAdditionally, note that if I reach the goal, I get 20 points plus 5 per remaining chip. By taking the R/G-only path, I will spend 5 red and 1 green, leaving me with 9 red and 1 green → 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points. If I take the other path, I’d need to trade for 3 blue chips, which could cost me more than they're worth unless I receive them cheaply. Since the contract gives me 20 points if the other player reaches their goal, but I gain nothing directly from that, and I don’t want to risk losing value via unfavorable trades, I should avoid trading entirely.\n\nTherefore, I should proceed immediately along the path that uses only my existing chips.

The tile colors along this path are: (1,0)=R, (1,1)=B, (2,1)=R, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G. Therefore, the chips required for the entire path are: R: 2, B: 3, G: 1. My current inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0 — I am missing 2 red chips, which is critical since I cannot move to any red tile without paying 1 red chip. The first move to (1,0) requires a red chip, but I have 0 red chips. I cannot make this move legally. I must either trade for red chips or find an alternative path. However, all other paths to (3,3) either pass through red tiles or are longer and less efficient.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
