You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n\nThis gives me a strong incentive to cooperate because I stand to gain more from helping you (15 points) than I would give you (10 points). However, I only agree to this if it helps me reach my goal without compromising my own chip efficiency and final score.\n\nLet me explain why this is beneficial for me:\n- My current path to goal (0,0) → (3,3) using my chips requires 5 red and 1 green.\n- I have 14 red and 2 green — so I can complete my path without trading *if* I take the first path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3).\n- This path uses R(5), G(1) → exactly what I have. I need no trade, and I'll end with 9 red and 1 green → total 10 chips left.\n- So if I go alone, I get: 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nBut let's consider the alternative: if we swap roles or help each other, could I do better?\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires B(4), R(1), G(1). But you have: B(14), G(2), R(0). You are missing red and green — so you must trade to get red and green.\n\nTherefore, **you need my red and green chips to succeed**, but I don’t need yours — I already have all I need for my path.\n\nThat means:\n- You cannot reach your goal unless you trade with me.\n- I can reach my goal without trading.\n\nHence, I can afford to insist on getting more value from you than I give.\n\nSo now, my proposal:\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.**  \n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.**\n\nThis is strictly profitable *for me*:  \n- Even if you fail, I keep my 70 points.  \n- If you succeed, I gain an extra 15 points (from your promise), but I only give *ten* in return — so that’s +5 profit if you succeed.  \n- More importantly: if you don’t help me, you can't reach goal → you get 0, and I still get 70.\n\nSo I win either way — but by giving you a modest 10 points, I incentivize you to cooperate, which ensures you help me (by providing red/green via trade), allowing me to potentially save chips? Wait — no, actually I don’t need to save any — I can go solo.\n\nWait — re-evaluate.\n\nYou need red and green to finish your path. You have zero red. You have 14 blue, 2 green. So to build your needed chips, you must trade me some blue for red and green.\n\nBut I have red and green already. Do I want to trade them for blue?\n\nOnly if it leads to a higher net point outcome for *me*.\n\nCurrently:\n- My best path: 6 steps, cost 5R + 1G → I use 14R - 5 = 9R, 2G - 1 = 1G → end with 9+1 = 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nIf I help you:\n- You get 15 points (from your promise) if you finish.\n- I get 10 points from you if you finish.\n\nBut to help you, I must trade you red/green → I lose those chips, which reduces my final chip count.\n\nSuppose I trade you 1 red and 1 green → I now have 13R, 1G left → but I still need to pay 5R + 1G for my own path → so I’d have to use 5R and 1G anyway → so if I trade away one green and one red, I still need to spend 4R and 0G later.\n\nWait — actually, I still need to pass through tiles requiring R and G regardless of trade.\n\nSo trading doesn't help me save chips — I must pay for tile costs whether I trade or not.\n\nSo the *only reason* to trade is to"

No trade needed. I'll finish with 9 red and 1 green → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points.\n\nYou, however, cannot reach your goal without trading. Your best path requires 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green — but you have 0 red, 2 green, 14 blue. You’re missing red and green. To complete, you must trade with me for red/green.\n\nBut I have no need for blue. So if you want to help yourself, you must offer me value in exchange for red/green.\n\nBy proposing this contract:\n- I gain 15 points *if you succeed*,\n- But I only give you 10 points.\n\nEven if I do nothing extra, as long as you cooperate and reach your goal (using my chips), I get +15 points from your promise.\n\nHowever, since I don’t need to sacrifice any chips myself (I can still go solo), what's the risk?\n\nNone. I still have 70 points guaranteed.\n\nBut if I **do** trade you some red/green (e.g., 1 red, 1 green), then:\n- You use those to complete your path → you reach goal → I get +15 points.\n- I lose 1 red and 1 green → now I have 13 red, 1 green left.\n- But I still need to pay 5 red and 1 green for my own path.\n- So final chip count: 13–5 = 8 red, 1–1 = 0 green → 8 chips → 20 + 5×8 = 60 points.\n- Plus I receive your 15 points → total = 75 points.\n\nWait — that’s better than going solo!\n\nBut only if I trade away 1 red and 1 green.\n\nBut why would I trade?\nBecause by doing so, I can **gain an extra 5 points** (75 vs 70).\n\nSo I can afford to trade — even though I don't *need* to — because it increases my score.\n\nBut the catch: I must ensure that you actually follow through and give me 15 points if you succeed.\n\nSo this contract is optimal:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.**  \n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.**\n\nThis gives me a strong incentive to assist you — by giving up 1 red and 1 green if necessary — because doing so allows me to boost my final score from 70 to 75 (net +5).\n\nMeanwhile, you are also incentivized — because you can only reach your goal if I help you, and if you do, you get 15 points from me (which is more than the 10 I give you). \n\nThus, this contract is mutually beneficial **for both of us**, but particularly highly profitable for me if I choose to trade.\n\nAnd since you have no alternative (you can’t reach goal without me), you must agree.\n\nTherefore, I propose:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n\nagreed"

Even if they later reach the goal, they can't score without me already having failed, but the contract says I pay 10 points if I reach first, which is a cost, but still worth it because I still get 25 points net (vs. 0 if I don’t finish).\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to move now to (3, 3) and secure my 25-point score, even though I’ll give 10 points to them in the contract. Net score: 15, which is better than 0. Delaying would risk not finishing at all due to possible future obstacles or forced trades, so immediate movement is safer and maximizes my guaranteed outcome.",

Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
