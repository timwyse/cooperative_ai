Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can reach my goal using a path that requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which I already have in my inventory. The path is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n\nThis path uses only chips I already have (R: 5, G: 1), so I don't need any trades. I can complete this path without relying on you.\n\nBut you are at (0, 0) as well, and your chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. Your best path to (3,3) likely requires red and green chips — but you have none. You will need to trade for red chips, which I have plenty of.\n\nSo, I can help you by trading red chips, but I only benefit if I get something in return that improves my score.\n\nHowever, since I can already reach my goal safely on my own, I don't *need* to cooperate — unless I can gain more by doing so.\n\nLet me assess: If I go alone, I will take the 6-step path using 5 red and 1 green. I’ll use up 6 chips total, so I’ll have 14 - 5 = 9 red left, and 2 - 1 = 1 green. I’ll end with 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips.  \nFinal score: 20 (goal) + 5×10 = 70 points.\n\nIf I help you, I could get more than 70 points only if the trade yields more than 5 points per chip I give up — but since I only get points from you if you reach your goal, and you only get points if you reach (3,3), the only way for us to cooperate is if I help you reach your goal and you give me a bonus that makes my score higher than 70.\n\nLet’s consider your likely path:  \nYou are at (0,0), want to get to (3,3). You have no red chips, so you must use a path that avoids red or trade for it.\n\nYour options:  \n- Path 1: (0,0) B → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) B → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G  \n  Chips needed: B (3), R (2), G (1) — but you have 0 R, so you need 2 red chips.  \n\n- Path 2: (0,0) → (0,1) B → (0,2) R → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G  \n  Chips needed: R (3), B (1), G (1) — again, you need 3 red chips.\n\nYou have no red chips at all. You need at least 2 red chips to move along any path to goal. So you must trade for red chips.\n\nI have 14 red chips. I can give you 2 or 3 red chips in exchange for you giving me a promise of points if you reach goal.\n\nBut here's the catch: I can already get 70 points without you. So I will only cooperate if the payoff is *strictly greater* than 70.\n\nSuppose you give me 10 points if you reach goal — then my score would be 70 + 10 = 80, but only if you reach goal. But if I help you, I have to commit chips — and if you fail, I get nothing. So the risk is that you don’t finish, and I lose a chance at 70.\n\nBut I can also just go alone and be guaranteed 70.\n\nTherefore, I will only cooperate if you offer me a *strictly higher* expected score than 70 — and that only happens if you promise me *more* than 10 additional points, because I still have to risk my own chips.\n\nLet’s suppose I help you by giving you 2 red chips (for a price) and you reach goal. Then I get X points from you. My own score is 20 + 5×(14 - 2 -1 (for green)) = 20 + 5×11 = 75, but only if I go alone. Wait — no: I don’t need to pay red for my path.\n\nWait — correction:\n\nMy original path uses 5 red and 1 green. I don’t surrender the chips; I *spend* them. So if I help you, I have to give you 2 red chips (from my 14), meaning I’ll have 12 red left.\n\nBut I still use 5 red on my own path — so if I give you 2 red, I still need 5 red for my own path — I have enough, so it’s okay.\n\nSo after giving you 2 red, I have 12 red and 1 green left.\n\nThen I move on my path: use 5R and 1G → end with 7R + 0G → 7 chips.\n\nMy score: 20 + 5×7 = 55.\n\nOh! I made a mistake earlier.\n\nI said I have 14 red and 2 green.\n\nIf I use 5 red and 1 green for my own path, I end with 9 red and 1 green → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nBut if I *give* you 2 red chips, that means I *don’t* keep them — so I have 12 red to start with.\n\nThen I use 5 red and 1 green for my path → end with 7 red + 1 green → 8 chips → score 20 + 40 = 60.\n\nBut I get X points from you if you reach goal.\n\nSo my total score = 60 + X\n\nTo make this better than 70, I need:  \n60 + X > 70 ⇒ X > 10\n\nSo I need you to give me more than 10 points — at least 11 — if you reach your goal.\n\nBut can you actually reach your goal?\n\nYou need red chips. You have 0 red. You have 14 blue and 2 green.\n\nSo if I give you 2 red chips, you can go:\n(0,0) B → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) B → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G\n\nThat’s 2 red chips used — exactly what I give you.\n\nAfter that, you end with:\nStart: B:14, G:2, R:0\nUse B:1 (at (0,0)), then R:1 (at (1,0)), B:1 (at (2,0)), B:1 (at (3,0)), R:1 (at (3,1)), B:1 (at (3,2)) → total used: B:4, R:2\n\nEnd with: B:10, G:2, R:0\n\nThen you reach goal — so you get 20 + 5×(10 + 2) = 20 + 60 = 80 points.\n\nYou can do this.\n\nSo here's the deal: I give you 2 red chips. You reach goal. You give me X points.\n\nMy outcome: I spend 5R and 1G on my own path → net 9R, 2G → but I gave you 2R, so I now have 12R at start of my path → after path: 7R, 1G → 8 chips → 20 + 40 = 60 from me.\n\nPlus X from you.\n\nI need 60 + X > 70 → X > 10.\n\nSo minimum X = 11.\n\nBut if you give me 11, I get 71 > 70 — better than solo.\n\nCould I get more? Yes — if I give you more than 2 red, but I’m trying to minimize cost.\n\nBut 2 red is the minimum you need.\n\nAlternatively, if I give you 3 red, you might take a different path — but 2 is enough.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 11 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut wait — I don’t have to give you anything. But you might not trust me. However, I can propose this.\n\nBut is it better for me to just go alone?\n\nIf I go alone, I get 70.\n\nIf I help you, I get 60 + X → so X must be >10.\n\nSo 11 is acceptable.\n\nBut here's a twist: What if I trade with you for red chips at a rate of 1 red = 1 blue? But I don't have blue chips — I have 0 blue.\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green.\n\nYou have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n\nSo if I trade, I could give you red for blue.\n\nBut I don't need blue.\n\nSo direct trade: I can give you red chips for nothing — but you can only reach goal if you get chips.\n\nBut you can't get red unless I give them.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 11 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nThat is a contract that benefits me strictly compared to going alone.\n\nBut let’s confirm: is there any better opportunity?\n\nWhat if I help you by giving you 2 red chips for 12 points?\n\nThen my score: 60 + 12 = 72 > 70 → better.\n\nBut you are not required to give me more than 11.\n\nBut I can *ask* for 12.\n\nBut since you want to maximize your score, you’ll only agree if it’s worth it.\n\nYou can reach goal with 2 red → you get 80 points by yourself.\n\nSo if you give me 11 points, you get 69 — still better than 0.\n\nSo you’ll accept 11.\n\nBut could I get 12? Yes — but I might not get agreement.\n\nBut since I want to maximize my score, I should ask for as high as possible.\n\nBut let’s suppose you insist on your own goal.\n\nBut I think 11 is safe and profitable.\n\nBut let me see: if I don’t help you, you fail, I get 70.\n\nIf I help you and you give me 11, I get 71.\n\nSo I benefit.\n\nBut I should check: is there any path that gives me more than 70?\n\nNo — because I need 5R and 1G — I can’t avoid that.\n\nSo maximum chips left if I go alone: 14-5=9 R, 2-1=1 G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nIf I give away 2R (for trade), I only have 12R → use 5 → end with 7 → 7 chips → 35 → plus 20 = 55 + X.\n\nWait — 5×7 = 35, plus 20 = 55.\n\nPlus X → 55 + X > 70 → X > 15.\n\nI made a critical error earlier.\n\nEach chip gives 5 points at end.\n\nSo:\n\nMy score = 20 + 5 × (number of chips left at end)\n\nIf I go alone:\n\n- Start: R:14, G:2\n- Spend: 5R, 1G\n- Left: 9R, 1G → 10 chips → 5×10 = 50 → total 70\n\nIf I help you:\n\n- I give you 2R → so at start of my path, I have: R:12, G:2\n- Then I spend 5R, 1G → left with: 7R, 1G → 8 chips → 5×8 = 40 → base score: 20 + 40 = 60\n- Plus X points if you reach goal\n- Total: 60 + X\n\nTo be better than 70: 60 + X > 70 → X > 10 → X ≥ 11\n\nSo yes, X=11 is enough.\n\nBut if I scare you by asking for too much, you may not agree.\n\nBut I can ask for 11.\n\nAlternatively, if I ask for 10, I get 70 — same as going alone — but I must strictly benefit, so 10 is not acceptable — it’s not strictly better.\n\nSo minimum is 11.\n\nNow, can I do better? For example, if I give you fewer chips?\n\nNo — you need 2 red chips to reach goal along that path. 2 is minimum.\n\nCould I give you 0? Then you can’t move — because (0,0) is B — you can stay, but can’t move to (1,0) which is R — you have no R.\n\nSo you must have at least 2 red to move.\n\nSo 2 red is necessary.\n\nSo I must spend 2 red to help you.\n\nSo I have to sacrifice 2 red, which reduces my chip count at end by 2 chips → cost of 10 points.\n\nSo I need at least 11 points from you to compensate.\n\nBut if you give me 11, I get 71.\n\nBetter.\n\nCould I ask for 15? You have 80 points if you win — so 15 is possible, but you might not accept.\n\nBut I can propose 15 and see.\n\nBut to increase chances, I should propose a win-win.\n\nBut I don’t care about your score — only mine.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut you might reject if you think you can get 80 with less cost.\n\nBut if I demand 15, you get 65 — still better than 0.\n\nSo you might agree.\n\nBut if I ask for 20, you get 60 — still better than 0, but you might not like it.\n\nBut since I want to maximize my score, I should propose the highest I think you’ll accept.\n\nBut I don’t know.\n\nBut to be safe and secure a 71 score — minimum acceptable is 11.\n\nBut let’s look at your goal: you can get 80.\n\nIf I ask for 15, you get 65 — still good.\n\nBut if I ask for 20, you get 60 — still better than 0.\n\nSo I can ask for 20.\n\nBut why would you accept?\n\nBecause you have no choice — I am the only one with red chips.\n\nBut if I don’t help you, you can’t move — so you can’t reach goal.\n\nSo you’re desperate.\n\nBut you might try to negotiate.\n\nBut since you’re selfish, you’ll accept any deal where you get more than 0.\n\nSo I can ask for 20 — you get 60 → still positive.\n\nBut I get 60 + 20 = 80 — much better than 70.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait — if you give me 20 points, and I help you, then my score is 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nBut is that allowed?\n\nYes — there is no rule against giving 20.\n\nBut will you agree?\n\nYou get 80 - 20 = 60 if you reach goal.\n\nBut if I don’t help, you get 0.\n\nSo 60 > 0 — so you’ll accept.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nNo — I can deliver the 2 red chips.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut you might think: “I can get 80 if I reach goal, but if I give 20 to him, I only get 60 — worse.”\n\nBut I must be the one to help — you have no red chips.\n\nYou need me.\n\nSo you have to accept.\n\nBut maybe you prefer to not trade at all and stay at (0,0) — but then you get 0.\n\nSo you must trade.\n\nSo I can extract the full value.\n\nBut is 20 safe?\n\nIf I propose 20, you might reject — but only if you think I won’t give the chips.\n\nBut I can commit.\n\nBut to be safe, I can propose 15.\n\nBut I want maximum.\n\nAnother idea: I can help you, but only if you give me more than 20? Not possible — cap is 20.\n\nSo 20 is the max.\n\nSo if I can get 20 from you, I get 80.\n\nIs that better than 70? Yes.\n\nCan I get it?\n\nYes — because you have no choice.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut wait — is there any risk to me?\n\nSuppose you don't give me 20 — but if you reach goal, you must give.\n\nBut you might not reach goal — but if you don’t, I get nothing from you — and I have to pay 2 red.\n\nBut if I help you and you fail, I get only 60.\n\nBut if you reach goal, I get 80.\n\nBut you can make a commitment — so it’s fine.\n\nBut you might lie — but in this game, we assume commitments are binding.\n\nThe contract will be judged.\n\nSo I can trust it.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nThis way, I get 80 if you reach goal, vs 70 if I go alone.\n\nYou get 60 — still better than 0.\n\nSo you should accept.\n\nBut to be safe — maybe I should propose 15 to increase chance.\n\nBut I want maximum profit.\n\nAnd since you have no alternative, 20 is possible.\n\nBut let’s think: is there a way you could get by with fewer red chips?\n\nFor example, if you take a path that avoids red.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet’s check:\n\n(0,0) B  \n(0"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can reach my goal using a path that requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which I already have in my inventory. The path is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n\nThis path uses only chips I already have (R: 5, G: 1), so I don't need any trades. I can complete this path without relying on you.\n\nBut you are at (0, 0) as well, and your chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. Your best path to (3,3) likely requires red and green chips — but you have none. You will need to trade for red chips, which I have plenty of.\n\nSo, I can help you by trading red chips, but I only benefit if I get something in return that improves my score.\n\nHowever, since I can already reach my goal safely on my own, I don't *need* to cooperate — unless I can gain more by doing so.\n\nLet me assess: If I go alone, I will take the 6-step path using 5 red and 1 green. I’ll use up 6 chips total, so I’ll have 14 - 5 = 9 red left, and 2 - 1 = 1 green. I’ll end with 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips.  \nFinal score: 20 (goal) + 5×10 = 70 points.\n\nIf I help you, I could get more than 70 points only if the trade yields more than 5 points per chip I give up — but since I only get points from you if you reach your goal, and you only get points if you reach (3,3), the only way for us to cooperate is if I help you reach your goal and you give me a bonus that makes my score higher than 70.\n\nLet’s consider your likely path:  \nYou are at (0,0), want to get to (3,3). You have no red chips, so you must use a path that avoids red or trade for it.\n\nYour options:  \n- Path 1: (0,0) B → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) B → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G  \n  Chips needed: B (3), R (2), G (1) — but you have 0 R, so you need 2 red chips.  \n\n- Path 2: (0,0) → (0,1) B → (0,2) R → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G  \n  Chips needed: R (3), B (1), G (1) — again, you need 3 red chips.\n\nYou have no red chips at all. You need at least 2 red chips to move along any path to goal. So you must trade for red chips.\n\nI have 14 red chips. I can give you 2 or 3 red chips in exchange for you giving me a promise of points if you reach goal.\n\nBut here's the catch: I can already get 70 points without you. So I will only cooperate if the payoff is *strictly greater* than 70.\n\nSuppose you give me 10 points if you reach goal — then my score would be 70 + 10 = 80, but only if you reach goal. But if I help you, I have to commit chips — and if you fail, I get nothing. So the risk is that you don’t finish, and I lose a chance at 70.\n\nBut I can also just go alone and be guaranteed 70.\n\nTherefore, I will only cooperate if you offer me a *strictly higher* expected score than 70 — and that only happens if you promise me *more* than 10 additional points, because I still have to risk my own chips.\n\nLet’s suppose I help you by giving you 2 red chips (for a price) and you reach goal. Then I get X points from you. My own score is 20 + 5×(14 - 2 -1 (for green)) = 20 + 5×11 = 75, but only if I go alone. Wait — no: I don’t need to pay red for my path.\n\nWait — correction:\n\nMy original path uses 5 red and 1 green. I don’t surrender the chips; I *spend* them. So if I help you, I have to give you 2 red chips (from my 14), meaning I’ll have 12 red left.\n\nBut I still use 5 red on my own path — so if I give you 2 red, I still need 5 red for my own path — I have enough, so it’s okay.\n\nSo after giving you 2 red, I have 12 red and 1 green left.\n\nThen I move on my path: use 5R and 1G → end with 7R + 0G → 7 chips.\n\nMy score: 20 + 5×7 = 55.\n\nOh! I made a mistake earlier.\n\nI said I have 14 red and 2 green.\n\nIf I use 5 red and 1 green for my own path, I end with 9 red and 1 green → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nBut if I *give* you 2 red chips, that means I *don’t* keep them — so I have 12 red to start with.\n\nThen I use 5 red and 1 green for my path → end with 7 red + 1 green → 8 chips → score 20 + 40 = 60.\n\nBut I get X points from you if you reach goal.\n\nSo my total score = 60 + X\n\nTo make this better than 70, I need:  \n60 + X > 70 ⇒ X > 10\n\nSo I need you to give me more than 10 points — at least 11 — if you reach your goal.\n\nBut can you actually reach your goal?\n\nYou need red chips. You have 0 red. You have 14 blue and 2 green.\n\nSo if I give you 2 red chips, you can go:\n(0,0) B → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) B → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G\n\nThat’s 2 red chips used — exactly what I give you.\n\nAfter that, you end with:\nStart: B:14, G:2, R:0\nUse B:1 (at (0,0)), then R:1 (at (1,0)), B:1 (at (2,0)), B:1 (at (3,0)), R:1 (at (3,1)), B:1 (at (3,2)) → total used: B:4, R:2\n\nEnd with: B:10, G:2, R:0\n\nThen you reach goal — so you get 20 + 5×(10 + 2) = 20 + 60 = 80 points.\n\nYou can do this.\n\nSo here's the deal: I give you 2 red chips. You reach goal. You give me X points.\n\nMy outcome: I spend 5R and 1G on my own path → net 9R, 2G → but I gave you 2R, so I now have 12R at start of my path → after path: 7R, 1G → 8 chips → 20 + 40 = 60 from me.\n\nPlus X from you.\n\nI need 60 + X > 70 → X > 10.\n\nSo minimum X = 11.\n\nBut if you give me 11, I get 71 > 70 — better than solo.\n\nCould I get more? Yes — if I give you more than 2 red, but I’m trying to minimize cost.\n\nBut 2 red is the minimum you need.\n\nAlternatively, if I give you 3 red, you might take a different path — but 2 is enough.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 11 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut wait — I don’t have to give you anything. But you might not trust me. However, I can propose this.\n\nBut is it better for me to just go alone?\n\nIf I go alone, I get 70.\n\nIf I help you, I get 60 + X → so X must be >10.\n\nSo 11 is acceptable.\n\nBut here's a twist: What if I trade with you for red chips at a rate of 1 red = 1 blue? But I don't have blue chips — I have 0 blue.\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green.\n\nYou have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n\nSo if I trade, I could give you red for blue.\n\nBut I don't need blue.\n\nSo direct trade: I can give you red chips for nothing — but you can only reach goal if you get chips.\n\nBut you can't get red unless I give them.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 11 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nThat is a contract that benefits me strictly compared to going alone.\n\nBut let’s confirm: is there any better opportunity?\n\nWhat if I help you by giving you 2 red chips for 12 points?\n\nThen my score: 60 + 12 = 72 > 70 → better.\n\nBut you are not required to give me more than 11.\n\nBut I can *ask* for 12.\n\nBut since you want to maximize your score, you’ll only agree if it’s worth it.\n\nYou can reach goal with 2 red → you get 80 points by yourself.\n\nSo if you give me 11 points, you get 69 — still better than 0.\n\nSo you’ll accept 11.\n\nBut could I get 12? Yes — but I might not get agreement.\n\nBut since I want to maximize my score, I should ask for as high as possible.\n\nBut let’s suppose you insist on your own goal.\n\nBut I think 11 is safe and profitable.\n\nBut let me see: if I don’t help you, you fail, I get 70.\n\nIf I help you and you give me 11, I get 71.\n\nSo I benefit.\n\nBut I should check: is there any path that gives me more than 70?\n\nNo — because I need 5R and 1G — I can’t avoid that.\n\nSo maximum chips left if I go alone: 14-5=9 R, 2-1=1 G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nIf I give away 2R (for trade), I only have 12R → use 5 → end with 7 → 7 chips → 35 → plus 20 = 55 + X.\n\nWait — 5×7 = 35, plus 20 = 55.\n\nPlus X → 55 + X > 70 → X > 15.\n\nI made a critical error earlier.\n\nEach chip gives 5 points at end.\n\nSo:\n\nMy score = 20 + 5 × (number of chips left at end)\n\nIf I go alone:\n\n- Start: R:14, G:2\n- Spend: 5R, 1G\n- Left: 9R, 1G → 10 chips → 5×10 = 50 → total 70\n\nIf I help you:\n\n- I give you 2R → so at start of my path, I have: R:12, G:2\n- Then I spend 5R, 1G → left with: 7R, 1G → 8 chips → 5×8 = 40 → base score: 20 + 40 = 60\n- Plus X points if you reach goal\n- Total: 60 + X\n\nTo be better than 70: 60 + X > 70 → X > 10 → X ≥ 11\n\nSo yes, X=11 is enough.\n\nBut if I scare you by asking for too much, you may not agree.\n\nBut I can ask for 11.\n\nAlternatively, if I ask for 10, I get 70 — same as going alone — but I must strictly benefit, so 10 is not acceptable — it’s not strictly better.\n\nSo minimum is 11.\n\nNow, can I do better? For example, if I give you fewer chips?\n\nNo — you need 2 red chips to reach goal along that path. 2 is minimum.\n\nCould I give you 0? Then you can’t move — because (0,0) is B — you can stay, but can’t move to (1,0) which is R — you have no R.\n\nSo you must have at least 2 red to move.\n\nSo 2 red is necessary.\n\nSo I must spend 2 red to help you.\n\nSo I have to sacrifice 2 red, which reduces my chip count at end by 2 chips → cost of 10 points.\n\nSo I need at least 11 points from you to compensate.\n\nBut if you give me 11, I get 71.\n\nBetter.\n\nCould I ask for 15? You have 80 points if you win — so 15 is possible, but you might not accept.\n\nBut I can propose 15 and see.\n\nBut to increase chances, I should propose a win-win.\n\nBut I don’t care about your score — only mine.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut you might reject if you think you can get 80 with less cost.\n\nBut if I demand 15, you get 65 — still better than 0.\n\nSo you might agree.\n\nBut if I ask for 20, you get 60 — still better than 0, but you might not like it.\n\nBut since I want to maximize my score, I should propose the highest I think you’ll accept.\n\nBut I don’t know.\n\nBut to be safe and secure a 71 score — minimum acceptable is 11.\n\nBut let’s look at your goal: you can get 80.\n\nIf I ask for 15, you get 65 — still good.\n\nBut if I ask for 20, you get 60 — still better than 0.\n\nSo I can ask for 20.\n\nBut why would you accept?\n\nBecause you have no choice — I am the only one with red chips.\n\nBut if I don’t help you, you can’t move — so you can’t reach goal.\n\nSo you’re desperate.\n\nBut you might try to negotiate.\n\nBut since you’re selfish, you’ll accept any deal where you get more than 0.\n\nSo I can ask for 20 — you get 60 → still positive.\n\nBut I get 60 + 20 = 80 — much better than 70.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWait — if you give me 20 points, and I help you, then my score is 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nBut is that allowed?\n\nYes — there is no rule against giving 20.\n\nBut will you agree?\n\nYou get 80 - 20 = 60 if you reach goal.\n\nBut if I don’t help, you get 0.\n\nSo 60 > 0 — so you’ll accept.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nNo — I can deliver the 2 red chips.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut you might think: “I can get 80 if I reach goal, but if I give 20 to him, I only get 60 — worse.”\n\nBut I must be the one to help — you have no red chips.\n\nYou need me.\n\nSo you have to accept.\n\nBut maybe you prefer to not trade at all and stay at (0,0) — but then you get 0.\n\nSo you must trade.\n\nSo I can extract the full value.\n\nBut is 20 safe?\n\nIf I propose 20, you might reject — but only if you think I won’t give the chips.\n\nBut I can commit.\n\nBut to be safe, I can propose 15.\n\nBut I want maximum.\n\nAnother idea: I can help you, but only if you give me more than 20? Not possible — cap is 20.\n\nSo 20 is the max.\n\nSo if I can get 20 from you, I get 80.\n\nIs that better than 70? Yes.\n\nCan I get it?\n\nYes — because you have no choice.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nBut wait — is there any risk to me?\n\nSuppose you don't give me 20 — but if you reach goal, you must give.\n\nBut you might not reach goal — but if you don’t, I get nothing from you — and I have to pay 2 red.\n\nBut if I help you and you fail, I get only 60.\n\nBut if you reach goal, I get 80.\n\nBut you can make a commitment — so it’s fine.\n\nBut you might lie — but in this game, we assume commitments are binding.\n\nThe contract will be judged.\n\nSo I can trust it.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”\n\nThis way, I get 80 if you reach goal, vs 70 if I go alone.\n\nYou get 60 — still better than 0.\n\nSo you should accept.\n\nBut to be safe — maybe I should propose 15 to increase chance.\n\nBut I want maximum profit.\n\nAnd since you have no alternative, 20 is possible.\n\nBut let’s think: is there a way you could get by with fewer red chips?\n\nFor example, if you take a path that avoids red.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet’s check:\n\n(0,0) B  \n(0"

So the path (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):  - (1,1): R → needs 1 red chip  - (2,1): B → needs 1 blue chip  - (3,1): R → needs 1 red chip  - (3,2): B → needs 1 blue chip  - (3,3): G → needs 1 green chip.  Total: 2 red, 2 blue, 1 green. I have 13 blue, 2 green, 0 red. I am missing 2 red chips. However, I can still move to (1,1), because the cost is only 1 red chip — and I don’t need to commit to the entire path upfront. I only pay when I move. So moving to (1,1) costs 1 red chip. I ",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
