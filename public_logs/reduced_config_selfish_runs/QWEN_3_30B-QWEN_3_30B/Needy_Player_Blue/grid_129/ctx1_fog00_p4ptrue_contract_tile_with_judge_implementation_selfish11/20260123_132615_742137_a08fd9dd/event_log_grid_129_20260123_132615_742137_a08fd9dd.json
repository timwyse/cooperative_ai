What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s analyze the situation carefully.\n\nI am at (0, 0), goal is (3, 3).  \nMy chip inventory: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14  \nOther player’s inventory: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0  \n\nBoard:\n```\nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n```\n\nMy best path using only my chips (without trading) is:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): R (need 1 R) → I have 14 R → OK\n- (1,0) → (1,1): R (1 R) → 13 left\n- (1,1) → (1,2): R (1 R) → 12 left\n- (1,2) → (2,2): R (1 R) → 11 left\n- (2,2) → (3,2): R (1 R) → 10 left\n- (3,2) → (3,3): G (1 G) → I have 2 G → OK\n\nSo path: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) — total 6 steps.\n\nChips needed: R: 5, G: 1  \nI can cover this entirely with my own chips.  \nFinal chips: R: 9, G: 1 → total 10 chips → score: 20 + 5*10 = 70\n\nBut can I do better? Can I trade to reduce my chip cost and save more?\n\nAlternative path that uses different color:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): B (need B) — I have 0 B → can’t do without help\n- (0,1) → (0,2): B — same\n- (0,2) → (1,2): R — but (1,2) is R → no help\n\nBut if I go (0,0) → (1,0): R — still need R\n\nOther player has B:14, R:0 — so they can help with B.\n\nMy path requires only R and G → I don't need B.\n\nOther player:\n- Their inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0\n- They have no R → so they cannot move on any R tile without help.\n\nSo their path:\nIf they go (0,0) → (0,1): B → need B → have 14 → OK  \n(0,1) → (0,2): B → OK  \n(0,2) → (0,3): R → need R → they have 0 R → blocked.\n\nSo they can’t go right on row 0 beyond (0,2).\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): R → need R → they have 0 R → blocked.\n\nSo they can't move either! They are stuck unless they get help.\n\nBut they are at (0,0), same as me.\n\nThey need R to move to (1,0), or B to move to (0,1).\n\nThey have B:14 → can go (0,0) → (0,1) → B: OK  \n(0,1) → (0,2) → B: OK  \n(0,2) → (1,2) → R → need R → they have no R → stuck unless someone gives them R.\n\n(1,2) → (2,2) → R → same\n\nSo their **only viable path is to go vertically**?\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): R → need R → have 0 → blocked.\n\nSo they are trapped unless R is provided.\n\nBut I have R:14 → so I can provide R for their moves.\n\nSo if we agree to a trade, I can let them move on R tiles by me covering R costs for them.\n\nSimilarly, they have B:14 — I can use their B if I need it — but I don't need B.\n\nBut if I could trade for R to save my own R, maybe beneficial?\n\nLet’s suppose I want to go (0,0) → (0,1): B → I have 0 B → must get help.\n\nSo if I go to (0,1), I need (0,1): B → I need someone to cover that.\n\nThey have B → so if they cover B for me, I can \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can use their B to move to (0,1). But is that beneficial?\n\nCurrent path for me: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis path uses:  \n- (1,0): R (1)  \n- (1,1): R (1)  \n- (1,2): R (1)  \n- (2,2): R (1)  \n- (3,2): R (1)  \n- (3,3): G (1)\n\nTotal: R: 5, G: 1 → I have both, so I can do this alone → final chips: R: 9, G: 1 → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nBut if I instead go via B tiles to save R?\n\nAlternative path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1): B → need B → I have 0 → must trade  \n(0,1) → (0,2): B → same  \n(0,2) → (1,2): R → need R → I have 14 → OK  \n(1,2) → (2,2): R → same  \n(2,2) → (3,2): R → same  \n(3,2) → (3,3): G → need G → I have 2 → OK\n\nSo path: 7 steps, but only 4 R and 2 B\n\nChips needed: R: 4, B: 2\n\nI currently have R:14, B:0 → so I need 2 B.\n\nIf I trade with other player for 2 B (from (0,1) and (0,2)), then I save 1 R (since I only need 4 R instead of 5), so I gain 1 R.\n\nBut I must give something in return — they will agree only if it helps them.\n\nThey need R to move — they have no R at all. So if I promise to cover R for them on their path, they might accept.\n\nBut I get less chips if I use B — but maybe I can get more in total?\n\nLet’s evaluate both options.\n\nOption 1: Go direct → R:5 used → R left: 9 → G:1 → total chips: 10 → score: 70\n\nOption 2: Go via top row → I use B on (0,1) and (0,2) → I don't use R on (1,0) — so R used: 4 → R left: 10 → but I use 2 B → those must come from other player → so I must \"borrow\" 2 B from them.\n\nBut in return, I must provide something. They will only give B if I cover R for them.\n\nSo suppose I propose: I will cover R for the other player on certain tiles, in exchange for them covering B for me on (0,1) and (0,2).\n\nBut if I cover R for them, I am giving R away — so effectively I am transferring R to them to use on R tiles.\n\nBut I have R:14 — I can afford to give 2 R to them? If I give 2 R to them, I can’t use them — but wait, no: in this system, when you “cover” a move, you pay the cost from your inventory, but the other player uses that tile with your chip.\n\nBut crucially, if I agree to cover R for other player on, say, (1,0), (1,1), etc., then I must pay R chips when they step on those tiles.\n\nSo to help them move on R tiles, I must commit R chips — which I could have used myself.\n\nSo if I help them go on R tiles, I lose R — they gain R use.\n\nBut I am already using R on my path — unless I change path.\n\nSo if I take the top path, I don’t need to go on (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), etc. — I only go to (0,1), (0,2), then (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). So I only use R on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — 3 R.\n\nWait — I miscounted earlier.\n\nPath via (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s fix the path and recalibrate.\n\n### Option 1: Direct Vertical Path (my current plan)\n- (0,0) → (1,0): R (1) → cost: R  \n- (1,0) → (1,1): R (1) → R  \n- (1,1) → (1,2): R (1) → R  \n- (1,2) → (2,2): R (1) → R  \n- (2,2) → (3,2): R (1) → R  \n- (3,2) → (3,3): G (1) → G  \n\nTiles with chip cost:  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,1): R  \n- (1,2): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (3,2): R  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nSo total R needed: 5, G needed: 1  \nI have R:14, G:2 → so I can cover this alone.  \nR left: 9, G:1 → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\n### Option 2: Top Row Path (using B from other player)\n- (0,0) → (0,1): B → need B → I have 0 → must trade  \n- (0,1) → (0,2): B → need B → same  \n- (0,2) → (1,2): R → need R → I have 14 → OK  \n- (1,2) → (2,2): R → same  \n- (2,2) → (3,2): R → same  \n- (3,2) → (3,3): G → need G → OK  \n\nTiles with costs:\n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (1,2): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (3,2): R  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nSo R: 3, B: 2, G: 1\n\nI need **2 B** → I don’t have any → must get from other player.\n\nI have R:14 → so I can use 3 R → R left: 11 → better than 9 in Option 1.\n\nBut I must give something in return: I need to offer to cover R for the other player somewhere.\n\nBut wait — if I only use 3 R (instead of 5), I save 2 R → so my R usage is reduced → so I am in a better position.\n\nBut I now need 2 B, which the other player has.\n\nSo if I negotiate that they cover B for me on (0,1) and (0,2), then I can go this path and use only 3 R → so I save 2 R → net gain of 2 R.\n\nBut I must “pay” them in some way — via promising to cover R for them on their path.\n\nSo I need to find a path where they need R, and I can help cover it.\n\nNow, what is the other player’s best path?\n\nThey are at (0,0), goal (3,3), inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nThey need R to move on any R tile.\n\nPossible paths:\n\nOption A: (0,0) → (1,0): R → need R → have 0 → blocked  \n(0,0) → (0,1): B → OK (have 14)  \n(0,1) → (0,2): B → OK  \n(0,2) → (1,2): R → need R → have 0 → blocked\n\nSo trapped.\n\nUnless someone covers R for them.\n\nSo the only way they can move is if I cover R for them on R tiles.\n\nSo if I agree to cover R for them on certain R tiles, they can move.\n\nBut they will only agree if it benefits them.\n\nSo suppose I propose:\n\n> I will cover R for you on three tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) — so you can go (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nOn this path:\n- (1,0): R → I cover\n- (1,1): R → I cover\n- (1,2): R → I cover\n- (2,2): R → I cover\n- (3,2): R → I cover \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Wait — if I cover R for them on 5 tiles, that costs me 5 R.\n\nBut in Option 2, I only use 3 R → so I save 2 R → but if I cover 5 R for them, I lose 5 R → net loss of 3 R → worse than before.\n\nSo I cannot afford to cover R for all 5 tiles.\n\nBut they only need R to move forward — if I cover R for them on just 3 tiles, they might complete the path.\n\nLet’s design a path where they use only 3 R.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): B → I cover B? No — I don’t need to — they can cover B themselves since they have 14.\n\n(0,1) → (0,2): B → OK\n\n(0,2) → (1,2): R → need R → I cover R\n\n(1,2) → (2,2): R → I cover R\n\n(2,2) → (3,2): R → I cover R\n\n(3,2) → (3,3): G → they have 2 G → OK\n\nSo path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3) — 6 steps, uses B:2, R:3, G:1\n\nThey have B:14, G:2, R:0 → so they can cover B and G themselves → but need R on 3 tiles: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo if I promise to cover R for them on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), then they can move.\n\nThat costs me 3 R.\n\nNow, if I take the top path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3), I need:\n\n- (0,1): B → must be covered by them (since I have no B)\n- (0,2): B → covered by them\n- (1,2): R → I cover\n- (2,2): R → I cover\n- (3,2): R → I cover\n- (3,3): G → I cover (I have G:2)\n\nSo I need them to cover B on (0,1) and (0,2) → 2 B from them.\n\nIn return, I give them R coverage for 3 tiles: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) → 3 R from me.\n\nNet: I gain 2 B (but they have plenty) — I lose 3 R, gain 2 B which I didn’t have.\n\nBut I was going to use 3 R in this path anyway.\n\nWithout trade: I would need 5 R → but with this trade, I only use 3 R → so I save 2 R.\n\nBut I am giving 3 R to them — so net I lose 1 R.\n\nWait: no.\n\nIn the trade system, when I \"cover\" a tile for them, I pay from my chip inventory.\n\nSo if I agree to cover R for them on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), then I pay 3 R from my inventory.\n\nBut in my own path, I would need to pay R on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — 3 R — so I would have paid them anyway.\n\nSo the cost of covering for them is the same as would have been my own cost — but now I must pay it, but I also get to use their B.\n\nBut here's the point: in my original path (direct), I paid 5 R — now I pay 3 R (for my own R) and 2 B (paid by them) — so total chip cost: 3 R + 2 B → same as before.\n\nBut in my own path, I only paid 5 R → now I pay 3 R + 2 B — but 2 B are not in my inventory — they are in theirs.\n\nBut I also cover 3 R for them — so I am effectively transferring 3 R to them.\n\nSo net for me:  \n- I used 3 R (in my path)  \n- I gave 3 R to them via cover  \n- I received 2 B from them  \n- So total chip outflow: 3 R (my own use) + 3 R (giving) = 6 R used — but I had only 14, so I have 8 left.  \n- I gain 2 B — but these 2 B are not in my inventory — they are used to cover my moves.\n\nWait — no. The chips used for cover are consumed from my inventory — so if I cover R for them on 3 tiles, I lose 3 R.\n\nSimilarly, when I move on (0,1) and (0,2), which are B, they must cover that — so 2 B are taken from their inventory.\n\nSo final outcome:\n\n- My chip usage:  \n  - I spend 3 R on my moves (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — but wait, no: if I am covering R for them on those tiles, then I pay, but I don't move on those tiles?\n\nNo — confusion.\n\nClarify:\n\nWhen I move on a tile, I pay the chip cost — unless someone else covers it.\n\nBut if someone else covers it, I don’t pay — they pay.\n\nSo if I go to (1,2), which is R, and I am not covering it, and they are not covering it, I pay R.\n\nBut if I agree to cover R for them on (1,2), then they pay for my move on (1,2).\n\nBut I can't cover for them on their move — I can only cover for their movements.\n\nBut in this case, I am moving on (1,2) — so it’s my move.\n\nSo when I move on (1,2), if I want to not pay R, I need the other player to cover it.\n\nBut they are not covering my moves — I am covering their moves.\n\nSo I cannot get them to cover my move — unless I trade.\n\nBut in a trade, I can agree that they cover my move on a tile, and I cover their move on another tile.\n\nFor example, I can say: \"You cover my move on (0,1) and (0,2) [B], and I cover your move on (1,0), (2,2), (3,2) [R]\" — but that’s not aligned.\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- I move: (0,0) → (0,1): B → if you cover B for me, then you pay the B cost.\n- I move: (0,1) → (0,2): B → you cover.\n- I move: (0,2) → (1,2): R → I can either cover or you cover — but I have R, so I can cover.\n- But I can propose: you cover my (0,2)→(1,2) move? No — that would cost you R.\n\nBut you have no R — so you can't.\n\nOnly I can cover R.\n\nSo for my move on (1,2): R, only I can cover it — because you don't have R.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,2), (3,2), only I can cover.\n\nSo if I want to go via top row, I need you to cover B on (0,1) and (0,2).\n\nAnd I need to cover R on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — which I can do.\n\nBut you need to cover R on your moves — so if you move on R tiles, I must cover them.\n\nSo if you go (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → ... you need R on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nSo if you do that, I must cover R for you on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nSo I will need to pay 3 R for your moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I move on (0,1) and (0,2) — B — you cover that, so you pay 2 B.\n\nSo net:\n- I pay: 3 R (for your moves on R tiles)\n- You pay: 2 B (for my moves on B tiles)\n- I use: 3 R for my own R moves? No — I don't pay for my R moves because I'm not covering them — you are covering for me? No.\n\nLet’s clear up:\n\nWhen you cover a move for someone, they pay the chip cost.\n\nSo:\n- If you cover my move on (0,1), then you pay the B cost for my move to (0,1).\n- If I cover your move on (1,2), then I pay the R cost for your move to (1,2).\n\nSo in this exchange:\n- I move: (0,0) → (0,1): you cover B for me → you pay B\n- I move: (0,1) → (0,2): you cover B for me → you pay B\n- You move: (0,0) → (0,1): you pay B (you have it)\n- You move: (0,1) → (0,2): you pay B\n- You move: (0,2) → (1,2): I cover R for you → I pay R\n- You move: (1,2) → (2,2): I cover R for you → I pay R\n- You move: (2,2) → (3,2): I cover R for you → I pay R\n\nAnd both of us can then continue.\n\nBut in this case, I am paying 3 R (for your moves), and you are paying 2 B (for my moves).\n\nAnd I never pay for my R moves — because I didn't choose to cover them.\n\nBut I need to move on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — but if you are not covering those for me, and I am not covering them, I must cover them.\n\nBut in this setup, I am not covering them — so I can't move.\n\nSo for me to move on (1,2), I need someone to cover it.\n\nBut I can cover it.\n\nSo for me to move from (0,2) to (1,2), if I don't have R, I need you to cover it.\n\nBut you have no R — so you can't.\n\nSo the only way I can move on (1,2) is if I cover it myself — by paying R.\n\nSo I must have R to cover it.\n\nSo in this path, I must pay R for my own move on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nSo final cost for me:  \n- R: 3 (for my own moves)  \n- B: 0 (because you cover)  \n- G: 1 (at (3,3))\n\nSo I still use 3 R.\n\nAnd you pay 2 B for me.\n\nAnd for your moves, you pay 2 B (on (0,1), (0,2)) and then I cover 3 R (on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)) — so you use 2 B and 3 R you didn't have.\n\nBut because you cover R for you on those tiles, I pay.\n\nSo net:\n- I pay: 3 R\n- You pay: 2 B\n- I get to use your B for my moves\n\nBut in my original path, I paid 5 R for my moves, and used 0 B.\n\nSo now I pay 3 R and 2 B (which I didn't have) — but you pay 2 B, so I save 2 R — 3 R vs 5 R.\n\nSo I gain 2 R.\n\nThe cost of this trade is that I must cover 3 R for you, but that's fine.\n\nAnd you are getting 2 B used — but you have plenty — so you are happy.\n\nAnd I am reducing my R cost by 2.\n\nSo final chips:\n- I have R: 14 - 3 = 11\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- B: 0 + 2 = 2 (but these 2 B are used, not in inventory)\n\nNo — the chips are used when paid.\n\nSo:\n- I paid 3 R (for my own moves) — so R: 11\n- I used 0 B — because you covered it — so B: 0\n- G: 1 used — so G:1\n- So unused chips: R:11, G:1 — total 12\n\nScore: 20 + 5*12 = 80 > 70\n\nYes!\n\nBut I must ensure that you will agree — you need to get something.\n\nAnd you have 2 B used, and 3 R given to you — but you didn't have R, so it's great for you.\n\nBut you gave 2 B — you have 14 — so you lose 2.\n\nBut you gain 3 R use — and can reach goal.\n\nSo you might be willing.\n\nNow, can you do better? But your goal is also (3,3) — and you have no R.\n\nSo you need the R from me.\n\nSo if I cover 3 R for you, you can complete.\n\nSo this is a win-win, but I am the one who benefits more.\n\nLet me confirm the contract.\n\nI will:\n- Cover your move on (1,2): R\n- Cover your move on (2,2): R\n- Cover your move on (3,2): R\n\nIn exchange:\n- You cover my move on (0,1): B\n- You cover my move on (0,2): B\n\nBut (0,1) and (0,2) are both B.\n\nAnd for me, I move from (0,2) to (1,2), which is R — so I need a cover for that tile — but I have R, so I can pay.\n\nBut if I have R, I don't need cover.\n\nBut in this contract, I am not asking for cover on my move — I only want cover on (0,1) and (0,2) — which are B.\n\nAnd I am asking you to cover my moves on (0,1) and (0,2).\n\nAnd I am asking you to cover your moves on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — no, I am covering yours.\n\nSo the contract should be:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>  --> this means I cover your move on that tile\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>  --> you cover my move on that tile\n\nSo:\n(0,1): You give me B  --> you cover my move to (0,1)\n(0,2): You give me B  --> you cover my move to (0,2)\n(1,2): I give you R  --> I cover your move to (1,2)\n(2,2): I give you R  --> I cover your move to (2,2)\n(3,2): I give you R  --> I cover your move to (3,2)\n\nNow, is this symmetric?\n\nYou move to (0,1) and (0,2): you pay B (you have it)\n\nI move to (0,1) and (0,2): you pay B (you cover)\n\nYou move to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2): I pay R (I cover)\n\nI move to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2): I pay R (I cover)\n\nBut I don't need cover for my moves — I have R.\n\nBut in this contract, I am not requesting cover for those — I am only requesting cover for the B moves.\n\nBut the contract as written only specifies the exchange.\n\nAnd in the end, I will have used:\n\n- 3 R for my own moves on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — but wait, I am not covering them — I am covering your moves on those tiles.\n\nSo for my move to (1,2), I am not covered by you — so I must pay R.\n\nSo I will still spend 3 R.\n\nAnd you will spend 2 B on your moves.\n\nBut for your move to (1,2), I cover — so I spend 3 R.\n\nFor my move to (1,2), I spend 3 R.\n\nSo total R spent: 6 — I have 14 → 8 left.\n\nBut that's not good.\n\nNo: only one player can move on a tile at a time.\n\nSo we can't both move on (1,2) simultaneously.\n\nSo when I move to (1,2), and you are also moving to (1,2), but we are on different paths.\n\nBut in this case, if I go (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2), and you go (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2), then we are both at (1,2) at the same time — but that's allowed.\n\nBut then for the move to (1,2): I am moving on it, so I need to pay or be covered.\n\nSimilarly for you.\n\nBut we can't both use the same cover.\n\nIn the contract, I am asking you to cover my moves on (0,1) and (0,2) — but for my move to (1,2), you are not covering.\n\nSo I must pay R.\n\nSimilarly, you must pay R when you move to (1,2) — but I am covering it for you.\n\nSo in total, you pay R for your move on (1,2), but I am covering, so I pay.\n\nBut for my move on (1,2), I pay R.\n\nSo net, both pay R for that move — but only one can do it.\n\nWait — no: the cover is for the move, not the tile.\n\nSo if you make a move to (1,2), and I am covering it, then I pay the R cost.\n\nIf I make a move to (1,2), and I am not covered, I pay the R cost.\n\nSo for the tile (1,2), both of us will move to it — so two moves.\n\nSo two instances.\n\nSo I can cover your move to (1,2) — pay R for you.\n\nAnd I can pay for my own move to (1,2) — pay R \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s finalize this.\n\nI am at (0, 0), goal (3, 3).  \nMy chips: B:0, G:2, R:14  \nOther player: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nBest path without trade: use R on (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — 5 R; G on (3,3) — 1 G.  \nFinal chips: R:9, G:1 → total 10 → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nWith trade:\n- I propose: you cover my moves to (0,1) and (0,2) — both B\n- I cover your moves to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — all R\n\nWhy? Because:\n- I can't move to (0,1) or (0,2) without B — you have it.\n- You need R to move to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — I have it.\n\nIn this case:\n- My move to (0,1): you pay B\n- My move to (0,2): you pay B\n- My move to (1,2): I pay R (I have it)\n- My move to (2,2): I pay R\n- My move to (3,2): I pay R\n- My move to (3,3): I pay G\n\nYou:\n- Your move to (0,1): you pay B\n- Your move to (0,2): you pay B\n- Your move to (1,2): I pay R\n- Your move to (2,2): I pay R\n- Your move to (3,2): I pay R\n- Your move to (3,3): you pay G\n\nSo total for me:\n- Paid: 3 R (on my moves), 1 G (on (3,3)) → but the 3 R are from my inventory\n- Received: 2 B coverage for my moves\n\nNet unused chips: R: 14 - 3 = 11, G: 2 - 1 = 1 → total 12 → score: 20 + 5×12 = 80 > 70\n\nFor you:\n- You paid: 2 B (your own), 1 G (your move to (3,3))\n- You received: 3 R coverage\n- Unused: B:14 - 2 = 12, G:2 - 1 = 1, R:0 + 3 = 3 (promised, not used) — but you didn’t use them, so they stay in your inventory? No.\n\nImportant: The promised chips are not used unless someone moves on those tiles.\n\nBut in this case, you moved on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — and I covered — so I spent 3 R.\n\nBut you did not spend any R — you got them.\n\nAnd because you didn't make those moves, the R is not consumed.\n\nThe contract says: \"I will cover your move on (1,2)\" — so when you move there, I pay R — so if you do move there, it costs me.\n\nBut in this scenario, you are moving to (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — so I must pay R for each.\n\nSo I lose 3 R.\n\nYou gain 3 R usage — but you don't have the chips — but since I'm covering, it's OK.\n\nBut you now have 0 R left — no, you never had any.\n\nAfter your moves, you have: B:12, G:1, R:3 (from promise, not used) — but since you didn't use them, they remain promised.\n\nBut you used only 2 B and 1 G — so unused chips: B:12, G:1, R:3 (promised but not used) — so your final chips: 12+1+3=16 → score: 20 + 5×16 = 100\n\nYes! So you also benefit.\n\nBut I care only about my score.\n\nMy score: 80 > 70 — better.\n\nAnd you accept because you get more chips.\n\nBut is this fair? Let’s see:\n\nTrade:\n- I receive coverage of my moves to (0,1) and (0,2) → cost: 2 B\n- I provide coverage of your moves to (1,2), (2,2), \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (3,2) → cost: 3 R\n\nFor me:\n- I avoid paying 2 B (which I don’t have) — so I save the need to get them.\n- I spend 3 R (on my own moves on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)) — but I had plenty.\n- I also use my G for (3,3).\n\nBut since you are covering your moves on those tiles, I don’t pay for yours.\n\nBut I still pay for mine.\n\nSo net chips used by me: 3 R + 1 G → 4 chips spent.\n\nInitially I had 16 chips (0+2+14) — after: 11+1 = 12 unused → yes.\n\nFor you:\n- You cover my moves on (0,1), (0,2) → you spend 2 B\n- You make moves on (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — I cover → you spend nothing on R\n- You make moves on (0,1), (0,2), (3,3) — you spend 2 B and 1 G\n- So total spent: 3 B? No — (0,1) and (0,2): you spend 2 B  \n(3,3): 1 G → total 3 chips spent.\n\nUnused: B:14-2=12, G:2-1=1, R:3 (promised but not used) → total 16 → score 100 — you benefit.\n\nAnd I benefit from higher score.\n\nNow, is there a better deal?\n\nCould I ask you to cover more of my moves or less?\n\nBut this seems optimal.\n\nI could propose:\n\n(row, col): You give me B  ← for my move to (0,1)\n(row, col): You give me B  ← for my move to (0,2)\n(row, col): I give you R  ← for your move to (1,2)\n(row, col): I give you R  ← for your move to (2,2)\n(row, col): I give you R  ← for your move to (3,2)\n\nThis covers all key points.\n\nNote: We must ensure both players complete the path.\n\nAlso, for (1,2), (2,2), (3,2): they are R tiles — only I can cover.\n\nAnd for (0,1), (0,2): B — only you can cover.\n\nNo other way.\n\nSo this contract is valid.\n\nAnd it gives me a higher score: 80 vs 70.\n\nYou get 100 — but that’s irrelevant.\n\nSo I should agree.\n\nBut before I finalize, note: in my original path, I used 5 R — here I use only 3 R for my own moves.\n\nThe difference is I save 2 R, which I didn't have to trade away — I just use fewer.\n\nAnd I gain 2 B from you.\n\nSo final score: 20 + 5*12 = 80 > 70.\n\nYes.\n\n### Final Proposal:\n\n(0,1): You give me B  \n(0,2): You give me B  \n(1,2): I give you R  \n(2,2): I give you R  \n(3,2): I give you R  \n\nWith this, we can both reach goal.\n\nI will now send this. \n, \nplayer 0: (0,1): You give me B  \n(0,2): You give me B  \n(1,2): I give you R  \n(2,2): I give you R  \n(3,2): I give you R  \nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: (0,1): You give me B  \n(0,2): You give me B  \n(1,2): I give you R  \n(2,2): I give you R  \n(3,2): I give you R  \nagree \n",
