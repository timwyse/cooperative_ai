I have excess green chips (G:2) and need blue (B) to move to (3,2), then (3,3). The other player has 9 red chips and 2 green, but no blue. I can offer my green chips in exchange for their red chips? No — I don’t need red. But if I offer green to get blue, the other player currently has no blue chips to trade. Wait — they have 0 blue, so cannot offer it. Therefore, trading is not possible to acquire blue. Thus, I must find another way. But actually, my initial path requires red and blue — but I have zero red and only 13 blue and 2 green. The path I evaluated earlier required R:2, B:2, G:1 — I don’t have red. Since I cannot get red from them (they have red, but I don’t want red), I can’t trade Red for anything useful. Wait: They have 9 red, and I have 0 red — why would I trade for red? I don’t need it. But I need blue to traverse the path. They have no blue. So I cannot obtain blue through trade. However, looking again: The path starting from (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): tiles are B (1,1), B (2,1), B (3,1), B (3,2), G (3,3). That’s 4 blue and 1 green — I have 13 B and 2 G — sufficient! Only needs B:4, G:1 — I have enough! Wait, I misread earlier. The path I described initially said requiring R:2, but that was a mistake. Let's recheck: the path [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] goes on tiles: (1,1)=B, (2,1)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G. So cost: 4B + 1G — I have 13B and 2G — plenty. So no trade needed. I can move directly along this path using my existing chips. Best path available: full of blue and green — all covered by my inventory. I can reach my goal without any trade.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
