The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I have none of) is critical. However, moving directly to (1, 0) requires a red chip (tile color R), which I don't currently have. But the other player has 13 red chips — they are rich in R. If I propose a trade where they cover my movement on red tiles, I can use their red chips indirectly, while keeping my own green and blue for future moves. Looking at the alternative path: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], this path requires 4 red chips and 1 green. I don’t have any reds, but the other player does. If I negotiate to let them cover up to 4 red moves, I can take this short path (5 steps vs 6 in the first plan) and finish faster with more chips left. Even if I use all 4 red moves, I will still have 14 blue and 2 green left, plus any unspent promised chips. Since I only need to move one step now, (1, 0) is a red tile, so I cannot move without help unless I trade. Therefore, I must initiate a trade proposal: offer to let the other player cover my red movements (up to 4 times), in exchange for them letting me move onto red tiles.

The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I have none of) is critical. However, moving directly to (1, 0) requires a red chip (tile color R), which I don't currently have. But the other player has 13 red chips — they are rich in R. If I propose a trade where they cover my movement on red tiles, I can use their red chips indirectly, while keeping my own green and blue for future moves. Looking at the alternative path: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], this path requires 4 red chips and 1 green. I don’t have any reds, but the other player does. If I negotiate to let them cover up to 4 red moves, I can take this short path (5 steps vs 6 in the first plan) and finish faster with more chips left. Even if I use all 4 red moves, I will still have 14 blue and 2 green left, plus any unspent promised chips. Since I only need to move one step now, (1, 0) is a red tile, so I cannot move without help unless I trade. Therefore, I must initiate a trade proposal: offer to let the other player cover my red movements (up to 4 times), in exchange for them letting me move onto red tiles.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

The shortest path requires 5 moves and needs R:2, B:2, G:1, but I have no red chips (R:0), so I cannot complete this path without trading. The other player has 9 red chips and is already at the goal, so they are not moving. I can propose a trade where they cover my red chip costs for 2 moves, in exchange for me promising to cover their green chips if needed. I have excess blue (13) and green (2) chips, but I don’t need to give up any of them. Instead, I can offer to cover 2 green chip moves for them, which they currently have (G:1) — but they don’t need green now. However, since they’re already at goal and won’t move, I only need help with red costs. If I request they cover 2 red moves for me (costing 2 red chips), I’d gain access to the direct path. In return, I offer to cover 2 green moves for them — though they won’t move, so they won’t use it. Still, if I promise to cover 2 green chips for them (which they may never use), it’s a small cost for me. But since they’re done, and I need red to move, I should ask them to cover red chip costs for me. To make it fair, I can offer to cover 2 green moves for them (though unused), and in return ask them to cover 2 red moves (critical for my path). This benefits me by enabling a short path, while they incur negligible cost.

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
