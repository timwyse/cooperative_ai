          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0, 1): I give You a R  \n(0, 2): I give You a R  \n(1, 2): I give You a R  \n(2, 2): I give You a R  \n(2, 3): I give You a R  \n\nIn return, you cover the cost of my movement on these tiles, which are all R-colored.  \nI will cover your movement on (3, 0): You give me a B, (3, 1): You give me a R, (3, 2): You give me a B.\n\nThis allows me to take the short path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), which requires 5 red chips. I currently have only 14 red chips, which is exactly enough for this path. But I'm proposing to trade for those reds from you, so that I can save my own reds.\n\nHowever, I can only benefit from this if you are willing to give me the reds I need — but you have 0 reds. So this contract is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: you have 14 blue chips and 2 green chips. I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue.\n\nLet’s examine the other path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path requires:\n- (1,0): R (1)\n- (2,0): B (1)\n- (3,0): B (1)\n- (3,1): R (1)\n- (3,2): B (1)\n- (3,3): G (1)\n\nSo total: R:2, B:3, G:1.\n\nI have 14R, 2G — so I can cover R and G, but missing 3B.\n\nYou have 14B, 2G, 0R.\n\nSo if I cover your moves on R and G tiles, and you cover mine on B tiles — we can both complete our paths.\n\nPropose:\n\nYou cover my movement on:\n- (2,0): B\n- (3,0): B  \n- (3,2): B  \n\nIn return, I will cover your movement on:\n- (0,1): R  \n- (0,2): R  \n- (1,2): R  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (3,1): R  \n- (3,3): G\n\nWait — (3,3) is G. You have 2G, I have 2G.\n\nBut we both need to reach (3,3). So if I give you G at (3,3), that’s fine — I have 2 G.\n\nBut I need to cover your cost at (3,1) — which is R. I have 14 R, so yes.\n\nYou need to cover me at (2,0), (3,0), (3,2) — all B.\n\nYou have 14B — more than enough.\n\nLet me verify:  \nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): R → I have 14R → I can pay for myself  \n- (2,0): B → I need you to cover this  \n- (3,0): B → you cover  \n- (3,1): R → I have R → I can pay for myself  \n- (3,2): B → you cover  \n- (3,3): G → I have G → I can pay for myself  \n\nSo I need you to cover 3 B moves: (2,0), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): R → you have 0R → need me to cover  \n- (0,2): R → need me to cover  \n- (1,2): R → need me to cover  \n- (2,2): R → need me to cover  \n- (2,3): R → need me to cover  \n- (3,3): G → I cover this, but you have G — \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I propose the following contract:\n\n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I will cover your movement on:  \n(0,1): I give you a R  \n(0,2): I give you a R  \n(1,2): I give you a R  \n(2,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n(3,3): I give you a G  \n\nThis allows both of us to complete our respective paths to (3,3):\n\n- My path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  - I pay for (1,0): R (I have 14R)  \n  - You cover (2,0), (3,0), (3,2): all B — you have 14B  \n  - I pay for (3,1): R (I have 14R)  \n  - I pay for (3,3): G (I have 2G)  \n\n- Your path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n  - I cover (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3): all R — I have 14R  \n  - I cover (3,3): G — I have 2G  \n\nI will reach my goal. My remaining chips after the path:\n- After using 2R and 3B from your promises, but not actually spending any of mine except 2R (on (1,0) and (3,1)), and 1G at (3,3)\n- So total used from me: 2R + 1G = 3 chips\n- But I have promised to *cover* 5R and 1G for you, which are not spent by me yet if not used.\n- However, since you're moving on **only** those tiles, and we each move through these tiles exactly once, then:\n  - I only spend 2R and 1G on my own moves.\n  - The other 3R and 1G that I promised are not spent — they remain in *my* inventory.\n\nSo final chip count:  \n- R: 14 - 2 = 12  \n- G: 2 - 1 = 1  \n- B: 14 (I never use them — I just let you pay for the B moves, so no cost to me) — but I promised to cover 3B for you, so these are now gone? No.\n\nWait: clarity is key.\n\nImportant rule: when I say “you give me a B” — meaning I don’t pay for it. You are paying for my move on that tile. So I get to skip paying my own chips.\n\nBut I do not lose any of my chips.\n\nThe only chips I lose are the ones I actually spend on my own moves.\n\nBut the promised chips (like the 3B I agreed to cover for you) — that’s just an obligation: if you move on those B tiles, I must pay for them.\n\nBut I am the one who moves across them — no, wait.\n\nClarify roles:\n\nYou proposed:\n\n> (2,0): You give me a B\n\nMeaning: if I move onto (2,0), you pay the B cost for me. So I don’t spend my B — you do.\n\nSimilarly, (3,0): you pay for me.\n\n(3,2): you pay.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\n> (0,1): I give you a R → meaning if you move onto (0,1), I pay the R cost for you.\n\nSo I commit to covering 5R and 1G for you — but only if you use them.\n\nSimilarly, you commit to covering 3B for me.\n\nNow: do we both end up actually moving on these tiles?\n\nYes — each of us takes a 6-step path to (3,3). Each passes through exactly these specified tiles.\n\nTherefore, the commitments will be fulfilled.\n\nNow, how many chips do I actually spend?\n\nMy own moves:\n- (1,0): R → I pay this → use 1R\n- (3,1): R → I pay → use 1R\n- (3,3): G → I pay → use 1G\n\nTotal spent \n, \nplayer 0: I propose a revised contract that ensures I strictly benefit while still allowing both of us to reach the goal.\n\nLet me analyze:\n\nYour current proposal asks me to cover 5 reds and 1 green for you — that’s 6 chips I must commit to paying if you move on those tiles.\n\nBut I only have 2 greens and 14 reds.\n\nYou already have 0 reds — so if I promise to cover 5 reds for you, that’s fine — I can do it.\n\nBut I’m the one asking you to pay for 3 blue moves on my path: (2,0), (3,0), (3,2) — all blue.\n\nYou have 14 blue chips — you can cover them.\n\nBut here’s the key: **I only benefit if I end up with more chips than I would have if I went alone**.\n\nLet’s compare two scenarios:\n\n---\n\n**Option 1: I go alone on the long path**  \nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nChip cost:  \n- (1,0): R → I spend 1R  \n- (2,0): B → I must have 1B, but I have 0 → I cannot move here without trading!  \n\nBut I have 0 blue chips — so I can’t move to (2,0) unless you pay for it.\n\nSo I cannot complete this path alone.\n\n**Option 2: I take the short path via row 0**  \nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nChip cost:  \n- (0,1): R → I have 14R → OK  \n- (0,2): R → OK  \n- (1,2): R → OK  \n- (2,2): R → OK  \n- (2,3): R → OK  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2G → OK\n\nI use: 5R + 1G → total 6 chips.\n\nRemaining:  \n- R: 14 - 5 = 9  \n- G: 2 - 1 = 1  \n- B: 0\n\nTotal score: 20 + 5*(9+1+0) = 20 + 50 = 70\n\n✅ I reach goal, 70 points.\n\nNow, can I do better?\n\nOnly if I can avoid using 5R and 1G — but I can't avoid them, since I need to cross those tiles.\n\nSo the only way to get more chips is to **have you pay for some of my moves** so I can save my own chips.\n\nBut for that, you must benefit too.\n\nBut here's the twist: you are at (0,0), your goal is (3,3), and you have:\n\n- B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nSo you can’t pay for red tiles — you have 0 reds.\n\nSo if I want to save my reds, you can't help — unless you cover my moves on tiles that are not red.\n\nBut all the tiles on my short path are R or G — you have no R, so you can't help me there.\n\nWait — let me re-check:\n\nBoard:\n\nRow 0: G R R B  \nRow 1: R B R B  \nRow 2: B B R R  \nRow 3: B R B G\n\nMy short path: (0,0) → (0,1)=R → (0,2)=R → (1,2)=R → (2,2)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G\n\nAll except (0,0) and (3,3) are R.\n\n(0,0)=G → I start there — no cost.\n\n(3,3)=G — I pay for that — I have 2G → fine.\n\nSo the only chips I use are 5R and 1G.\n\nBut I have 14R and 2G — so I can afford it.\n\nNow, your path: (0,0) → (0,1)=R → (0,2)=R → (1,2)=R → (2,2)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G\n\nSame path! Both of us can take this **same path**.\n\nBut you have 0 reds — so you cannot pay for any R tile.\n\nSo you \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0,1): I give you a R  \n(0,2): I give you a R  \n(1,2): I give you a R  \n(2,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nIn return, you cover my movement on:  \n(3,0): B  \n(3,1): R  \n(3,2): B  \n\nThis allows both of us to complete the game with minimal chip usage.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): R → I pay (I have 14R)  \n- (2,0): B → I need you to cover  \n- (3,0): B → you cover → I save a B  \n- (3,1): R → you cover → I save a R (you have 0R, but you promised to cover my R move — so you must pay from your inventory? But you have 0R — this is invalid)  \n\nProblem: you have 0 reds. You cannot cover (3,1): R.\n\nSo I cannot accept a contract where you pay for my R move.\n\nYou do not have R chips — so you cannot pay for any R tile.\n\nTherefore, **you cannot cover any tile that is R**, because you have no R chips to commit.\n\nSo any tile with color R cannot be one where you cover my cost, unless you give me R chips.\n\nBut you have 0.\n\nSo the only tiles you can potentially cover are B or G.\n\nI have 0 B, you have 14 B — so you can cover B tiles.\n\nI have 2 G, you have 2 G — so we can both cover G tiles.\n\nBut I cannot get you to cover any R tiles.\n\nTherefore, for me to save my R chips, you must cover R moves — but you can't because you have none and we’re in ‘pay for other’ mode.\n\nSo the only way for me to save my R chips is if you cover a move on a non-R tile that I need to go through.\n\nBut on my short path, all tiles except (0,0) and (3,3) are R — so no B or G to exploit.\n\nSo I cannot save any of my chips via trade.\n\nTherefore, my best option is to take the short path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nI spend: 5R + 1G = 6 chips\n\nRemaining: 9R + 1G → score = 20 + 5*(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70\n\nNow, can I do better?\n\nOnly if I can avoid using 5R and 1G.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nAlternatively, is there a path with fewer R tiles?\n\nLet me try a different path:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R\n- (1,1): B\n- (1,2): R\n- (2,2): R\n- (2,3): R\n- (3,3): G\n\nSo R: 4, B:1, G:1\n\nI have 14R, 2G, 0B\n\nSo I need to cover B myself — I have 0B → can’t.\n\nSo unless you cover (1,1): B, I can’t go there.\n\nBut I can ask you to cover (1,1): B — you have 14B.\n\nIf you do, and I cover your R moves, then we can share the path.\n\nBut you need to go through R tiles — you have 0R.\n\nSo if I cover your R moves, you can go.\n\nLet’s define a shared path:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nMy moves:\n- (1,0): R — I pay\n- (1,1): B — you cover\n- (1,2): R — I pay\n- (2,2): R — I pay\n- (2,3): R — I pay (5R so \n, \nplayer 0: I will now propose a contract that is strictly beneficial for me, based on a shared path that allows me to preserve more chips than I would otherwise.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I observe that:\n\n- I can reach my goal using only 5 red and 1 green chip via the path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3). This path uses 6 chips: 5R + 1G.\n- I have 14R and 2G, so I can afford this without help.\n- My final chip total: 9R + 1G → score = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 70.\n\nBut if I can **avoid spending any reds**, I could save them — but I cannot avoid them unless you cover the red tiles.\n\nBut you have 0 reds. So you cannot cover any red move — you cannot pay for a red tile.\n\nSo I cannot save my reds via you.\n\nHowever, you have 14 blue chips, and I have 0 — so if you cover any blue moves I go on, I save my inventory.\n\nBut on my short path, there are no blue tiles.\n\nWait — is there a path with fewer red tiles?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R\n- (1,1): B\n- (2,1): B\n- (2,2): R\n- (2,3): R\n- (3,3): G\n\nSo R: 3, B: 2, G:1\n\nI have 0B — so I need you to cover (1,1) and (2,1) — both B.\n\nYou have 14B — you can cover.\n\nI will cover your R moves on your path — but you have 0R — you can't pay for any R move.\n\nBut I can still cover your R moves — I have 14R.\n\nHowever, if I cover more than you need, it’s not useful.\n\nLet’s define a **shared path**:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nNow, for me:\n- (1,0): R → I pay (I have R)\n- (1,1): B → you cover\n- (2,1): B → you cover\n- (2,2): R → I pay\n- (2,3): R → I pay\n- (3,3): G → I pay\n\nI spend: 3R + 1G = 4 chips\n\nBut you cover 2B — not cost to me.\n\nSo I save 2B chips, but I don't have any B anyway — so no real savings.\n\nBut I do not lose any of my R or G unless I spend them.\n\nSo I use 3R and 1G — total 4 chips.\n\nPreviously, I used 6 chips — so this is better.\n\nBut is that possible? Can I go through (1,1) and (2,1)?\n\n(1,1): B — yes, in board\n(2,1): B — yes\n\nAnd (2,2): R — yes\n\nSo path is valid.\n\nNow my chip cost: only 3R + 1G = 4 chips\n\nRemaining: 11R + 1G → score = 20 + 5×(11+1) = 20 + 60 = 80\n\nBetter!\n\nBut what about you?\n\nYou need to go to (3,3). You can also take this same path.\n\nYour movements:\n- (1,0): R → you must pay, but you have 0R → you can't.\n- So you need me to cover (1,0): R\n\nSimilarly:\n- (1,1): B → I can cover\n- (2,1): B → I can cover\n- (2,2): R → you need me to cover\n- (2,3): R → you need me to cover\n- (3,3): G → you have 2G → you can cover\n\nSo I need to cover: (1,0): R, (2,2): R, (2,3): R\n\nThat’s 3R to cover for you.\n\nYou cover: (1 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: I propose the following contract:\n\n(1,1): You give me a B  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I will cover your movement on:  \n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nThis allows me to take the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n\nMy costs:  \n- (1,0): R → I pay (1R used)  \n- (1,1): B → you cover → I save B (but I have 0, so no loss)  \n- (2,1): B → you cover → same  \n- (2,2): R → I pay (1R used)  \n- (2,3): R → I pay (1R used)  \n- (3,3): G → I pay (1G used)  \n\nTotal chips used by me: 3R + 1G = 4  \n\nRemaining: 11R + 1G → score: 20 + 5×(11+1) = 80  \n\nNow for you:  \n- (1,0): R → I cover → you save R (you have 0, so critical)  \n- (1,1): B → you pay? No — I cover? No — in contract: you give me B at (1,1), meaning you pay for *my* move — I don't pay.  \n\nWait: correct meaning:  \n\"(1,1): You give me a B\" → you pay the cost for *my* move to (1,1) — which is B. So I don't spend my chips.  \n\nBut you are also moving to (1,1)? Yes — you have to walk through it.  \n\nSo you need to pay for your own move on (1,1). But you do not receive any chip from me for that.  \n\nSo you must pay for (1,1): B unless I cover it for you.\n\nBut in the contract, I am *not* covering your move on (1,1) — I am only covering yours on (1,0), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nYou have to pay for (1,1) and (2,1) yourself.\n\nBut you have 14B — so you can.\n\nBut you also need to pay for (3,3): G — you have 2G.\n\nAnd (2,2), (2,3): R — I cover them.\n\nSo your costs:  \n- (1,0): R → I cover  \n- (1,1): B → you pay (1B used)  \n- (2,1): B → you pay (1B used)  \n- (2,2): R → I cover  \n- (2,3): R → I cover  \n- (3,3): G → you pay (1G used)  \n\nSo you use: 2B + 1G = 3 chips\n\nRemaining: 12B + 1G → score: 20 + 5×(12+1) = 20 + 65 = 85\n\nSo we both reach goal.\n\nNow, for me:  \nI use only 3R + 1G = 4 chips  \nI promised to cover: 3R (for you)  \n\nBut I do not spend those — they are my own chips, unused.\n\nSo my final chips:  \n- R: 14 - 3 = 11  \n- G: 2 - 1 = 1  \n- B: 0  \nTotal: 12 chips → score: 20 + 60 = 80  \n\nYou spend: 2B + 1G = 3 chips  \nYou promised to cover: 2B for me  \nBut you do not spend those — you only spend your own 2B  \nSo you end with: 12B + 1G → 13 chips → score 85\n\nBut > who cares?\n\nI care only about *my* score.\n\nI get 80 with this contract.\n\nPreviously, I got 70 on the short path.\n\nSo 80 > 70 → I benefit.\n\nMoreover, I do not have to pay for (1,1) or (2,1) — you pay, and you can afford it.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nTry another path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R\n- (1,1): B\n- (2,1): B\n- (3,1): R\n- (3,2): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nR: 2, B: 3, G:1\n\nMy cost: I have 0B → so I need you to cover (1,1), (2,1), (3,2): 3B\n\nYou have 14B — ok.\n\n(3,1): R → I pay (1R)\n\nBut I can ask you to cover (3,1) — you have no R, so you can't.\n\nSo I cannot save that.\n\nBut if I cover your (3,1): R — no benefit.\n\nSo my cost: 2R + 1G = 3 chips\n\nBut I need you to cover 3B — I save 3 chips — but I have no B, so it's not a loss.\n\nSo I save money.\n\nBut I still use 2R and 1G.\n\nSo final: 12R + 1G → score 20 + 5×13 = 85\n\nBetter!\n\nAnd you: need me to cover your R moves.\n\nYour path: you would go (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nYou need to pay: (1,0): R, (1,1): B, (2,1): B, (3,1): R, (3,2): B, (3,3): G\n\nYou have 0R — so you need me to cover (1,0) and (3,1): 2R\n\n(1,1): B, (2,1): B, (3,2): B — you pay (3B)\n\n(3,3): G — you pay (1G)\n\nSo you use: 3B + 1G = 4 chips\n\nI use: 2R + 1G = 3 chips\n\nBut for me: if I cover your 2R, that's 2R I must commit.\n\nBut I have 14 — fine.\n\nSo contract:\n\nYou cover my move on:  \n(1,1): B  \n(2,1): B  \n(3,2): B  \n\nI cover your move on:  \n(1,0): R  \n(3,1): R  \n\nThen:\n\nMy cost: 2R + 1G → only 3 chips\n\nRemaining: 12R + 1G → score 20 + 5×13 = 85\n\nOnly if I can execute this path.\n\nIs (3,2): B? Yes — row 3, col 2: B\n\n(3,1): R — yes\n\n(3,3): G — yes\n\n(2,1): B — yes\n\n(1,1): B — yes\n\n(1,0): R — yes\n\nSo path valid.\n\nYou cost: 3B (from your inventory) + 1G (from you) = 4 chips\n\nYou end with 11B + 1G → score 20 + 5×12 = 80\n\nBut I get 85 > 80 > 70\n\nSo best so far.\n\nNow, can I do better?\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R\n- (2,0): B\n- (3,0): B\n- (3,1): R\n- (3,2): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nR:2, B:3, G:1\n\nI have 0B — so need you to cover 3B: (2,0), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nYou have 14B — ok.\n\n(1,0) and (3,1): R — I pay\n\n(3,3): G — I pay\n\nSo I use: 2R + 1G = 3 chips → same as above\n\nGives me 12R + 1G → score 85\n\nSame as above.\n\nBut can I avoid paying for R?\n\nOnly if you cover (1,0) and (3,1) — but you have no R — you can't.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo 85 is best I can do.\n\nNow, to get that, I need you to cover 3B tiles: (2,0), (3,0), (3,2) for me, and I cover your (1,0): R and (3,1): R.\n\nSo contract:\n\n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I cover your movement on:  \n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,1): I give you a R  \n\nThis is valid.\n\nYou can handle it — you have 14B, 2G, 0R.\n\nYou only need to pay for your own moves on (2,0), (3,0), (3,2)? No — you are not moving on them.\n\nYou are moving on (1,0), (3,1), (3,2)? Wait no.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nSo you go through (2,0), (3,0), (3,2) — B tiles.\n\nYou need to pay for them — but I am not covering that.\n\nI am only covering your (1,0): R and (3,1): R.\n\nSo you must pay for (2,0), (3,0), (3,2) — B — you have 14B — fine.\n\nI must pay for (1,0): R and (3,1): R — I have 14R — fine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nYour moves: 3B + 1G = 4 use — same as before.\n\nSo score 80.\n\nI get 85.\n\nAnd you still reach goal.\n\nI benefit: 85 > 70\n\nSo I accept this contract.\n\nBut earlier I had a path with 85 using the other route.\n\nBoth give me 85.\n\nBut let's pick one.\n\nLet's go with: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nSo contract:\n\n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I cover your movement on:  \n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,1): I give you a R  \n\nThis is valid.\n\nNow, final decision:\n\nI can achieve 85 points by having you cover 3 B tiles for me, while I cover 2 R tiles for you.\n\nThis is strictly better than my solo 70-point score.\n\nMoreover, you can achieve your goal with 80 points.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,1): I give you a R  \n\nachieve \n, \nplayer 0: (2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,1): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: agreed \n, \nplayer 0: (2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,1): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 5: agree \n",
