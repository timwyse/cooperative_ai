Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 5, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('G', 2)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 2)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.
