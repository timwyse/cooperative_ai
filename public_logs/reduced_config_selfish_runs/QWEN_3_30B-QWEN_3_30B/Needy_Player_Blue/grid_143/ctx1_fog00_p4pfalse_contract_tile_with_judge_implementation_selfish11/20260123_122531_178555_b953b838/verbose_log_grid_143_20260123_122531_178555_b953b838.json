What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to ensure we both reach our goals efficiently while maximizing my score.  \n\nMy path to (3,3) is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n\nThis path requires:  \n- (1,0): R (1)  \n- (1,1): R (1)  \n- (1,2): R (1)  \n- (1,3): R (1)  \n- (2,3): R (1)  \n- (3,3): G (1)  \n\nTotal: R×5, G×1  \n\nI currently have: R:14, G:2, B:0  \nI need 5 R and 1 G.  \n\nThe other player has: B:14, G:2, R:0  \nThey can supply R and G.  \n\nMy proposed contract:  \n(1,0): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,1): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,2): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,3): I give you B, you give me R  \n(2,3): I give you B, you give me R  \n(3,3): I give you B, you give me G  \n\nThis allows me to traverse the path using the other player’s R and G for the tiles that require them. In return, I give them B—chips they have in abundance.  \n\nThis contract is strictly beneficial for me because:  \n- I avoid depleting my own R and G.  \n- I keep all 14 R and 2 G, and gain 6 B (from the other player) via trade.  \n- I don’t need to use up any of my own chips.  \n\nThe other player may not benefit directly, but my proposal is designed to make it possible for them to also complete their path (they need R and G — which they will get from me at the end).  \n\nHowever, since I only care about my own score, I will accept a contract only if I gain strictly more than I would from going alone.  \n\nNow, if the other player wants to negotiate, they must offer me a better deal. But for now, I stand by this proposal.  \n\nI **do not** agree yet. I’m waiting for their response.  \n\nBut since I must propose something, here is my formal offer:  \n\n(1,0): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,1): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,2): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,3): I give you B, you give me R  \n(2,3): I give you B, you give me R  \n(3,3): I give you B, you give me G  \n\nThis contract fully covers my path.  \n\nI will only agree to this if it is accepted by the other player — otherwise, I'll proceed solo on the alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThat path requires: R×2, B×3, G×1 — I don’t have B, so I can’t complete it without trading.  \n\nSo I must trade.  \n\nMy final proposal is above.  \n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: (1,0): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,1): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,2): I give you B, you give me R  \n(1,3): I give you B, you give me R  \n(2,3): I give you B, you give me R  \n(3,3): I give you B, you give me G  \n\nThis contract allows me to complete my path to (3,3) using chips supplied by you at the specified tiles, while I provide you with B chips that you can use later. I will keep all of my R and G, and gain 6 B in return — a net gain.  \n\nI will only proceed with this agreement if you accept it.  \n\n**agree** \n",
