Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 3), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is directly down: (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). Let's analyze the tiles along this path:\\n\\n- (1,3): Red (R)\\n- (2,3): Red (R)\\n- (3,3): Green (G)\\n\\nMy current inventory: {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} – I have no red chips.\\n\\nHowever, I have a contract with the other player where they promised to cover up to 2 moves for red tiles. This contract is recorded as: \\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\\n\\nWait – the only red-covered tile in the contract is (1,0), which is not on my intended path. Importantly: **The contract terms apply only to the specific tiles and colors listed**. Since (1,3) and (2,3) are not in the contract, and the other player has not agreed to cover any red moves beyond what’s listed (and that was specifically for (1,0)), I cannot rely on them to cover R moves on (1,3) or (2,3).\\n\\nAdditionally, in previous turns, the other player repeatedly declined to cover R moves for me. They now have 10 R chips, but have not offered additional coverage beyond what’s already stated.\\n\\nTherefore, moving to (1,3) requires 1 red chip, which I do not have. I can’t pay it myself, and the other player has not committed to covering this move via trade (even though we had a prior offer that was declined).\\n\\nSo I cannot proceed down the direct path because I lack red chips and no active agreement covers those moves.\\n\\nAlternative idea: Is there a way to get red chips through a trade? The other player has 10 R chips and only 1 G and 0 B. I have 10 B and 2 G, but both players' needs differ.\\n\\nBut crucially: if I try to move onto a tile of color R, the other player must have promised it in the contract — and they did not. So I cannot move to (1,3) unless I get permission or new agreement.\\n\\nCould I propose a trade? Possibly, but I must ask: will it help me more than just waiting and staying put?\\n\\nBut here's the key: I currently have a promise *from* the other player to cover **2 red chips**, but only if I move onto a red tile they've pre-agreed to cover — but none of their covered tiles are on the path I want to take. That promise is essentially useless for reaching (3,3) right now.\\n\\nThus, **I cannot make any forward move** toward my goal without either obtaining red chips (which I can't do via trade immediately since no new agreement exists) or violating game rules by trying to move without payment.\\n\\nSince I cannot move forward safely, and attempting to move would risk failing to complete the goal (which results in losing everything), I should **not** attempt a move.\\n\\nInstead, I can consider proposing a new trade: e.g., offering to cover some of their green moves or something else in exchange for red coverage. But this is risky: if I don’t get coverage, my score drops to zero. However, I’m currently at (0,3) — and if I stay here, I keep all 12 chips (10B + 2G), and still have a chance to negotiate later.\\n\\nBut my better option is: is there a path using only blue and green tiles? Let's check:\\n\\nFrom (0,3): \\n- (0,2): Blue (B) → I have 10 B → OK\\n- (0,1): Blue → OK\\n- (0,0): Blue → OK\\n- Then down to (1,0): Red — stuck again\\nOr go from (0,0"
