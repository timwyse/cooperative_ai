What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let's analyze the situation.\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal is (3,3).  \nYou have:  \n- B: 0  \n- G: 2  \n- R: 14  \n\nOther player has:  \n- B: 14  \n- G: 2  \n- R: 0  \n\nBoard:  \nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R R R R  \nRow 2: B R B R  \nRow 3: B B R G  \n\nYour two best paths to goal:  \n1. Prioritize your chips:  \n   Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n   Chips required: R:5, G:1  \n   You have R:14 (ok), G:2 (ok) — so this path is viable without trade.  \n   But you will spend 5 R and 1 G → end with 9 R and 1 G → total score: 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70  \n\n2. Prioritize their chips:  \n   Path: (0,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n   This path:  \n   (0,0)=G → (1,0)=R → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=B → (3,2)=R → (3,3)=G  \n   So chips: R:1, B:3, G:1  \n   You have R:14 (plenty), but G:2 (ok), but B:0 → need 3 B chips.  \n   You can't afford B chips. So you must trade with other player to cover B moves.\n\nBut let's check: can you use the first path without trading? Yes — you have enough R and G.\n\nBut can you do better?\n\nWait — what if you go: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThis path:  \n(0,0)=G → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nSo: B:3, R:2, G:2  \n\nYou have no B chips — so you must get B from other player.\n\nOther player has B:14 — plenty.\n\nBut this path requires 3 B and 2 R and 2 G — you have R:14, G:2 — so only B is missing.\n\nSo to take this path, you need 3 B chips from the other player.\n\nBut your own path with (1,0) to (1,3) is R-heavy — 5 R and 1 G — you have that — so it’s doable.\n\nBut in the path (0,0) to (0,3) to (3,3), you only spend 2 G, 2 R, 3 B — so you’d end up with: G:0, R:12, B:0 → score: 20 + 5*(12+0) = 80 → better than 70.\n\nWait — but you don't have B chips. You need to get them via trade.\n\nBut you can only get them if you trade.\n\nSo can you do it?\n\nLet’s compare:\n\nPath A (via row 1):  \nTiles: (0,0)=G → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=R → (1,2)=R → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nChips used: G:1, R:5  \nYou have G:2 → spend 1 → have 1 left  \nYou have R:14 → spend 5 → have 9 left  \nEnd: score = 20 + 5*(1 + 9) = 20 + 50 = 70\n\nPath B (via row 0):  \n(0,0)=G → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nChips: B:3, \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: You are at (0, 0), goal is (3, 3).  \nYou have: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14  \nOther player has: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0  \n\nYou are considering two viable paths to goal:\n\n---\n\n### **Path A: Through Row 1 (horizontal move at row 1)**\n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Chips required:  \n  - (1,0): R → 1  \n  - (1,1): R → 1  \n  - (1,2): R → 1  \n  - (1,3): R → 1  \n  - (2,3): R → 1  \n  → Total R: 5  \n  - (0,0) = G (you pay) → 1 G  \n  - (3,3) = G (you pay) → 1 G  \n  → Total G: 2  \n  - B: 0 needed  \n- You have R:14 → enough  \n- You have G:2 → exactly enough  \n- After path: R: 9, G: 0, B: 0  \n- Score: 20 + 5×(9) = 20 + 45 = **65**? Wait — **no**: 5 × (R + G + B remaining) = 5×(9 + 0 + 0) = 45 → 20 + 45 = **65**\n\nWait — I made a mistake earlier.\n\nYou start with 14 R and 2 G — you **spend 5 R and 2 G**, so remaining: R:9, G:0, B:0  \n→ Final chips: 9 → score: 20 + 5×9 = 20 + 45 = **65**\n\nWait — **no**! You only use G at (0,0) and (3,3) — that's **2 G**, yes — so G:0 left.\n\nBut the scoring is: **5 points per remaining chip, regardless of color**.\n\nSo 9 chips left → 5×9 = 45 → 20 + 45 = **65**\n\n---\n\n### **Path B: Through Row 0 (top row)**\n- Path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Chips required:\n  - (0,1): B → need 1\n  - (0,2): B → need 1  \n  - (0,3): B → need 1  \n  → Total B: 3  \n  - (1,3): R → need 1  \n  - (2,3): R → need 1  \n  → Total R: 2  \n  - (0,0): G → 1  \n  - (3,3): G → 1  \n  → Total G: 2  \n- You have:\n  - B: 0 → so you need 3 B chips\n  - R: 14 → enough\n  - G: 2 → enough\n\nSo you can't take this path without **getting 3 B chips from the other player**.\n\nOther player has B:14 — plenty.\n\nSo if you trade for 3 B chips (to be paid by them when you step on B tiles), you can take this path.\n\nBut — **how does trade work?**\n\nYou must **negotiate a contract**: for each tile (row, col) where you need to pay B, you can get the other player to cover that cost.\n\nSo you must request:  \n- (0,1): B → they cover\n- (0,2): B → they cover\n- (0,3): B → they cover\n\nYou will use your own G and R, but they will pay for the 3 B moves.\n\nSo after path:  \n- You spend: 2 G (on (0,0), (3,3)), 2 R (on (1,3), (2,3)) → so G:0, R:12\n- You **do not spend** B — but you **used 3 B moves**, so the other player must have committed to cover those 3 B payments.\n\nNow — **if you successfully trade**, the other player must pay 3 B chips for \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s now consider the other player’s perspective.\n\nThey are at (0,0), goal (3,3).  \nThey have: B:14, G:2, R:0  \n\nTheir best path?\n\nThey cannot use any R tiles — they have 0 R chips.\n\nSo any path that requires R is a problem.\n\nPossible paths for them:\n\nOption 1: (0,0)=G → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → invalid — need R, but they have 0 R chips.\n\nSo they cannot go to (1,3) — no R.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0)=R → they can't go there — no R chips.\n\n(2,0)=B → ok  \n(2,1)=R → can't go  \n(2,2)=B → ok  \n(2,3)=R → can't go  \n(3,0)=B → ok  \n(3,1)=B → ok  \n(3,2)=R → can't go  \n(3,3)=G → ok\n\nSo their only possible R-free tiles:  \n- (0,0)=G  \n- (0,1)=B  \n- (0,2)=B  \n- (0,3)=B  \n- (2,0)=B  \n- (2,2)=B  \n- (3,0)=B  \n- (3,1)=B  \n- (3,3)=G  \n\nSo they can only reach (3,3) via B or G moves.\n\nCan they go:  \n(0,0)=G → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → blocked\n\nNo.\n\n(0,0)=G → (0,1)=B → (1,1)=R → blocked\n\nOnly non-R paths:  \nMust go down to row 3 via B.\n\nTry: (0,0)=G → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → blocked\n\nNo R, no way.\n\nTry: (0,0)=G → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=B → (3,3)=G?  \nBut (3,2)=R → can’t go through that.\n\nIs there a path without R?\n\nCheck all neighbors:\n\nFrom (0,0):  \n- (1,0)=R → blocked (no R)  \n- (0,1)=B → ok\n\nSo only (0,1)\n\nFrom (0,1):  \n- (0,0)=G → back  \n- (0,2)=B → ok  \n- (1,1)=R → blocked\n\nFrom (0,2):  \n- (0,1)=B  \n- (0,3)=B  \n- (1,2)=R → blocked\n\nFrom (0,3):  \n- (0,2)=B  \n- (1,3)=R → blocked\n\nDead end — no way to go down.\n\nNow try path via (2,0):\n\n(0,0)=G → (1,0)=R → blocked\n\nSo they **have no valid path to get to (3,3)** without using R.\n\nUnless they get R chips from you.\n\nSo their path is impossible if they can’t get R chips.\n\nBut they have R:0 — they need 1 R at least to move to (1,0), (1,1), etc.\n\nSo their **only way** to survive is to **trade with you for R chips**, or get R chips from you via trade.\n\nBut you have R:14 — plenty.\n\nSo you **must** help them if they want to reach goal.\n\nBut they don’t have to — they can try to go via B only.\n\nBut from above, **no path exists for them** from (0,0) to (3,3) without stepping on R tiles.\n\nTry this path:\n\n(0,0)=G → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → blocked\n\n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → blocked\n\nOnly way down is via column 0, but (1,0)=R — no R chips → cannot move.\n\nSo the **only possible tile they can leave (0,0) from is (0,1)**\n\nBut (0,1)=B — ok, but then stuck — no way down\n\n(0,2)=B — same\n\n(0,3)=B — same\n\nNo vertical move possible without \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: You are at (0, 0). Goal is (3, 3).  \nYou have: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14  \nOther player has: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0  \n\nYou now understand the critical issue: **The other player cannot reach the goal without using R tiles, but they have no R chips.**  \nTherefore, **they cannot reach their goal unless they receive R chips from you via trade.**\n\nBut your objective is to **maximize your own score** — you only cooperate if it **strictly benefits you**.\n\nNow, your own viable paths:\n\n---\n\n### **Option 1: Go via row 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n- Chips required:  \n  - (1,0): R  \n  - (1,1): R  \n  - (1,2): R  \n  - (1,3): R  \n  - (2,3): R → 5 R  \n  - (0,0): G (you pay)  \n  - (3,3): G (you pay) → 2 G  \n- You have: R:14 → enough, G:2 → enough  \n- After: R:9, G:0, B:0  \n- Score: 20 + 5×(9) = 20 + 45 = **65**\n\n---\n\n### **Option 2: Go via row 0: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n- Chips required:  \n  - (0,1): B  \n  - (0,2): B  \n  - (0,3): B → 3 B  \n  - (1,3): R  \n  - (2,3): R → 2 R  \n  - (0,0): G  \n  - (3,3): G → 2 G  \n- You have: R:14 → enough, G:2 → enough, B:0 → need 3 B  \n- You **must trade for 3 B chips** from the other player\n\nIf you trade for 3 B chips (i.e. they agree to pay for these 3 B moves), then you can use this path.\n\nAfter this path:  \n- You spend: 2 G, 2 R → G:0, R:12  \n- You **do not spend any B** — they covered it  \n- You end with: R:12, G:0, B:0 → **12 chips left**  \n- Score: 20 + 5×12 = 20 + 60 = **80** → **20 points better than Option 1**\n\nSo **this path is far better for you** — **only 3 B chips needed**, and you have access to those via trade.\n\nBut the **other player has B:14**, so they can easily cover 3 B moves.\n\nNow — **can you force them to accept this trade?**  \nThey cannot reach the goal without R.  \nThey have R:0 → **cannot move at all unless they trade for R**.\n\nBut they **can only get R from you**, since you have 14.\n\n### So: The other player **must trade with you to reach their goal**.\n\nThey need R chips to move — and only you can provide them.\n\nSo **you have the upper hand**.\n\nYou can now **demand that they cover 3 B for you**, in exchange for you covering their R moves needed.\n\nBut you must **only agree if you strictly benefit**.\n\nLet’s structure a deal:\n\nIf you propose to cover their **R moves**, in exchange for them covering your **B moves**, you both can reach the goal.\n\nBut you have a better idea: **you want to use the top-row path (B-heavy), so you need 3 B from them.**\n\nThey need R from you.\n\nThey must reach goal — they cannot do it without R.\n\nSo **you can only agree to a trade if you benefit**, but also, you must **not let them go to goal without you getting something**, but you only care about your score.\n\nSo here’s the plan:\n\n> You: \"I can help you reach your goal if you agree to cover 3 B chips for my moves on (0,1), (0,2), and (0,3). In return, I will cover your R moves needed \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I will cover your R moves on tiles that require R for your path.\n\nBut you must also specify **your necessary R moves** for your path.\n\nSince you have no R chips, you must get R from me.\n\nBut you need R to move on R tiles — which are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)\n\nBut to reach (3,3), you need to go through at least one R tile — e.g., (1,0) or (1,3) or (2,3)\n\nLet’s assume your minimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → no, (3,2)=R → need R  \n(3,3)=G → yes\n\nBut (3,2)=R → need 1 R\n\n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → need 1 R  \n(2,0)=B → ok  \n(3,0)=B → ok  \n(3,1)=B → ok  \n(3,2)=R → need 1 R  \n(3,3)=G\n\nSo you need only 2 R chips — on (1,0) and (3,2)\n\nCan you do it? Yes.\n\nSo your required moves:  \n- (1,0): R → need 1  \n- (3,2): R → need 1  \n\nSo only 2 R chips.\n\nYou can reach goal with exactly 2 R.\n\nSo if you trade, you need 2 R from me.\n\nYou have B:14, G:2 — can cover their B and G moves.\n\nBut they need R.\n\nSo for you to benefit, you must **not spend more than you gain**.\n\nLet’s compute your score if you accept the deal:\n\n- You use path via top row:  \n  (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n  R moves: (1,3), (2,3) → need 2 R — **you have them**  \n  B moves: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) → **they pay**  \n  G: (0,0), (3,3) → you pay  \n  So you spend: 2 G, 2 R → end with G:0, R:12, B:0 → 12 chips  \n  Score: 20 + 5×12 = 80  \n\nNow, the other player:  \nThey go: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): R → you cover  \n- (3,2): R → you cover  \n- (0,0): G → they cover  \n- (3,3): G → they cover  \n- (2,0): B → they cover  \n- (3,0): B → they cover  \n- (3,1): B → they cover  \n\nSo they spend:  \n- G:2 → spend both  \n- B:3 (on (2,0), (3,0), (3,1))  \n- R:2 (on (1,0), (3,2)) → but you pay both  \n\nSo they use: 2 G, 3 B, 2 R → but the 2 R are paid by you, so they don’t spend R.\n\nSo they end with:  \n- G:0, B:14 – 3 = 11, R:0  \nBut they never spent R — you paid for them  \nSo they have: 11 + 0 = 11 chips  \nScore: 20 + 5×11 = 75  \n\nBut you only care about **your score**.\n\nBut the contract:  \nYou will give: cover 2 R → so you lose 2 R  \nBut you save 3 B — not using them.\n\nBut you already have 14 R — so losing 2 is ok.\n\nYour score: 80 — better than 65.\n\nSo you **benefit from the deal** — \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n",
