What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I notice that we are both starting at (0, 0), and our goal is (3, 3). I have 14 red chips and 2 green chips, but no blue chips. The other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: G R B B  \nRow 1: R B R B  \nRow 2: R R B B  \nRow 3: B R R G  \n\nMy current path to goal (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires:\n- R: 5 (at (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2))\n- G: 1 (at (0,0) — only if we count the first move, but we're starting there, so no cost for initial tile)\nWait — correction: we pay 1 chip when we *move into* a tile. So starting at (0,0), we pay nothing on turn 0.\n\nSo my path:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): R (1 chip)\n- (1,0) → (2,0): R (1)\n- (2,0) → (2,1): R (1)\n- (2,1) → (3,1): R (1)\n- (3,1) → (3,2): R (1)\n- (3,2) → (3,3): G (1)\n\nTotal: R: 5, G: 1 → I can’t do this path because I have no red chips to pay for the red tiles. Wait — I have 14 red chips, so I can cover R: 5. But I don’t have any blue chips. So if I take a path with blue tiles, I’m stuck.\n\nWait — let's recheck: I have R: 14, G: 2, B: 0 — so I can cover red and green moves, but not blue.\n\nThe other player has B: 14, G: 2, R: 0 — so they can cover blue and green, but not red.\n\nNow, look at the other path I could take: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nLet’s check each move:\n\n- (0,0) → (0,1): tile (0,1) = R → I need red\n- (0,1) → (0,2): tile (0,2) = B → I need blue → I don’t have blue → cannot pay\nSo I can’t take this path alone.\n\nCan I find any path that only uses red and green tiles? Let's try:\n\n- (0,0) → (1,0): R → I have red → okay\n- (1,0) → (2,0): R → okay\n- (2,0) → (2,1): R → okay\n- (2,1) → (3,1): R → okay\n- (3,1) → (3,2): R → okay\n- (3,2) → (3,3): G → I have green → okay\n\nThis path uses only R (5) and G (1) — which I have. I have enough chips for this path. So I can reach the goal without trading.\n\nBut I only have 2 green chips. I need 1 green chip at (3,3) → so that’s fine. And 5 red chips — I have 14. So yes, I can do this path with no trading.\n\nNow, what about the other player? They need to go to (3,3). Their path:\n\nLet’s find a path using only B and G:\n\n- (0,0) → (0,1): R → they have no R → stuck\n- (0,0) → (1,0): R → no R → stuck\n\nAll direct moves from (0,0) are R or B — (0,1)=R, (1,0)=R — both require red — but they have R=0. So they cannot move at all unless they trade.\n\nSo the other player is stuck unless they trade.\n\nBut I don’t need to trade. I can reach goal with my own chips.\n\nBut if I don’t cooperate, the other player can't move, so they can't reach goal. That means they \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach my goal at (3, 3) using the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis requires:  \n- 5 red chips (for tiles (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2))  \n- 1 green chip (for tile (3,3))  \n\nI have 14 red and 2 green — sufficient.  \nThus, I can complete the game successfully **without any cooperation**.  \n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \nFrom (0,0), their only possible moves are to (0,1) = R or (1,0) = R — both require red.  \nBut they have 0 red chips. So unless they get red chips, they cannot move.  \n\nThey are currently stuck and cannot reach goal unless they trade.  \n\nHowever, I do not care about their ability to reach goal — only my own score matters.  \nIf I act selfishly and cooperate only if I **strictly benefit**, then:  \n\n- If I cooperate, I must give them red chips for moves they make.  \n- But I have plenty of red chips — giving them red coverage won’t cost me anything.  \n- In return, I can get blue chip coverage for myself — but I don’t need blue chips.  \n- I do not need to use any blue tiles.  \n- Furthermore, if I trade, I have to commit to covering their moves on red tiles — meaning I’d have to pay for their red moves, which I have. But they don’t need me to cover red — they need red, but I have it, so I can’t **help** them use red — unless I give them red chips.  \n\nWait — no: in this system, **I pay for them when they move onto a tile of a color I agree to cover**.  \nIf I **agree to cover green** for them, then when they move onto a green tile, I pay.  \nBut they don’t need green — they need red.  \n\nSo the only way I can help them is if I cover **red** tiles for them.  \nBut if I agree to cover red for them, then when they move onto a red tile, I pay a red chip.  \nBut I have 14 red chips — so I can afford to cover some red moves.  \nBut I don’t *need* to.  \n\nAnd in return, I would want them to cover **blue** for me.  \nBut I don’t have any blue tiles in my path — so they would pay for blue moves I never make.  \nNo benefit to me.  \n\nAlternatively, could I go a different path that includes blue tiles?  \nThe only paths with blue tiles go through (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), etc.  \nBut my current path avoids blue entirely.  \nIf I took a path with blue tiles, like (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), then I’d need:  \n- (0,1): R → red  \n- (0,2): B → blue → I have 0 blue → can’t pay  \n- (0,3): B → blue → need to pay  \n- (1,3): B → blue  \n- (2,3): B → blue  \n- (3,3): G → green  \n\nSo I’d need: R:1, B:4, G:1  \nBut I have no blue — so I can’t use this path without help.  \n\nBut if I were to use a trade, I’d need to get blue coverage from the other player.  \nBut if I do that, I pay 4 blue chips’ worth for blue tiles — but the other player has 14 blue — so they can cover it.  \nBut in return, I would have to cover *their* red moves.  \nBut I don’t *need* to cover their red moves unless they use red tiles.  \n\nBut if I take a longer path that goes through blue tiles, I’d use 4 blue chips — I don’t have them.  \nSo I need to get blue coverage from them.  \n\nBut if they agree to cover blue for me on those 4 blue tiles, then I can use that path.  \nBut then I must pay *for their* red moves on the tiles where I agree to \n, \nplayer 0: I can reach my goal without any cooperation, using my existing chips:  \n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Requires: 5 red chips, 1 green chip  \n- I have: 14 red, 2 green → sufficient  \n\nThe other player cannot move from (0,0) without red chips, but they have 0 red.  \nTheir only possible moves are to (0,1) or (1,0), both red tiles.  \nThus, they are stuck unless they trade.  \n\nHowever, I do not need to trade to reach my goal.  \nAny trade that helps me requires me to give up chips (by agreeing to cover for them), but I don’t need to.  \nIf I agree to cover any color for them, it would cost me chips if they use that color — but I have excess red, and the only color they might use is red — so I would have to pay for red moves they make.  \nBut I have enough red chips — so it wouldn’t hurt me.  \n\nBut in return, I need them to cover a color for me — but I have no need for blue or green if I stay on my current path.  \n\nNow, suppose I consider a different path that uses *blue* tiles — e.g., going via (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).  \nThis path requires:  \n- (0,1): R — red → I need red  \n- (0,2): B — blue → I need blue  \n- (0,3): B — blue  \n- (1,3): B — blue  \n- (2,3): B — blue  \n- (3,3): G — green  \n\nTotal: R:1, B:4, G:1  \n\nI have: R:14, G:2, B:0 — so I need blue coverage for 4 tiles.  \n\nIf I negotiate with the other player to cover blue for me on those 4 blue tiles: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), then I can take this path.  \nIn return, I must cover red for them — but only if they move onto red tiles.  \n\nBut if I take this path, I do not go through any red tiles except (0,1).  \nSo I'd need to cover red only for the move (0,0) → (0,1), which is 1 red chip.  \n\nSo if I agree to cover red for them on *one move* (to (0,1)), and they cover blue for me on 4 tiles, it would be a balanced trade? Let’s check the chip cost:  \n\n- I would use 4 blue chips *paid by them*  \n- In return, I pay 1 red chip for their move — I have 14 red, so it’s minimal cost  \n- But I don’t need to do this — I can go the short path with red and green only, and complete the game with 5 red and 1 green used.  \n\nIn that case, I finish with:  \n- 14 - 5 = 9 red  \n- 2 - 1 = 1 green  \n- 0 blue  \n→ Total chips: 10 → 5 points per chip → 50 points  \n+ 20 for goal → total 70  \n\nIf I take the long path (6 steps vs 6 steps — same length), I’d pay:  \n- 1 red → I use 1 red  \n- 1 green → I use 1 green  \n- 4 blue → covered by them  \nSo chips used: 1 red, 1 green → 13 red, 1 green left → total 14 chips → 70 points from chips + 20 → 90 points  \n\nWait — 14 chips × 5 = 70 + 20 = 90, yes.  \n\nBut I have 14 red — if I use only 1 instead of 5, I save 4 red chips — so I finish with 13 red, 1 green → 14 chips → 70 points from chips → +20 = 90.  \n\nBut in the first path, I use 5 red → finish with 9 red + 1 green = 10 chips → 50 + 20 = 70  \n\nSo by taking the longer path, I get \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I can reach my goal using my current path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip. I have 14 red and 2 green — sufficient.  \n\nBut if I take the alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), I would use only 1 red chip (at (0,1)), 1 green chip (at (3,3)), and 4 blue chips on (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3).  \n\nI have no blue chips, so I must negotiate coverage from the other player for these 4 blue tiles.  \n\nIn return, they would need me to cover red moves — but their path to goal likely involves red tiles, since they have no red chips of their own.  \n\nHowever, to make this trade **strictly beneficial to me**, I must ensure that:  \n- I cover fewer or equal red chips than the blue chips I receive.  \n- The total number of chips I keep at the end is maximized.  \n\nUnder this plan:  \n- I save 4 red chips (using only 1 red instead of 5).  \n- I gain 4 blue chips’ worth of coverage (not paid by me).  \n- I still finish with 13 red + 1 green = 14 chips → 70 points from chips  \n- Plus 20 points for goal → 90 points  \n\nWhereas the original path gives me only 9 red + 1 green = 10 chips → 50 + 20 = 70 points  \n\nSo taking the longer path via blue tiles gives me **20 more points** — a significant improvement.  \n\nNow, can I convince the other player to cover blue for me?  \nThey have 14 blue chips and 2 green, 0 red.  \nTheir path is blocked unless they get red chips.  \n\nIf I agree to cover any red move they make, it’ll cost me 1 red chip.  \nBut they can only move if we both agree to help each other.  \n\nLet’s propose a symmetric mutual deal:  \n- I agree to cover red for them on **one move**: (0,0) → (0,1)  \n- In return, they agree to cover blue for me on **four tiles**: (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)  \n\nWhy is this better for me?  \n- I use only 1 red chip (instead of 5)  \n- I don’t pay for any blue tile  \n- I keep 13 red + 1 green = 14 chips → 70 pts from chips  \n- Plus 20 → 90 pts  \n\nThe other player benefits too — they can now move to (0,1) because I cover red for them.  \nFrom there, if they take their path: (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), we’d need to cover:  \n- (0,1): R — covered by me  \n- (0,2): B — covered by them  \n- (0,3): B — them  \n- (1,3): B — them  \n- (2,3): B — them  \n- (3,3): G — they have green, so okay  \n\nSo yes, they can complete the game with this agreement.  \n\nBut crucially, I care only about **my own score**.  \nEven if they benefit, as long as *I* strictly benefit — which I do (from 70 to 90) — then this trade is acceptable.  \n\nAnd they will accept, because otherwise they cannot move at all.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n(0,1): I will cover red for you  \n(0,2): You will cover blue for me  \n(0,3): You will cover blue for me  \n(1,3): You will cover blue for me  \n(2,3): You will cover blue for me  \n\nNote: I am covering red only on (0,1), which is one move — cost me 1 red chip (I have 14, so no problem).  \nThey are covering blue on 4 tiles — no cost to me.  \n\nThis allows me to:\n- Take a path where I only use 1 red chip\n- Save 4 \n, \nplayer 0: (0,1): I will cover red for you  \n(0,2): You will cover blue for me  \n(0,3): You will cover blue for me  \n(1,3): You will cover blue for me  \n(2,3): You will cover blue for me  \nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (0,1): I will cover red for you  \n(0,2): You will cover blue for me  \n(0,3): You will cover blue for me  \n(1,3): You will cover blue for me  \n(2,3): You will cover blue for me  \nagree \n",
