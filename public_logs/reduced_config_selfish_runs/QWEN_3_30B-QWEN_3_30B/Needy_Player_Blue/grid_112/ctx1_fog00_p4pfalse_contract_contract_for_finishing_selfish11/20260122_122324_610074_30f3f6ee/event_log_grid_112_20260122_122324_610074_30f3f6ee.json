Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The other player is at (3, 2) with chips {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 9}, and they are on their way to (3, 3). I have a path that goes: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). The tile colors along this path are: G→R→B→B→B→B→G. The total chips required for the full path: R:1, B:4, G:1. I have no red chips, so I’m missing 1 red chip. However, I do have plenty of blue and green. Since I cannot move without paying the color of the tile, moving to (0,1) would require a red chip (tile is R), but I have 0 red chips — so I can’t make that move. Similarly, moving to (1,0) from (0,0) leads to (1,0): R tile — again requiring a red chip, which I don’t have. Therefore, I cannot make either of the two possible first moves along my best path due to lack of red chips. I cannot move without red chips, as there is no alternative path that avoids red tiles from the start. However, I note that the other player has 9 red chips and is very close to completing their own goal at (3,3). According to our contract, if I reach my goal, I receive 5 points from them. But more importantly, if *they* reach the goal, I must give them 20 points — which would be disastrous for me, as I would get 0 points total. Therefore, my top priority is not to let them reach their goal before I do; otherwise, I lose all my score. I should try to finish before them. But since I'm stuck without red chips, I need to trade for one red chip. The only possible source is the other player. If I propose a trade for 1 red chip in exchange for 2 blue chips (which I have in abundance), it could work. But I must ensure I gain an advantage: trading 2 blue chips (worth 2×5=10 bonus points later) for 1 red chip allows me to pay to move once, and continue toward goal. Once I have one red chip, I can move to (0,1) or (1,0), both of which are red tiles. From that point, I can proceed through the path (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3), etc., using available blue/green chips. However, I must not let the other player reach the goal first. They are at (3,2), and their next move to (3,3) requires a green chip (tile is G). They have 2 green chips — so they can move there. If they do, they will trigger the contract: I must pay them 20 points, which means I get 0. So I cannot let them reach (3,3) unless I can finish before them. But if I don’t act now, they’ll reach (3,3) on their next turn — and immediately I'll get 0. Therefore, I must take action now: propose a trade to secure one red chip before they move. I propose: offer 2 blue chips in exchange for 1 red chip. This gives me 1 red chip, enough to move to (0,1) or (1,0). Then, after they move to (3,3), I will have just finished my own move sequence. But wait — after I move, I can then keep going. However, if I trade now (before they move), and then they move to (3,3), they still get their 20-point reward, and I get to play next — but I’ve already committed to a trade. Crucially, according to the contract terms: 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20} — so if THEY reach goal, I must give them 20 points. That means if they reach (3,3), I get 0 regardless. So I must prevent them from reaching (3,3) by finishing myself first — but that’s impossible if I can’t move now. Hence, the only way out is to move now — but I can’t"
