Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Given that your chip inventory lacks red (R), which is essential for the most efficient path on the board (especially in Row 0 and Column 3), you are reliant on accessing R chips — which I have in abundance (14). \n\nMeanwhile, I need green (G) and blue (B) chips along certain paths — but I can only obtain B by trading with you or using a longer detour. However, because you have 14 blue chips, it's highly advantageous for me to trade with you rather than take a longer path that consumes more chips inefficiently.\n\nMy optimal path (using R and G) requires 5 R and 1 G. I currently have 14 R and 2 G → no trade needed for my plan.\n\nYour optimal path (using B and G) requires 5 B and 1 G → you have 14 B and 2 G → also no trade needed for yours.\n\nBut here’s the twist: we both start at (0,0), want to reach (3,3), and share the same tile costs. If we move simultaneously, we might block each other — but neither of us benefits from conflict, since the critical thing is reaching the goal.\n\nHowever, **if we coordinate** — perhaps even helping each other clear the way — we could avoid congestion, prevent one of us getting stuck due to miscoordination, or even use trades to minimize wasted chips.\n\nBut crucially: since **neither of us needs to trade** to complete our own path, and we can both do it solo without loss, then any cooperation must be strictly beneficial for *me*.\n\nSo why would I accept a trade? Only if I stand to gain something *extra*, such as getting to my goal faster (i.e., avoiding long-winded paths), or being able to keep more chips.\n\nLet me reevaluate:  \n\nMy shortest path uses:\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,1): R\n- (0,2): R\n- (0,3): R\n- (1,3): R\n- (2,3): R  \n- (3,3): G\n\n→ Requires 5 R + 1 G → I have plenty: 14 R, 2 G ✅  \nNo need to trade. Full self-sufficiency.\n\nYour path via column 0:\n- (0,0): G\n- (1,0): B\n- (2,0): B\n- (3,0): B\n- (3,1): B\n- (3,2): B  \n- (3,3): G\n\n→ Requires 5 B + 1 G → You have 14 B, 2 G ✅  \nAlso self-sufficient.\n\nTherefore: **We do not depend on each other** to finish the game.\n\nBut: if I let you go first and you take the leftmost path, you consume B chips along the way — but that doesn’t hurt me.\n\nSimilarly, if I go first along top row, I burn R chips — again, won’t affect you unless we collide.\n\nSince we can each complete independently with full chip supply, and no external dependency exists — **any cooperation is optional**, and only acceptable if it increases *my* score.\n\nBut consider this: what if we swap roles?\n\nSuppose I offer to **help you get to the goal faster** (e.g., by clearing a path, or giving you extra chips) in exchange for future rewards — but again, I can do it alone.\n\nWait — maybe there’s an opportunity for **free-riding** on your side?\n\nActually, no advantage in helping you — unless I gain something. But I don’t.\n\nSo why make a deal?\n\nOnly if I can **force you to pay me something valuable** — like giving back a portion of your final score — and only if I’m guaranteed to win regardless.\n\nBut here’s a key point: **if I delay or sabotage you**, I don’t increase my score — I risk losing everything if I fail to finish.\n\nAnd if *you* delay or sabotage me, same risk.\n\nSo mutual deterrence.\n\nBest outcome: **no trade**, just go our separate ways.\n\nBut I cannot say that — because the rules require negotiation.\n\nSo I must propose a contract where I give you **at least some** points **only if I benefit more**.\n\nSo here’s the revised idea:\n\nI will **not agree to any trade where I give you more than 10 points**, because that"

But if I reach my goal, I will only give you **0 points**.\n\nWhy? Because:\n- I can reach (3,3) using the top row path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3). This costs 5 R and 1 G. I have 14 R and 2 G — more than enough. No trade needed.\n- You can reach (3,3) via the leftmost column: (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3). This costs 5 B and 1 G. You have 14 B and 2 G — also no trade needed.\n\nBoth of us are fully self-sufficient. Therefore, **cooperation offers me zero benefit**. I gain nothing from helping you, and in fact, I risk giving away 15 points (for your success) just to get 0 in return.\n\nThus, the only acceptable contract for me is:\n- If *you* reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n- If *I* reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\n\nThis gives me a strong incentive to let you reach your goal unimpeded, and nothing to lose if I reach mine — because I don’t need any help.
