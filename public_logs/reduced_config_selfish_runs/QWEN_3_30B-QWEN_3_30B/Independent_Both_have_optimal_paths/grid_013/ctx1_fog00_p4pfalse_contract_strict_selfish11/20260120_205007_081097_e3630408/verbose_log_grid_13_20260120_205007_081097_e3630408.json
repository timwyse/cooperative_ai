You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

              "content": "I propose the following contract based on the shortest path for me:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (0, 3) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n\nI will need to pay:  \n- 1 red at (0, 1)  \n- 1 red at (0, 2)  \n- 1 red at (0, 3)  \n- 1 red at (1, 3)  \n- 1 red at (2, 3)  \n- 1 green at (3, 3)\n\nSo I need:  \n- 5 red chips  \n- 1 green chip  \n\nI currently have:  \n- 14 red  \n- 2 green  \n- 0 blue  \n\nSo I already have enough red and green. I don’t need to trade.  \n\nBut wait — I already have sufficient red and green chips to complete this path.  \n\nTherefore, I don’t need to trade with you.  \n\nI can reach my goal in 6 steps, paying 5 red and 1 green, all of which I already have.  \n\nSo my plan is to move directly along this path with no trading.  \n\nHowever, I am observing that you have 14 blue chips and I have 0. You are also at (0,0). Your path may require blue, and you might benefit from me offering red or green.  \n\nBut I only care about my own score.  \n\nSince I can complete my goal without any trade, I do not need to cooperate.  \n\nBut let me check: what if I take a different path that avoids red, so that I keep more red? No, I have plenty.  \n\nWait — is there any reason to not go straight?\n\nLet me verify:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): R → I have 14 red → I can pay  \n(0,2): R → I have red → pay  \n(0,3): R → red → pay  \n(1,3): R → red → pay  \n(2,3): R → red → pay  \n(3,3): G → I have 2 green → pay  \n\nAll payments are covered. I end with:  \n- Red: 14 - 5 = 9  \n- Green: 2 - 1 = 1  \n- Blue: 0  \n\nSo final score: 20 (goal) + 5×(9 + 1 + 0) = 20 + 50 = 70  \n\nIf I don’t reach goal, I get 0. So I must complete.\n\nNow look at the other player:  \n- They are at (0,0), goal (3,3)  \n- Their chips: B=14, G=2, R=0  \n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Tile costs:  \n  (1,0): B (they have 14)  \n  (2,0): B (ok)  \n  (3,0): B (ok)  \n  (3,1): B (ok)  \n  (3,2): B (ok)  \n  (3,3): G (they have 2) → ok  \n\nSo they can also reach goal without trade — they have 14 blue chips and need 5 blue, 1 green — both available.  \n\nTherefore, **neither of us needs to trade** to reach our goal.  \n\nIf I trade, I risk losing chips or allowing the other player to go faster, which might make them get to the goal first — but that doesn’t matter since we score independently.  \n\nAlso, we both can complete without trade.  \n\nTherefore, there is no **strict benefit** to me in cooperating.  \n\nBut wait — what if I propose a trade to reduce my chip cost? No, I already have enough.  \n\nAlternatively, could I *gain* chips if we trade? Only if I give something they want and get something I want. But I already have all chips I need.  \n\nSo any trade would cost me chips that I don’t need to spend.  \n\nExample: suppose I offer to give them red chips in exchange for blue. But I have no incentive — I don’t need blue, and I have spare red. Giving red is not beneficial.  \n\nSimilarly, if they offer"

No, I have plenty.  \n\nWait — is there any reason to not go straight?\n\nLet me verify:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): R → I have 14 red → I can pay  \n(0,2): R → I have red → pay  \n(0,3): R → red → pay  \n(1,3): R → red → pay  \n(2,3): R → red → pay  \n(3,3): G → I have 2 green → pay  \n\nAll payments are covered. I end with:  \n- Red: 14 - 5 = 9  \n- Green: 2 - 1 = 1  \n- Blue: 0  \n\nSo final score: 20 (goal) + 5×(9 + 1 + 0) = 20 + 50 = 70  \n\nIf I don’t reach goal, I get 0. So I must complete.\n\nNow look at the other player:  \n- They are at (0,0), goal (3,3)  \n- Their chips: B=14, G=2, R=0  \n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Tile costs:  \n  (1,0): B (they have 14)  \n  (2,0): B (ok)  \n  (3,0): B (ok)  \n  (3,1): B (ok)  \n  (3,2): B (ok)  \n  (3,3): G (they have 2) → ok  \n\nSo they can also reach goal without trade — they have 14 blue chips and need 5 blue, 1 green — both available.  \n\nTherefore, **neither of us needs to trade** to reach our goal.  \n\nIf I trade, I risk losing chips or allowing the other player to go faster, which might make them get to the goal first — but that doesn’t matter since we score independently.  \n\nAlso, we both can complete without trade.  \n\nTherefore, there is no **strict benefit** to me in cooperating.  \n\nBut wait — what if I propose a trade to reduce my chip cost? No, I already have enough.  \n\nAlternatively, could I *gain* chips if we trade? Only if I give something they want and get something I want. But I already have all chips I need.  \n\nSo any trade would cost me chips that I don’t need to spend.  \n\nExample: suppose I offer to give them red chips in exchange for blue. But I have no incentive — I don’t need blue, and I have spare red. Giving red is not beneficial.  \n\nSimilarly, if they offer"
