Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 14 red and 2 green chips, so I can complete this path without needing any trade.\n\nMeanwhile, you are at (0,0) and your goal is (3,3). Your chips are: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red. The shortest path for you would require blue and red chips. But you have no red chips. The path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires 5 blue chips and 1 green chip — which you have. So you can also reach your goal without needing any trade.\n\nSince both of us can reach our goals without trading, cooperation is not necessary.\n\nHowever, suppose we both agree to help each other: if I help you get red chips, and you help me get blue chips, we might both be able to take shorter or more efficient routes. But I already have all the chips I need to complete my path.\n\nYour path to goal requires red chips, which I have. But you don’t need green chips — you only need blue and red. You have blue (14), so that’s fine. But you need 5 red chips to take your direct path? Wait: let’s check your tile path:\n\nYour current path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTile colors:  \n- (0,0): G → green  \n- (0,1): B → blue  \n- (0,2): B → blue  \n- (0,3): B → blue  \n- (1,3): B → blue  \n- (2,3): B → blue  \n- (3,3): G → green  \n\nSo the required chips: 5 blue, 2 green. You have 14 blue, 2 green. So yes — you can go that path without trading! You also have enough chips.\n\nSo: both of us can reach our goal without trading.\n\nTherefore, I don’t need you. I can complete my path and get 20 + (14 - 5) red + (2 - 1) green = 20 + 9 + 1 = **30 points**.\n\nYou can do the same: 20 + (14 - 5) blue + (2 - 2) green = 20 + 9 + 0 = **29 points**.\n\nSo I’m already better off not cooperating.\n\nBut wait — what if we both cooperate and trade, so that you use a path that avoids green chips? But you don’t need to — your path uses green chips, but you have them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I could help you go a red-path? But you have no red chips, and we have no red chips on the path you're considering.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: maybe you are on a path that requires red, but you don't have any. So if I give you red chips, you can take a different path?\n\nBut you don’t need to — you can reach goal using only blue and green, which you have.\n\nSo no need for trade.\n\nTherefore, my final position: I can reach my goal with 30 points. If I cooperate, I might be forced to give you points, which reduces my score. You’ll get points anyway. So it’s not worth it.\n\nBut suppose you want to help me? Then you’d need to give me some chips, but you don’t have green or red. Green I don’t need. Red? I have plenty. So you can’t help me. You can only help me if you have chips I need — but I already have all I need.\n\nSo I have no incentive to trade.\n\nThus, best outcome is to go alone.\n\nSo I propose:  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nThis way, no risk, no cost, I get my full 30 points.\n\nBut wait — what if you are missing a chip? Let me double-check.\n\nYou have blue: 14, green: 2. Your path: requires 5 blue and 2 green? Let’s recalculate:\n\nPath: (0,0): G → need 1 green  \n(0,1"
