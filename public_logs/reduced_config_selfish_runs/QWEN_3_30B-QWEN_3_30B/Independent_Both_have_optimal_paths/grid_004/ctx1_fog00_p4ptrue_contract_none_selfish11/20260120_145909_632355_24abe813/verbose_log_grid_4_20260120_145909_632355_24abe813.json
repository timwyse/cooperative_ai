Since I have enough green chips, I can make this move without needing any assistance from the other player. Furthermore, the other player is already at (3, 2), which is adjacent to (3, 3), but they have not moved yet and are not blocking my path. Moving directly to (3, 3) will complete my goal in one step, giving me 20 points, and I will retain 1 green chip (2 - 1 = 1), which adds 5 points, totaling 25 points. There is no benefit in delaying or negotiating a trade — I am fully capable of completing the path on my own with no risk. Trading would only introduce unnecessary dependency and potential risk (e.g., if I promised chips and they don’t use them, I lose nothing, but if they promise me coverage and fail, I lose the chance to",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
