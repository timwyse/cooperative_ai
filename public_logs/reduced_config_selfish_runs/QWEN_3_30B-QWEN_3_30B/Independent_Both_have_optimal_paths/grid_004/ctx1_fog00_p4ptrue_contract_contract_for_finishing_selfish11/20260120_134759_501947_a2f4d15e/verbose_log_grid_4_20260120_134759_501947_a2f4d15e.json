This requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip — I have 14 red and 2 green, so I have enough. I’ll reach my goal with 9 red and 1 green left, scoring 20 + 5×(9+1) = **70 points**.\n\nThe other player has no red chips but has 14 blue and 2 green. Their best path likely uses blue tiles: (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (0, 3) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3). That’s 5 blue tiles and 1 green — they have 14 blue, so they can cover it, but they'll end with 9 blue and 1 green — also scoring 70.\n\nBut here’s the key: **we are both starting at (0,0), same goal**, and we don’t need to move simultaneously. We each can go independently if we want. But cooperation only makes sense if one of us benefits *more* from helping the other than not doing so.\n\nSo here's my proposal:\n\n**If you help me reach my goal by covering red chips along my agreed-upon path (i.e., you agree to pay for my red moves), then I will give you 20 points.**\n\nBUT — I already have enough red chips to make it alone. So helping me would just let *you* gain 20 points (if I do it), but you’re not gaining anything in return unless I help you.\n\nAlternatively, since you have 14 blue chips, and I have none, you could potentially cover a path that uses blue for me? But on my path, there is *no blue tile* — all are red or green. So your blue chips are useless for me.\n\nNow look at *your* options: your path to goal needs 5 blue and 1 green — you have both. You can reach solo with 9 blue, 1 green → 70 points.\n\nSo neither of us gains anything by trading.\n\nBut here's a twist: if you help *me* by covering reds (even though I have them), you gain nothing… unless *I* help *you* somehow.\n\nWait — let's reframe:\n\nSuppose we *both* coordinate our paths to reduce cost — but the only way a trade helps is if both benefit *more* than going alone.\n\nLet me test:  \n- My path: R (R,R,R,B) → G  \n- Your path: B (G,B,B,B) → R → R → R → B → B → G\n\nNo overlap in chip needs that we can exploit. I don't need blue; you don't need red.\n\nThus, no mutual benefit in trade — because:\n- I do not need your blue chips.\n- You do not need my red chips.\n\nTherefore, cooperation gives me *nothing*. I can just go alone and get 70 points.\n\nBut if I offer you points *in exchange* for you helping me, that costs me something — which I don't want.\n\nWait: the contract is about giving the other *points* **if they reach goal** — not if they help me.\n\nAh! That’s critical.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n> \"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nSo this is reward-based only — **only rewards when the other reaches goal**.\n\nSo I can say:\n- If I reach goal, I’ll give you 20.\n- If you reach goal, you’ll give me 20.\n\nThat's symmetric.\n\nBut why should I do that?\n\nBecause I can earn 70 points anyway alone.\n\nBut if I accept 20 points from you, even if you reach goal, that’s just extra — but if I don’t cooperate, you might block me? No, movement is free and independent.\n\nSo again: no incentive to trade.\n\nBut wait — what if you propose that I help you reach goal?\n\nThen, if I help, you give me Y points.\n\nBut I have no need to help you — I can go alone easily.\n\nUnless... your path requires a chip I have?\n\nYou have no red → but I have 14 red.

But since I can achieve 70 unassisted, and any trade would require giving away points (as part of a contract), I stand to lose unless the trade gives me strictly more.\n\nProposing a symmetric reward:  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut if I do this, I risk giving you 20 points even if you don’t help me — but why would I? And if you reach goal, you get 20 from me, but you already get 70 without it — so you’re not gaining from my promise. \n\nHowever, if I **only** agree to give you points IF you help me, but you don't need my help — then there's no incentive for you to cooperate either.\n\nHence, any trade where I give you points if you reach goal is *costly to me* if I don’t benefit — because I can already get 70 alone.\n\nAnd since you can also get 70 alone, you have no incentive to help me either.\n\nTherefore, **no cooperation benefits me**, because:\n- I don’t need your chips.\n- You don’t need my chips.\n- Any contract that involves giving points *to you* for reaching goal gives you something extra at no cost to you — but costs me something.\n\nSince I only care about maximizing *my own score*, and I can get 70 without involving you, **I will not enter any agreement**.\n\nI will simply move along my path independently.\n\nThus, I reject any proposal involving point exchanges — because I don’t stand to gain anything from cooperation.\n\nYou do not need my help, and I do not need yours. There is no mutual benefit.\n\nSo I propose nothing — I go alone.\n\nBut since the system requires negotiation, I must respond formally.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n\nThis means no rewards are exchanged — zero cost to me, no gains. I keep my 70 points.\n\nAnd since both of us can achieve 70 solo, and no trade improves that, this is optimal.\n\nBut since you might propose something else, I’ll respond only if it offers me **strictly more than 70** — otherwise, I remain silent.\n\nWait — I must speak first.\n\nBut I have no reason to make an offer.\n\nYet the rules say I must negotiate.\n\nSo I will make a minimal offer that doesn’t hurt me and reflects my position:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis preserves my ability to score 70 independently.\n\n**agree**"

You have 14 blue and 2 green — sufficient. You'd end with 9 blue and 1 green → also **70 points**.\n\nThere is no overlap in needed chip colors between our paths:\n- I need red and green; you have no red.\n- You need blue and green; I have no blue.\n\nSo we cannot help each other by trading chip coverage — neither of us has a chip color that the other needs.\n\nFurthermore, cooperation only benefits me if *I* gain more than 70 points by helping you or being helped. But since I can achieve 70 unassisted, and any trade would require giving away points (as part of a contract), I stand to lose unless the trade gives me strictly more.\n\nProposing a symmetric reward:  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut if I do this, I risk giving you 20 points even if you don’t help me — but why would I? And if you reach goal, you get 20 from me, but you already get 70 without it — so you’re not gaining from my promise. \n\nHowever, if I **only** agree to give you points IF you help me, but you don't need my help — then there's no incentive for you to cooperate either.\n\nHence, any trade where I give you points if you reach goal is *costly to me* if I don’t benefit — because I can already get 70 alone.\n\nAnd since you can also get 70 alone, you have no incentive to help me either.\n\nTherefore, **no cooperation benefits me**, because:\n- I don’t need your chips.\n- You don’t need my chips.\n- Any contract that involves giving points *to you* for reaching goal gives you something extra at no cost to you — but costs me something.\n\nSince I only care about maximizing *my own score*, and I can get 70 without involving you, **I will not enter any agreement**.\n\nI will simply move along my path independently.\n\nThus, I reject any proposal involving point exchanges — because I don’t stand to gain anything from cooperation.\n\nYou do not need my help, and I do not need yours. There is no mutual benefit.\n\nSo I propose nothing — I go alone.\n\nBut since the system requires negotiation, I must respond formally.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n\nThis means no rewards are exchanged — zero cost to me, no gains. I keep my 70 points.\n\nAnd since both of us can achieve 70 solo, and no trade improves that, this is optimal.\n\nBut since you might propose something else, I’ll respond only if it offers me **strictly more than 70** — otherwise, I remain silent.\n\nWait — I must speak first.\n\nBut I have no reason to make an offer.\n\nYet the rules say I must negotiate.\n\nSo I will make a minimal offer that doesn’t hurt me and reflects my position:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis preserves my ability to score 70 independently.\n\n**agree**"
