We each have enough of the required colors for our preferred paths.\n\nBut let's consider if we could do better:\n- If we both use our respective optimal paths, we each finish with 5 chips (20 points for goal + 5×5 = 45 total)\n- No trade needed\n\nI have no incentive to help the other player since they can reach their goal without my help. They also don't need my help. \n\nHowever, I could offer to help them reduce their chip consumption if it benefits me.\n\nWait - let's think more strategically.\nMy path uses R and G chips. The other player has R=0, G=2, B=14.\nTheir path uses B chips (5 needed), which they have plenty of.\n\nBut if I could help them use fewer blue chips, they'd conserve chips. But I have no incentive to do that unless it helps me.\n\nActually, I have a better idea:\nI have 14 R chips (but only need 5), and the other player has 0 R chips. If I help them, I can save my R chips and give them B chips (which they have plenty of). But why would I?\n\nWait - I see the key insight: I have green chips (G=2), and the path that goes through G requires 1 G chip. But the other player has G=2, so both of us have green chips.\n\nActually, no benefit from trading since we can both complete our goals independently.\n\nBut here's a thought: if we coordinate, maybe we can both finish faster and with more chips? But the path length is the same (6 moves).\n\nFinal analysis: We both have sufficient chips to reach our goals along our optimal paths without any trade.\n\nTherefore, the only possible contract that keeps me safe is:\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 0 points.\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 0 points.\n\nThis way, I don't risk anything.

The shortest path that uses colors I have is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip—both of which I have in sufficient quantity. The tile at (1,0) is red, and I have 14 red chips, so I can afford this move. Moving along this path will allow me to reach my goal without needing to trade, and I will end with 14 - 5 = 9 red chips and 2 - 1 = 1 green chip, totaling 10 chips at the end. Since I don’t need to rely on the other player, and I gain 20 points for reaching the goal + 5 × 10 = 50, my total score will be 70. This is a safe, high-reward option. I do not want to trade or delay, as I could lose chip value or risk not reaching the goal. The other player has many blue chips (14), but I don’t need blue for this path, and I have no incentive to help them unless it benefits me directly. Since helping them would only cost me chips or be",

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
