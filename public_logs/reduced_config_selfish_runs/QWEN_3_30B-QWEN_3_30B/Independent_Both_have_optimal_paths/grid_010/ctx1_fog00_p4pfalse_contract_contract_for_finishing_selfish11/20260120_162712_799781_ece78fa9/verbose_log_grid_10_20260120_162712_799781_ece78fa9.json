Only cost: 6 moves = 5R + 1G used → I end with 9R + 1G → Final score: 20 (goal) + 5 (chips) = **25**.\n\nNow consider your path:  \nYou need to go from (0,0) → (1,0): B (1B) → (2,0): B (1B) → (2,1): B (1B) → (3,1): B (1B) → (3,2): B (1B) → (3,3): G (1G)  \nNeed: 5B + 1G → You have 14B + 2G → can also complete without trading → final score: 20 + 5 (remaining chips: 9B + 1G) = **25**\n\nSo both of us can reach the goal independently, without trade, and score 25 each.\n\nBut wait — in this scenario, if we don’t cooperate, we both get 25. So why would I agree to give you 10 points? That means I’d only net 15 instead of 25 — a massive loss.\n\nSo the only reason to trade is if *I* gain more by cooperating *and* helping *you* to avoid risk — but since I can easily do it alone with no risk, and you can too, there is no mutual benefit.\n\nTherefore, **I do not want to trade any points**, because I can complete the game optimally on my own.\n\nBut let's double-check: is there a situation where I lose if I go alone?\n\nNo — I have all the chips needed for my own path. I don’t need any blue or green from you — I already have enough red and green.\n\nSimilarly, you don’t need any red — you have enough blue and green.\n\nWe both are fully self-sufficient.\n\nThus, I do not benefit from cooperation — in fact, I lose by giving away 10 points when I could keep 25.\n\nSo my real offer should be:  \n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.**  \n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.**\n\nBut we can't just say that — the system requires a contract. So I’ll propose a contract where I give nothing, and you give nothing — which is neutral.\n\nBut if you propose anything else, I’ll reject it unless it offers me **strictly more** than 25 points.\n\nCurrently, maximum I can score is 25. Any contract that gives me less than that is bad.\n\nSo here is my actual proposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nThat’s fair — zero cost, zero benefit. But no risk either.\n\nWait — actually, if I help you, you might take longer, which risks your success — but again, you don’t need help.\n\nBut what if *I* suggest to you: \"I'll help you move toward your goal via a shared path, but I want to be compensated.\" But I don’t *need* to help — and you don’t need help.\n\nUnless... is there a shorter path that uses fewer total chips? No — both paths are 6 steps.\n\nBut here’s the key: **if I could somehow reduce my chip usage by trading, but only if you have chips I"
