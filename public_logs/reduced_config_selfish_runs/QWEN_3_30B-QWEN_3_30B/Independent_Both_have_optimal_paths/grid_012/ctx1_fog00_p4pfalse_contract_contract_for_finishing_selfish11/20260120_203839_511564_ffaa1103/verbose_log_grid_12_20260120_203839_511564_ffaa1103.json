This path requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip — all of which I currently have (R:14, G:2). I don’t need any blue chips.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. Their best path to (3,3) likely involves blue and green tiles — for example: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which requires 5 blue chips and 1 green — they have enough blue chips (14) and green (2), so they can also reach their goal on their own without trading.\n\nBut here’s the thing: neither of us needs the other to succeed. Both of us can reach our goal independently using only our own chips.\n\nThat said, if I help the other player go through a different path (e.g., one that uses fewer blues), we could potentially save them chips. But since we’re both selfish and only care about our own score, I don’t want to give away points unless I benefit.\n\nHowever, I do notice that if I take the red-green path (as I can), I’ll end with 14 - 5 = 9 red chips and 2 - 1 = 1 green, totaling 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nIf the other player takes the blue-green path, they’ll use 5 blue and 1 green → 14 - 5 = 9 blue, 2 - 1 = 1 green → 10 chips remaining → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nSo if both of us go alone, we both get 70 points.\n\nBut suppose we *cooperate*: if I help them avoid spending their limited blue chips, maybe they would be willing to trade or share some value? Let’s consider an alternative: what if instead of going solo, I **only** accept a contract where we each help each other reach goal and agree to transfer points?\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nWe both go independently, both get 70 points.\n\nBut wait — is there *any* reason to trade?\n\nNo!

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
