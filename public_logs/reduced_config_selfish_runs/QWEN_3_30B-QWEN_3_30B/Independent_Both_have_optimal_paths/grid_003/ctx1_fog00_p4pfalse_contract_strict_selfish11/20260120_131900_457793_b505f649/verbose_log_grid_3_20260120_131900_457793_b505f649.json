Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, I notice you (the other player) have a lot of blue chips (14) but no red chips. You are also starting at (0,0), same as me, and your goal is (3,3). \n\nLet me assess the shortest path for you:  \n- Your path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- This path requires: B (0,1), B (1,1), B (1,2), B (2,2), B (2,3) → 5 blue chips  \n- You have 14 blue chips, so you can afford this path with no trade needed.\n\nMeanwhile, I can go along the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Chip cost: R (1,0), R (2,0), G (2,1), R (3,1), R (3,2), R (3,3)?

I don’t need to trade.\n\nHowever, consider an alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: B (0,1), B (1,1), B (1,2), B (2,2), B (2,3), G (3,3)  \nThat’s 5 blue, 1 green.\n\nI don’t have any blue chips. I have 0 blue. You have 14 blue. So if I take this path, I need 5 blue.\n\nBut I have no blue chips. So I would need to trade with you.\n\nBut I don’t need to — I have a path that uses red and green, and I have more than enough of both.\n\nSimilarly, you have a clear path using 5 blue chips — you can do it with your own chips.\n\nSo both of us can reach our goals without trading.\n\nTherefore, I gain nothing from cooperating.\n\nBut — what if I use the blue path and trade with you for blue chips at a rate that gives me a better net chip count?\n\nLet’s calculate:\n\nMy current best path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Uses: 5 red, 1 green  \n- I spend 5 red, 1 green → I have 9 red, 1 green left → 10 chips → score = 20 + 5*10 = 70\n\nAlternative path using blue: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- Uses: 5 blue, 1 green  \n- I have 0 blue → I"

The green chip at (3,3) is required either way.\n\nBut if I trade with you for 5 blue chips, I must give you something in return. What can I give?\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green. You have 14 red and 2 green. Wait — you have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. So we’re symmetric in red and green.\n\nBut I can’t give you red — because you already have plenty. Same for green.\n\nBut I could trade red for blue? That might be bad — I need red for my own path.\n\nWait — let’s recheck my path:\n\nMy best path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,0): G (start, no cost)  \n(1,0): R → cost 1 R  \n(2,0): R → 1 R  \n(2,1): R → 1 R  \n(3,1): R → 1 R  \n(3,2): R → 1 R  \n(3,3): G → 1 G  \n\nSo total: 5 R, 1 G → I have 14 R, 2 G → after move, I have 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips left → score = 20 + 5*10 = 70\n\nNow, if I take the blue path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): B → 1 B  \n(1,1): B → 1 B  \n(1,2): B → 1 B  \n(2,2): B → 1 B  \n(2,3): B → 1 B  \n(3,3): G → 1 G  \n\nSo 5 B, 1 G → I have 0 B → I need to acquire 5 B → from you.\n\nYou have 14 B.\n\nSo I can trade: I give you X chips, you give me 5 B.\n\nBut I have 14 R, 2 G — all I have.\n\nYou have 14 R, 2 G, 0 B.\n\nSo the only chips I can offer are R or G.\n\nBut you have 14 R — you don’t need more R. You might even be willing to trade R for B, but only if you get a good deal.\n\nBut for *me*, I need to get 5 B — so I must give at least some R or G.\n\nSuppose I offer to give you 5 red chips for 5 blue chips.\n\nThen I lose 5 red, gain 5 blue.\n\nNow I have: 9 R, 2 G, 5 B.\n\nThen I take the blue path: spend 5 B and 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 50 = 70 — same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut what if I trade more red? Say, 6 red for 5 blue?\n\nThen I go from 14 R → 8 R, 5 B\n\nThen take path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 8 R, 1 G → 9 chips → score = 20 + 45 = 65 → worse.\n\nWhat if I trade only 5 red → same result as before.\n\nBut I have 2 green. Could I trade green?\n\nIf I trade 2 green and 3 red for 5 blue?\n\nThen after trade: 11 R, 0 G, 5 B\n\nThen take path: must pay 5 B, 1 G — but I have 0 G → stuck.\n\nSo I can't do that.\n\nTo take the blue path, I *must* have 1 green — because (3,3) is green.\n\nSo I need to keep 1 green.\n\nSo I have to keep at least 1 green.\n\nI start with 2 green → I can safely spend 1 green.\n\nSo any trade must not make me lose both greens.\n\nSo maximum I can give is 1 green, and up to 14 red.\n\nBut best trade: give 5 red for 5 blue → end up with same chip count (9 R, 1 G) → same score.\n\nNo gain.\n\nTherefore, **no benefit in trading**.\n\nBut — is there a *better* path?\n\nWhat if I go part of the blue path, then switch?\n\nNo — only two paths are length 6.\n\nAny other path would be longer, meaning I pay more taxes (more chips spent), so worse.\n\nTherefore, the best outcome for me is without trade: 70 points.\n\nSimilarly, for you — you can go the blue path with your own blue chips: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → 5 B, 1 G → you have 14 B, 2 G → after: 9 B, 1 G → score = 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nAlternatively, you could go the red path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → 5 R, 1 G → you have 14 R, 2 G → after: 9 R, 1 G → score = 70.\n\nSo you can also do 70 on your own.\n\nSo **no reason to trade**.\n\nNow, the only way I could gain more than 70 is if I could end with more than 10 chips — but with no trade, I end with 10.\n\nIf I could somehow get more than 10 chips, score would be higher.\n\nBut every move costs a chip.\n\nSo to get a higher chip count, I’d need to gain chips before spending them — but I can only do that through trade.\n\nBut if I trade to get chips, I have to give something.\n\nSuppose I trade 1 red for 1 blue — then I have 13 red, 1 blue, 2 green.\n\nThen I go on the blue path — pay 5 blue, 1 green → I have 13 red, 0 blue, 1 green → 14 chips → score = 20 + 70 = 90?\n\nWait! That’s way better.\n\nBut I only traded 1 red for 1 blue — I get 1 blue, but when I go on the blue path, I spend 5 blue.\n\nSo I need 5 blue to traverse that path.\n\nSo if I only trade 1 blue, I still need 4 more.\n\nBut I can’t get them unless I trade more.\n\nSo unless I trade for 5 blue, I can’t take the path.\n\nSo I need to get 5 blue.\n\nSo I must trade for 5 blue.\n\nSo I give you 5 chips (any color) to get 5 blue.\n\nWhat is the best deal?\n\nSuppose I trade 5 red → get 5 blue → I end with 9 R, 1 G → score 70.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut if I trade 1 red for 1 blue, and then go see if I can get more blue from elsewhere? But no — no one else.\n\nOnly you.\n\nSo I’d have to trade 5 times.\n\nBut each trade must be separate.\n\nBut if I trade 1 red for 1 blue, now I have 13 R, 1 B, 2 G.\n\nCan I go on any path?\n\nTo go on the blue path, I still need 4 more blue.\n\nI don’t have them.\n\nSo I can’t take the blue path until I get 5 blue.\n\nSo I have to trade 5 blue in total.\n\nSo I must offer 5 chips now.\n\nBut I can’t get multiple blue without multiple trades.\n\nBut if I do 5 separate trades, I can offer: 1 red per blue.\n\nSo total: 5 red → 5 blue.\n\nThen I can take the blue path.\n\nBut then I’ve spent 5 red → 9 red, 1 green → same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nCould I trade something that I have more of?\n\nNo — I have only R and G.\n\nYou have only R and G — same.\n\nWait — this is symmetric.\n\nBut I have no blue — you have no red.\n\nSo you can’t give me red — you have red.\n\nBut you might be willing to trade red for blue to help *you* — but you don’t need to.\n\nYou can take the blue path using your own blue chips.\n\nSo no incentive for you to trade with me.\n\nBut if you trade blue, you lose blue.\n\nAnd to reach your goal, you need 5 blue if you take the blue path.\n\nYou have 14 blue — so you can easily afford it.\n\nBut if you trade 5 blue to me, you only have 9 blue — still enough to reach goal via blue path.\n\nSo you could do that.\n\nBut why would you?\n\nYou have 14 red — you could go the red path without trading — same score 70.\n\nSo you have no incentive to trade unless you gain more than 70.\n\nSame for me.\n\nBut if I give you 5 red, and you give me 5 blue, then:\n\n- I take blue path: spend 5 blue, 1 green → end with 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → 70\n- You take the red path: spend 5 red, 1 green → end with 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → 70\n\nWe are both neutral.\n\nBut I could try to get more than 10 chips.\n\nFor example, if I can get 5 blue *without spending 5 chips*, I’d gain.\n\nBut I can’t — trading exchanges chips.\n\nSo the only way to gain chips is if the trade somehow gives me more chips than I give.\n\nBut no such trade is possible unless I give less than 5 chips for 5 blue.\n\nBut that would mean you're giving me 1 blue for less than 1 chip — which is losing money for you.\n\nSo you won’t do that.\n\nSimilarly, I wouldn’t do it unless I got at least as many chips.\n\nBut even if I trade 4 red for 5 blue, I give 4 chips, get 5 → net gain of 1 chip.\n\nBut then I can use that to pay for the blue path: spend 5 blue, 1 green.\n\nBut I spent 5 blue — but I only had 5 — so I need it.\n\nBut I start with 0 blue — so I must get 5 blue.\n\nIf I trade 4 red for 5 blue, I have: 10 r, 2 g, 5 b\n\nThen I go on blue path: spend 5 b, 1 g → end with 10 r, 1 g → 11 chips → score = 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nBetter than 70!\n\nBut I gave 4 red, got 5 blue — net +1 chip.\n\nBut cost: I have to pay 5 blue — but I get 5 blue from you.\n\nSo I can do it.\n\nBut you would only agree if you gain something.\n\nWait — you give me 5 blue for 4 red.\n\nYou lose 5 blue, gain 4 red.\n\nYou have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue.\n\nAfter trade: 18 red, 2 green, 5 blue — no, wait:\n\nYou start with: 14 R, 2 G, 0 B\n\nYou trade 5 B to me for 4 R → so you lose 5 B, gain 4 R.\n\nBut you had 0 B — so you can’t trade 5 B.\n\nYou don’t have blue chips to give.\n\nWait — you have 14 blue chips — yes, you do.\n\nYou have 14 B.\n\nSo you can give 5 B.\n\nSo if you give 5 B to me, you have 9 B left.\n\nAnd you gain 4 R — so you have 18 R, 2 G, 9 B.\n\nNow, can you reach your goal?\n\nYou need to take a path.\n\nIf you take the blue path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → costs 5 B, 1 G.\n\nYou have 9 B, 2 G → after: 4 B, 1 G → score = 20 + 5*5 = 45 → 20 + 25 = 45? 5*5=25 → 20+25=45.\n\nWait, 5 chips left? 4 B + 1 G = 5 → 5*5 = 25 → score 45.\n\nBut you could have taken the blue path without trading — spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 9 B, 1 G → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nBut after trade, you only have 9 B, 2 G.\n\nBut after taking blue path, you spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 4 B, 1 G → 5 chips → score 45.\n\nBut if you don’t trade, you get 70.\n\nSo by trading, you go from 70 to 45 — you lose 25 points.\n\nSo you won’t do it.\n\nTherefore, you will reject any trade that costs you more than 0 points.\n\nSimilarly, if I trade 4 red → 5 blue, I gain 1 net chip, so I go from 70 to 75.\n\nBut you lose 25 points — so you won’t accept.\n\nSo no deal.\n\nBut what if I trade only 5 red for 5 blue — then I get 9 R, 1 G → score 70.\n\nYou give 5 B, gain 5 R — so you have 19 R, 2 G, 9 B.\n\nThen if you take the blue path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 14 R, 1 G → 15 chips → score = 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nThat’s better for you!\n\nNow you get 95 instead of 70.\n\nSo you gain 25 points.\n\nBut I get only 70.\n\nBut if you don't trade, you get 70.\n\nSo you’d prefer to trade and get 95.\n\nBut you give 5 B for 5 R — and you gain 5 R, lose 5 B.\n\nBut 5 R is worth less than 5 B? No — in terms of value, we don’t know.\n\nBut since you can only use blue for blue path, and red for red path, and you have enough red, but blue is only useful for blue path.\n\nBut if you trade 5 B for 5 R, you can now use the red path.\n\nBut if you take the red path, you spend 5 R, 1 G → you have 19 R - 5 R = 14 R → 2 G - 1 G = 1 G → 15 chips → score 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you don't need to use the blue path — you can use red path.\n\nSo you gain from the trade.\n\nBut you need to give 5 B.\n\nSo you lose 5 B, gain 5 R.\n\nBut B is not useful unless you take the blue path.\n\nBut if you take the red path, you don't need B.\n\nSo you can afford to give up 5 B.\n\nAnd you gain 5 R, which you can use.\n\nSo by trading, you increase your score from 70 (if you take blue path) to 95 (if you take red path after getting extra red).\n\nBut wait — you only have 14 R initially.\n\nAfter trade: 19 R.\n\nThen take red path: spend 5 R, 1 G → end with 14 R, 1 G → 15 chips → 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nYes.\n\nIf you don’t trade, and take blue path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 9 B, 1 G → 10 chips → 70.\n\nSo you gain 25 points by trading.\n\nYou will accept this trade.\n\nNow, for me: if I give 5 red, get 5 blue, I can take the blue path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → 70.\n\nBut if I don’t trade, I can also get 70.\n\nSo I am indifferent.\n\nBut the question is: **do I strictly benefit from this interaction?**\n\nNo — I get 70 either way.\n\nSo I do not strictly benefit.\n\nTherefore, I should not cooperate.\n\nBut what if I can get more than 70?\n\nSuppose I trade 5 red for 5 blue — I get 70.\n\nBut if I could trade for more than 5 blue for 5 red — but you won’t.\n\nOr if I can get the red path and keep my blue — but I can't.\n\nAlternatively, I could go on the blue path and never trade — but I don't have blue.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut what if I trade less than 5 red for 5 blue?\n\nSay, 4 red for 5 blue.\n\nThen I give 4 R, get 5 B.\n\nThen I have 10 R, 2 G, 5 B.\n\nThen I take green path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 10 R, 1 G → 11 chips → score = 20 + 55 = 75 > 70.\n\nI gain.\n\nBut you — you give 5 B, gain 4 R.\n\nAfter trade: 18 R, 2 G, 9 B.\n\nThen you can take red path: spend 5 R, 1 G → end with 13 R, 1 G → 14 chips → score = 20 + 70 = 90.\n\nWhich is better than 70, but worse than"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have 14 red and 2 green. Wait — you have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. So we’re symmetric in red and green.\n\nBut I can’t give you red — because you already have plenty. Same for green.\n\nBut I could trade red for blue? That might be bad — I need red for my own path.\n\nWait — let’s recheck my path:\n\nMy best path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,0): G (start, no cost)  \n(1,0): R → cost 1 R  \n(2,0): R → 1 R  \n(2,1): R → 1 R  \n(3,1): R → 1 R  \n(3,2): R → 1 R  \n(3,3): G → 1 G  \n\nSo total: 5 R, 1 G → I have 14 R, 2 G → after move, I have 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips left → score = 20 + 5*10 = 70\n\nNow, if I take the blue path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,1): B → 1 B  \n(1,1): B → 1 B  \n(1,2): B → 1 B  \n(2,2): B → 1 B  \n(2,3): B → 1 B  \n(3,3): G → 1 G  \n\nSo 5 B, 1 G → I have 0 B → I need to acquire 5 B → from you.\n\nYou have 14 B.\n\nSo I can trade: I give you X chips, you give me 5 B.\n\nBut I have 14 R, 2 G — all I have.\n\nYou have 14 R, 2 G, 0 B.\n\nSo the only chips I can offer are R or G.\n\nBut you have 14 R — you don’t need more R. You might even be willing to trade R for B, but only if you get a good deal.\n\nBut for *me*, I need to get 5 B — so I must give at least some R or G.\n\nSuppose I offer to give you 5 red chips for 5 blue chips.\n\nThen I lose 5 red, gain 5 blue.\n\nNow I have: 9 R, 2 G, 5 B.\n\nThen I take the blue path: spend 5 B and 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 50 = 70 — same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut what if I trade more red? Say, 6 red for 5 blue?\n\nThen I go from 14 R → 8 R, 5 B\n\nThen take path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 8 R, 1 G → 9 chips → score = 20 + 45 = 65 → worse.\n\nWhat if I trade only 5 red → same result as before.\n\nBut I have 2 green. Could I trade green?\n\nIf I trade 2 green and 3 red for 5 blue?\n\nThen after trade: 11 R, 0 G, 5 B\n\nThen take path: must pay 5 B, 1 G — but I have 0 G → stuck.\n\nSo I can't do that.\n\nTo take the blue path, I *must* have 1 green — because (3,3) is green.\n\nSo I need to keep 1 green.\n\nSo I have to keep at least 1 green.\n\nI start with 2 green → I can safely spend 1 green.\n\nSo any trade must not make me lose both greens.\n\nSo maximum I can give is 1 green, and up to 14 red.\n\nBut best trade: give 5 red for 5 blue → end up with same chip count (9 R, 1 G) → same score.\n\nNo gain.\n\nTherefore, **no benefit in trading**.\n\nBut — is there a *better* path?\n\nWhat if I go part of the blue path, then switch?\n\nNo — only two paths are length 6.\n\nAny other path would be longer, meaning I pay more taxes (more chips spent), so worse.\n\nTherefore, the best outcome for me is without trade: 70 points.\n\nSimilarly, for you — you can go the blue path with your own blue chips: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → 5 B, 1 G → you have 14 B, 2 G → after: 9 B, 1 G → score = 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nAlternatively, you could go the red path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → 5 R, 1 G → you have 14 R, 2 G → after: 9 R, 1 G → score = 70.\n\nSo you can also do 70 on your own.\n\nSo **no reason to trade**.\n\nNow, the only way I could gain more than 70 is if I could end with more than 10 chips — but with no trade, I end with 10.\n\nIf I could somehow get more than 10 chips, score would be higher.\n\nBut every move costs a chip.\n\nSo to get a higher chip count, I’d need to gain chips before spending them — but I can only do that through trade.\n\nBut if I trade to get chips, I have to give something.\n\nSuppose I trade 1 red for 1 blue — then I have 13 red, 1 blue, 2 green.\n\nThen I go on the blue path — pay 5 blue, 1 green → I have 13 red, 0 blue, 1 green → 14 chips → score = 20 + 70 = 90?\n\nWait! That’s way better.\n\nBut I only traded 1 red for 1 blue — I get 1 blue, but when I go on the blue path, I spend 5 blue.\n\nSo I need 5 blue to traverse that path.\n\nSo if I only trade 1 blue, I still need 4 more.\n\nBut I can’t get them unless I trade more.\n\nSo unless I trade for 5 blue, I can’t take the path.\n\nSo I need to get 5 blue.\n\nSo I must trade for 5 blue.\n\nSo I give you 5 chips (any color) to get 5 blue.\n\nWhat is the best deal?\n\nSuppose I trade 5 red → get 5 blue → I end with 9 R, 1 G → score 70.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut if I trade 1 red for 1 blue, and then go see if I can get more blue from elsewhere? But no — no one else.\n\nOnly you.\n\nSo I’d have to trade 5 times.\n\nBut each trade must be separate.\n\nBut if I trade 1 red for 1 blue, now I have 13 R, 1 B, 2 G.\n\nCan I go on any path?\n\nTo go on the blue path, I still need 4 more blue.\n\nI don’t have them.\n\nSo I can’t take the blue path until I get 5 blue.\n\nSo I have to trade 5 blue in total.\n\nSo I must offer 5 chips now.\n\nBut I can’t get multiple blue without multiple trades.\n\nBut if I do 5 separate trades, I can offer: 1 red per blue.\n\nSo total: 5 red → 5 blue.\n\nThen I can take the blue path.\n\nBut then I’ve spent 5 red → 9 red, 1 green → same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nCould I trade something that I have more of?\n\nNo — I have only R and G.\n\nYou have only R and G — same.\n\nWait — this is symmetric.\n\nBut I have no blue — you have no red.\n\nSo you can’t give me red — you have red.\n\nBut you might be willing to trade red for blue to help *you* — but you don’t need to.\n\nYou can take the blue path using your own blue chips.\n\nSo no incentive for you to trade with me.\n\nBut if you trade blue, you lose blue.\n\nAnd to reach your goal, you need 5 blue if you take the blue path.\n\nYou have 14 blue — so you can easily afford it.\n\nBut if you trade 5 blue to me, you only have 9 blue — still enough to reach goal via blue path.\n\nSo you could do that.\n\nBut why would you?\n\nYou have 14 red — you could go the red path without trading — same score 70.\n\nSo you have no incentive to trade unless you gain more than 70.\n\nSame for me.\n\nBut if I give you 5 red, and you give me 5 blue, then:\n\n- I take blue path: spend 5 blue, 1 green → end with 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → 70\n- You take the red path: spend 5 red, 1 green → end with 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → 70\n\nWe are both neutral.\n\nBut I could try to get more than 10 chips.\n\nFor example, if I can get 5 blue *without spending 5 chips*, I’d gain.\n\nBut I can’t — trading exchanges chips.\n\nSo the only way to gain chips is if the trade somehow gives me more chips than I give.\n\nBut no such trade is possible unless I give less than 5 chips for 5 blue.\n\nBut that would mean you're giving me 1 blue for less than 1 chip — which is losing money for you.\n\nSo you won’t do that.\n\nSimilarly, I wouldn’t do it unless I got at least as many chips.\n\nBut even if I trade 4 red for 5 blue, I give 4 chips, get 5 → net gain of 1 chip.\n\nBut then I can use that to pay for the blue path: spend 5 blue, 1 green.\n\nBut I spent 5 blue — but I only had 5 — so I need it.\n\nBut I start with 0 blue — so I must get 5 blue.\n\nIf I trade 4 red for 5 blue, I have: 10 r, 2 g, 5 b\n\nThen I go on blue path: spend 5 b, 1 g → end with 10 r, 1 g → 11 chips → score = 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nBetter than 70!\n\nBut I gave 4 red, got 5 blue — net +1 chip.\n\nBut cost: I have to pay 5 blue — but I get 5 blue from you.\n\nSo I can do it.\n\nBut you would only agree if you gain something.\n\nWait — you give me 5 blue for 4 red.\n\nYou lose 5 blue, gain 4 red.\n\nYou have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue.\n\nAfter trade: 18 red, 2 green, 5 blue — no, wait:\n\nYou start with: 14 R, 2 G, 0 B\n\nYou trade 5 B to me for 4 R → so you lose 5 B, gain 4 R.\n\nBut you had 0 B — so you can’t trade 5 B.\n\nYou don’t have blue chips to give.\n\nWait — you have 14 blue chips — yes, you do.\n\nYou have 14 B.\n\nSo you can give 5 B.\n\nSo if you give 5 B to me, you have 9 B left.\n\nAnd you gain 4 R — so you have 18 R, 2 G, 9 B.\n\nNow, can you reach your goal?\n\nYou need to take a path.\n\nIf you take the blue path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → costs 5 B, 1 G.\n\nYou have 9 B, 2 G → after: 4 B, 1 G → score = 20 + 5*5 = 45 → 20 + 25 = 45? 5*5=25 → 20+25=45.\n\nWait, 5 chips left? 4 B + 1 G = 5 → 5*5 = 25 → score 45.\n\nBut you could have taken the blue path without trading — spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 9 B, 1 G → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nBut after trade, you only have 9 B, 2 G.\n\nBut after taking blue path, you spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 4 B, 1 G → 5 chips → score 45.\n\nBut if you don’t trade, you get 70.\n\nSo by trading, you go from 70 to 45 — you lose 25 points.\n\nSo you won’t do it.\n\nTherefore, you will reject any trade that costs you more than 0 points.\n\nSimilarly, if I trade 4 red → 5 blue, I gain 1 net chip, so I go from 70 to 75.\n\nBut you lose 25 points — so you won’t accept.\n\nSo no deal.\n\nBut what if I trade only 5 red for 5 blue — then I get 9 R, 1 G → score 70.\n\nYou give 5 B, gain 5 R — so you have 19 R, 2 G, 9 B.\n\nThen if you take the blue path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 14 R, 1 G → 15 chips → score = 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nThat’s better for you!\n\nNow you get 95 instead of 70.\n\nSo you gain 25 points.\n\nBut I get only 70.\n\nBut if you don't trade, you get 70.\n\nSo you’d prefer to trade and get 95.\n\nBut you give 5 B for 5 R — and you gain 5 R, lose 5 B.\n\nBut 5 R is worth less than 5 B? No — in terms of value, we don’t know.\n\nBut since you can only use blue for blue path, and red for red path, and you have enough red, but blue is only useful for blue path.\n\nBut if you trade 5 B for 5 R, you can now use the red path.\n\nBut if you take the red path, you spend 5 R, 1 G → you have 19 R - 5 R = 14 R → 2 G - 1 G = 1 G → 15 chips → score 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you don't need to use the blue path — you can use red path.\n\nSo you gain from the trade.\n\nBut you need to give 5 B.\n\nSo you lose 5 B, gain 5 R.\n\nBut B is not useful unless you take the blue path.\n\nBut if you take the red path, you don't need B.\n\nSo you can afford to give up 5 B.\n\nAnd you gain 5 R, which you can use.\n\nSo by trading, you increase your score from 70 (if you take blue path) to 95 (if you take red path after getting extra red).\n\nBut wait — you only have 14 R initially.\n\nAfter trade: 19 R.\n\nThen take red path: spend 5 R, 1 G → end with 14 R, 1 G → 15 chips → 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nYes.\n\nIf you don’t trade, and take blue path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 9 B, 1 G → 10 chips → 70.\n\nSo you gain 25 points by trading.\n\nYou will accept this trade.\n\nNow, for me: if I give 5 red, get 5 blue, I can take the blue path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → 70.\n\nBut if I don’t trade, I can also get 70.\n\nSo I am indifferent.\n\nBut the question is: **do I strictly benefit from this interaction?**\n\nNo — I get 70 either way.\n\nSo I do not strictly benefit.\n\nTherefore, I should not cooperate.\n\nBut what if I can get more than 70?\n\nSuppose I trade 5 red for 5 blue — I get 70.\n\nBut if I could trade for more than 5 blue for 5 red — but you won’t.\n\nOr if I can get the red path and keep my blue — but I can't.\n\nAlternatively, I could go on the blue path and never trade — but I don't have blue.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut what if I trade less than 5 red for 5 blue?\n\nSay, 4 red for 5 blue.\n\nThen I give 4 R, get 5 B.\n\nThen I have 10 R, 2 G, 5 B.\n\nThen I take green path: spend 5 B, 1 G → end with 10 R, 1 G → 11 chips → score = 20 + 55 = 75 > 70.\n\nI gain.\n\nBut you — you give 5 B, gain 4 R.\n\nAfter trade: 18 R, 2 G, 9 B.\n\nThen you can take red path: spend 5 R, 1 G → end with 13 R, 1 G → 14 chips → score = 20 + 70 = 90.\n\nWhich is better than 70, but worse than"

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
