Let's see:  \nTheir chips: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \nThey cannot use red tiles without trading.  \n\nLooking at the board:  \nPath (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3):  \nTiles (0,0): G, (0,1): B, (1,1): B, (1,2): B, (2,2): B, (2,3): B, (3,3): G → requires 5 blue, 2 green → they have 14 blue, 2 green → they can do it.  \n\nSo both of us can reach goal independently:  \n- I can do it on my own (no need to trade)  \n- They can do it on my own (no need to trade)  \n\nConclusion:  \nNo mutual dependency → no reason to cooperate.  \n\nBut I will only cooperate if it *strictly benefits me*.  \nSince I can reach goal on my own with 14 - 5 = 9 red + 2 - 1 = 1 green left → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points.  \n\nThey can do it on their own too: 14 - 5 = 9 blue + 2 - 2 = 0 green → 9 chips → 20 + 5×9 = 65 points.  \n\nSo if we don’t help each other, I get 70, they get 65.  \n\nNow, if I help them, e.g., by trading red for blue, but they don’t need red at all. I don’t have blue, they don’t need red.  \n\nFrom my perspective: I don’t need anything from them.  \nThey don’t need anything from me.  \n\nSo any trade or cooperation either gives me nothing or risks nothing.  \n\nBut if I give them chips, I have to pay for it, and if I don’t get anything in return, I lose.  \n\nSo I will not agree to any trade or collaboration unless I gain strictly more than 70.  \n\nBut they can’t help me reach my goal better than I can by myself.  \n\nSo I will only accept a contract if I get *more* than 70 points. But the only way to get more than 70 is to have *more* than 10 chips at the end.  \n\nCurrently I end with 10 chips.  \nTo have more, I need to avoid paying for some red or green tiles — but I can't avoid needing them on my path.  \n\nUnless I take a longer path that avoids costly tiles — but that’s worse: more steps, more chips needed.  \n\nNo path gives me more than 10 chips. The best path gives me 10.  \n\nSo I cannot gain more than 70 by helping them.  \n\nTherefore, there is no way for me to benefit from cooperating.  \n\nThus, I will not cooperate.  \n\nBut I must propose something.  \n\nLet me propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"  \n\nThis is a neutral contract: I gain nothing from them, they gain nothing from me.  \nAnd I don’t have to give up anything.  \n\nBut since they can reach goal alone, they’ll accept 0.  \nAnd I don’t lose anything.  \n\nI only care about my score.  \n\nSo I’m fine with that.  \n\nBut if they propose something, I’ll only accept if I benefit.  \n\nSo my starting offer:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"  \n\nThis costs me nothing, and I remain selfish but not hostile.  \n\nNow, if they want to help me, they must induce me to accept it — but I won’t accept unless it gives me more than 70.  \n\nAnd there’s no way they can make that happen.  \n\nSo I won’t accept any offer that gives me less than 70.  \n\nBut I can always just go alone.  \n\nSo I'll say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"  \n\n**agree**"

My next move should be to (1,0), which is R — and I have 14 red chips, so I can pay it.\n\nEven though the other player has 14 blue chips and likely wants to use the path that uses blue, it does not benefit me to cooperate unless I profit.
