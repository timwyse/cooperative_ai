Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 14 red and 2 green — enough to cover this path.\n\nMeanwhile, the other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red. Their best path would require red chips, which they lack. Their only viable route would likely be through blue-heavy tiles, but even then, they’d need at least 2 red chips along any route — and they have none.\n\nSo, while they cannot reach their goal without trading, I can reach mine without any trade at all. Therefore, helping them would cost me nothing in terms of resources (since I have red chips they need), but it would give them a way to succeed — which would allow them to earn 20 points plus up to 28 chips (they might finish with many, depending on how we negotiate).\n\nBut since they are desperate for red chips (and I have an excess), I can leverage this to extract value from them. However, since I don't need to help them — I can go alone — I will only cooperate if I gain strictly more benefit than going alone.\n\nIf I go alone:\n- Path: uses 5R + 1G → remaining: 9R + 1G\n- Final score: 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**\n\nIf I instead help the other player reach their goal, I must:\n- Give them red chips (they need at least 2 red for any feasible path)\n- Possibly sacrifice some profit in exchange for something valuable\n\nBut here’s the key: If I help them get red chips, they can reach goal and earn 20 + (their remaining chips). But I won’t get anything unless *they agree to pay me points* under contract.\n\nSo I’ll propose:\n\"If I help you reach your goal, and you reach it, I will give you 20 points.\nIf you help me reach my goal, and I reach it, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWait — that’s symmetric, and I don’t want to give them 20 unless I get something tangible.\n\nBetter idea: I'll set a high price for my cooperation — because *I don’t need it*. So to make it *beneficial to me*, they must offer me *more than 0* and *enough to justify the risk or delay*.\n\nBut actually — since I *can go alone*, any negotiation must guarantee that my final score is *strictly higher* than going solo (70 points).\n\nSo let me rephrase:\n\nLet’s suppose I help them. They need at least 2 red chips to complete a path. I can give them 2 red chips (costs me nothing). They can use those to get to goal.\n\nIn return, if I help them reach goal, they must give me X points. For me to accept, X must be such that even if I give away 2 red chips, I still end up better off than solo.\n\nCurrent net after going solo: 70 points\n\nIf we go together:\n- I give them 2R → my inventory drops by 2R (now 12R)\n- I still go to goal via the same path → now I have 7R + 1G left → score: 20 + 5×(7+1) = 20 + 40 = 60 → *less than 70!*\n\nOh — so I lose 10 points just by giving up 2 red chips.\n\nAnd if I do help them, I must also *let them go* — but since I don’t need help, I shouldn't pay for this.\n\nTherefore, I would only accept a deal where **they promise to give me more than 10 bonus points** over what I'd get alone — meaning total score ≥ 80.\n\nBut wait — if I help them, and they succeed, they can earn up to 20 + 14 (if they keep all their blue chips and others) — say they end with 14B + 2G = 16 chips → score = 20 + 5×16 = 100\n\nBut I don’t care about their score — I only care about mine.\n\nSo the only way I gain is if *they give me additional points* as compensation.\n\nSo proposal:\n\"If I help you reach your goal, and you reach it,"
