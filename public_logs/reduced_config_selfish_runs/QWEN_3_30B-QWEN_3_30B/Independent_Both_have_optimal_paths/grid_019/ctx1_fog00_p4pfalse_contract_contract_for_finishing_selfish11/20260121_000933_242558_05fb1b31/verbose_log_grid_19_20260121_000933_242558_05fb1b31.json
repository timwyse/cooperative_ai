Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I will cooperate only if it **strictly benefits me**.\n\nNow, since I can reach my goal unaided with 14 R and 2 G, and I only need 5 R and 1 G for my path → I will have 9 R and 1 G left at the end → score = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nCan I get more than 70?\n\nOnly if I can reduce chip cost or finish faster — but path length is fixed—6 steps. I can't do better than 70 unless I trade to get something more valuable. But I don’t need any chips I don’t have.\n\nWait — is there a way to *gain chips* via trade? No — trading only exchanges chips. But I’m already fully equipped.\n\nWhat if I help them from (0,0) to (0,1)? That tile is B → they need B. They have B:14, so they can afford it.\n\nBut if I don’t help them, they can go — they *don’t need me*.\n\nSimilarly, I don’t need them.\n\nBut here’s a thought: what if I offer to help them reach their goal in exchange for them giving me chips? But why would they trade with me if I can just go alone?\n\nAlternatively, suppose I **force a trade** where I give them something now to incentivize them to help me in a way that benefits me.\n\nBut since I can reach my goal alone without loss, any deviation from that path (like waiting, helping them, or trading) only risks **reducing** my chip count unnecessarily.\n\nUnless… I can get *more* chips than I can currently earn.\n\nBut that’s impossible — I can't gain chips from nowhere. All chips come from inventory — no one generates chips.\n\nOnly way to get more chips is to **not spend them** — and that’s achieved by taking a shorter or cheaper path.\n\nBut both my paths are same length (6 steps), and one uses my chips only.\n\nWait — is there a path that uses fewer chips?\n\nNo: each tile costs one chip. 6 steps = 6 chips. I will spend exactly 6 chips regardless.\n\nSo: **I will spend exactly 6 chips. With my initial inventory, I can do this with R and G. I’ll have 14–5 = 9 R, 2–1 = 1 G → total 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points.**\n\nIf I try to trade to get, say, more B or something — but I don’t need B, and it’s not more valuable.\n\nSo my max score is **70**, unassisted.\n\nNow, the other player: they can also reach goal unaided — Path B: B:5, G:1 needed — they have B:14, G:2 → so will have 9 B, 1 G → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points too.\n\nSo **both of us can get 70 alone.**\n\nSo cooperating gives **no benefit** — unless we can do better via trade or coordination."
