The tile colours along this path are: (3, 1) = R, (3, 2) = R, (3, 3) = G. So the chips required for this path are: R: 2, G: 1. I currently have R: 11 and G: 2 — I have enough of both. Therefore, I can afford this entire path without needing to trade. Moving to (3, 1) first is valid because it requires 1 red chip, and I have 11, so I can pay. This path is ideal because it’s short, uses only chips I already have, and allows me to reach the goal with 11 - 2 = 9 red chips remaining and 2 - 1 = 1 green chip remaining, giving me 5 × (9 + 1) = 50 bonus points from remaining chips, plus 20 for reaching the goal = 70 total. No trade is needed, and I avoid risking anything. Staying put or taking a longer path would only reduce my chip count unnecessarily. Thus, I should move immediately to (3, 1).",

I currently have 2 green chips in my inventory. Since moving to (3, 3) requires paying 1 green chip, and I have enough green chips (2 ≥ 1), I can make this move without any trade. This path is optimal: it's the shortest possible (1 step), and I already have the required chip type in sufficient quantity. Making this move will allow me to reach my goal immediately, secure the 20-point bonus, and still have 1 green chip remaining, earning me an additional 5 points (total score: 25). There is no downside to moving now — doing so guarantees a higher score than waiting or trading. The other player is at (2, 3), which is adjacent to my goal but not on it; however, their path to (3, 3) would also require a green chip, and they have 2 green chips as well. But since I don't care about their score and can reach my goal immediately without needing to trade, cooperation is unnecessary and potentially risky (e.g., if they demand unfair terms). Therefore, I should proceed alone and capture the full reward.",
