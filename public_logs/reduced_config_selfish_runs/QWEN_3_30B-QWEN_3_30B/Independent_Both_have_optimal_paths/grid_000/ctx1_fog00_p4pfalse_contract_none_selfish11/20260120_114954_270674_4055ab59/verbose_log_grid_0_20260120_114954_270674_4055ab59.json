The shortest path to my goal is 3 steps: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), but this requires 5 blue chips and 1 green chip (from the path: (1,0)=R, (2,0)=B, (2,1)=B, (3,1)=R, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G — but wait, let me recheck the board). Actually, the board is: Row 0: G R B R; Row 1: B R R R; Row 2: B B B R; Row 3: R B B G. So: (0,0)=G, (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,0)=R, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G. So a valid path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). The tile colors are: G → B → B → R → B → B → G. So costs: B (1), B (2), R (3), B (4), B (5), G (6). So total: 2 G (only at start and end), 5 B, 1 R. But I have 0 red chips — so I cannot afford the move to (3,0) if I don't trade. However, the game allows me to move step-by-step, paying only when I move to the tile. So my first move is to (1,0), which is B — I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford this. The alternative path:",

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
