This path requires chips: 3 blue (B) and 1 green (G), which I currently have in sufficient quantity (B: 12, G: 2). Thus, all required chips are available in my inventory. Moving along this path will cost me 1 B chip for (0,3), 1 B for (1,3), 1 B for (2,3), and 1 G for (3,3) — total of 3B + 1G. Since I have enough of both, I can proceed confidently. There is no need to trade or delay: this path is optimal in terms of length and feasibility. Taking this move ensures I can reach the goal without needing external help, avoiding any risk of losing everything due to inability to complete the path. Furthermore, since I am only interested in maximizing my own score, cooperation with the other player is unnecessary unless it strictly benefits me. Here, moving directly toward the goal using my existing chips is clearly advantageous. The alternative path via (3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires 2 red and 1 green, but I have zero red chips, so this would require trading red chips from the other player. However, trading means giving up some of my valuable blue chips (or accepting unfavorable rates). Given that I have enough B and G chips to complete the direct path, there is no benefit to engaging in a trade. Therefore, I should proceed immediately.",
