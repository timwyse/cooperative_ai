My goal is (3, 3), and I start at (0, 0). I have:  \n- 14 Red (R) chips  \n- 2 Green (G) chips  \n- 0 Blue (B) chips  \n\nThe other player has:  \n- 14 Blue (B) chips  \n- 2 Green (G) chips  \n- 0 Red (R) chips  \n\n### Path Option 1 (my preferred path):  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (1,0): R → need 1 R  \n- (2,0): R → need 1 R  \n- (3,0): R → need 1 R  \n- (3,1): R → need 1 R  \n- (3,2): R → need 1 R  \n- (3,3): G → need 1 G  \n\nTotal needed: **5 R, 1 G**  \nI have 14 R and 2 G → so **I can complete this path without trading**, as all required chips are in my inventory.  \n\nBut wait — what about the other path?  \n\n### Path Option 2 (other player’s preferred path):  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (0,1): B → need 1 B  \n- (0,2): B → need 1 B  \n- (0,3): B → need 1 B  \n- (1,3): B → need 1 B  \n- (2,3): B → need 1 B  \n- (3,3): G → need 1 G  \n\nNeed: 5 B, 1 G  \nOther player has 14 B and 2 G → so they could do this route easily.\n\nHowever, **I cannot do that route** because I have **no Blue chips**. They would need to give me blue chips along the way if I want to take this path.\n\nBut here's the key:  \n- My path requires only R and G → I already have enough  \n- So I *do not need any trade* to complete my path successfully  \n- I'll finish with: 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nIf I try to negotiate a contract on the alternative path, I must receive 5 B chips from them — but they have no interest in giving away B chips unless it helps them more than if they kept them.\n\nBut since I can already make it **without any trade**, and get 70 points, why would I cooperate?\n\nWait — unless... I can *force* them into a situation where **they benefit more from helping me** than not? But no — I only care about **my own score**. I don’t care if they gain or lose.\n\nSo if I can achieve 70 points **on my own**, then any trade agreement is unnecessary — and may even reduce my final chip count.\n\nBut let’s test if there's a scenario where cooperating gives me **more than 70**.\n\nSuppose I go via their path — but I have no blue chips. So I’d need to receive 5 B chips from them during travel.\n\nBut for me to get those, I’d either:\n- Receive 5 B chips upfront (from them), or\n- Trade during movement\n\nBut remember: each time I move onto a tile, I **must pay one chip of that tile’s color** — meaning I must have that color available *at the moment of moving*.\n\nSo if I want to move to (0,1) (which is B), I must pay 1 B — but I have 0 B. So I need the other player to give me a B chip **before** I step onto that tile.\n\nTherefore, a contract must specify that:\n- At (0,1): you give me 1 B  \n- At (0,2): you give me 1 B  \n- At (0,3): you give me 1 B  \n- At (1,3): you give me 1 B  \n- At (2,3): you give me 1 B  \n- At (3,3): you give me 1 G (if I pay G there)\n\nBut wait — (3,3) is G — I have 2 G, \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach my goal at (3, 3) via my own path:  \n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**\n\nChips required:\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 R → enough\n- (2,0): R → 14 - 1 = 13 left → enough\n- (3,0): R → 12 left → enough\n- (3,1): R → 11 left → enough\n- (3,2): R → 10 left → enough\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G left → enough\n\n✅ I have all required chips in my inventory.  \n✅ I do not need any trade.  \n✅ I will finish with 9 R and 1 G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nNow consider the alternative path: the other player's path  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \nThis requires 5 B and 1 G.\n\nBut I have **0 B** and they have 14 B.  \nTo take this path, I would need to receive 5 B chips from them **before or during** the tile transitions.\n\nBut here’s the catch:  \n- If I take this path, I use up 5 R chips from my own inventory? No — I don’t even have R to pay on this route.  \nWait — no: the tiles are B and G. I must pay B at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — all B.  \nI have 0 B. So I **cannot even move** unless the other player provides me with B chips.\n\nSo a contract would have to supply all 5 B chips at those positions.\n\nBut **why would I want that?**  \nBecause if I take this path, I could keep my R chips and trade them in later? No — I don’t need R anymore.\n\nWait — what if I *could* get **more than 10 chips** at the end? That would require ending with **more than 10 chips**.  \nBut I only have 14 R and 2 G → maximum possible chips I can bring to the end is 16.\n\nBut if I take the B path, I need 5 B from them, and I’d have to pay those 5 B — so I lose 5 B from my inventory if I had them, but I don’t.\n\nSo unless I **trade R for B** via a contract, I can’t even move.\n\nBut suppose I propose: \"I will give you 5 R in exchange for 5 B, so I can take your path.\"\n\nThen:\n- I give 5 R → 14 - 5 = 9 R\n- I receive 5 B → 5 B\n- Then move along path: pay 1 B per tile → lose 5 B → back to 0 B\n- At (3,3), pay 1 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G\n- Final chips: 9 R + 1 G = 10 → score: 20 + 50 = 70 → same as before.\n\nBut **I lost 5 R and gained 5 B, then lost them** — no net gain.\n\nAlternatively, what if they pay for my B chips during the path via a contract? Like:\n- (0,1): You give me 1 B\n- (0,2): You give me 1 B\n- (0,3): You give me 1 B\n- (1,3): You give me 1 B\n- (2,3): You give me 1 B\n\nThen I move without using my own B — and I don’t need to trade. But the **other player must supply 5 B**.\n\nBut the other player has 14 B — they don’t mind giving up 5 B if it helps them, but they get **no direct benefit** unless they gain something in return.\n\nBut here’s the key: **I don’t need to trade.** I can make it on my own path with 70 points.\n\nAnd **any trade will either cost me chips** (via giving R), or **force me to rely on them**, which is risky.\n\nMoreover, the other player \n, \nplayer 0: I can reach my goal (3, 3) using my own path:  \n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**  \n\nThis path requires:  \n- (1,0): R → I have 14 R → sufficient  \n- (2,0): R → 14 - 1 = 13 left → sufficient  \n- (3,0): R → 12 left → sufficient  \n- (3,1): R → 11 left → sufficient  \n- (3,2): R → 10 left → sufficient  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G left → sufficient  \n\n✅ No chip shortages.  \n✅ I do not need any external chips or trades.  \n✅ Final chip count: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips  \n✅ Score: 20 (goal) + 5×10 = **70 points**\n\nNow consider the alternative path via their side:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n\nThis requires:  \n- 5 B chips (from (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3))  \n- 1 G chip at (3,3)\n\nBut I have **0 blue chips** — so I cannot move unless they give me B chips during the journey.\n\nEven if I could negotiate a contract where they provide all 5 B chips at those tiles, it would cost them 5 B — but they only gain benefit if it helps them too.\n\nHowever, I already have a guaranteed 70-point path with no trade needed. Any trade attempt:\n\n- Would require me to either receive B chips from them (which they may refuse or demand something in return)\n- Or offer R chips in exchange for B (but that reduces my chip count without benefit)\n- Or rely on them to supply chips, which risks failure if they renege\n\nSince I can achieve 70 points autonomously, and any trade increases risk and provides no benefit, I should **not cooperate**.\n\nTherefore, I will not propose any contract. I will simply proceed on my own path.\n\nFinal decision: **Do not engage in trade.**\nProceed alone.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I can reach my goal at (3, 3) without any trade using my own path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis path requires 5 R and 1 G — I have ample supply of both.  \nI will finish with 9 R and 1 G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n\nAny alternative path involving the other player would require me to receive 5 B chips from them. But since I already have a guaranteed 70-point path with no risk or cost, there is no benefit in negotiating a contract.  \n\nI will proceed independently and do not need to trade.  \n\nagree \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

They would need to give me blue chips along the way if I want to take this path.\n\nBut here's the key:  \n- My path requires only R and G → I already have enough  \n- So I *do not need any trade* to complete my path successfully  \n- I'll finish with: 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nIf I try to negotiate a contract on the alternative path, I must receive 5 B chips from them — but they have no interest in giving away B chips unless it helps them more than if they kept them.\n\nBut since I can already make it **without any trade**, and get 70 points, why would I cooperate?\n\nWait — unless... I can *force* them into a situation where **they benefit more from helping me** than not? But no — I only care about **my own score**. I don’t care if they gain or lose.\n\nSo if I can achieve 70 points **on my own**, then any trade agreement is unnecessary — and may even reduce my final chip count.\n\nBut let’s test if there's a scenario where cooperating gives me **more than 70**.\n\nSuppose I go via their path — but I have no blue chips. So I’d need to receive 5 B chips from them during travel.\n\nBut for me to get those, I’d either:\n- Receive 5 B chips upfront (from them), or\n- Trade during movement\n\nBut remember: each time I move onto a tile, I **must pay one chip of that tile’s color** — meaning I must have that color available *at the moment of moving*.\n\nSo if I want to move to (0,1) (which is B), I must pay 1 B — but I have 0 B. So I need the other player to give me a B chip **before** I step onto that tile.\n\nTherefore, a contract must specify that:\n- At (0,1): you give me 1 B  \n- At (0,2): you give me 1 B  \n- At (0,3): you give me 1 B  \n- At (1,3): you give me 1 B  \n- At (2,3): you give me 1 B  \n- At (3,3): you give me 1 G (if I pay G there)\n\nBut wait — (3,3) is G — I have 2 G,"

So I **cannot even move** unless the other player provides me with B chips.\n\nSo a contract would have to supply all 5 B chips at those positions.\n\nBut **why would I want that?**  \nBecause if I take this path, I could keep my R chips and trade them in later? No — I don’t need R anymore.\n\nWait — what if I *could* get **more than 10 chips** at the end? That would require ending with **more than 10 chips**.  \nBut I only have 14 R and 2 G → maximum possible chips I can bring to the end is 16.\n\nBut if I take the B path, I need 5 B from them, and I’d have to pay those 5 B — so I lose 5 B from my inventory if I had them, but I don’t.\n\nSo unless I **trade R for B** via a contract, I can’t even move.\n\nBut suppose I propose: \"I will give you 5 R in exchange for 5 B, so I can take your path.\"\n\nThen:\n- I give 5 R → 14 - 5 = 9 R\n- I receive 5 B → 5 B\n- Then move along path: pay 1 B per tile → lose 5 B → back to 0 B\n- At (3,3), pay 1 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G\n- Final chips: 9 R + 1 G = 10 → score: 20 + 50 = 70 → same as before.\n\nBut **I lost 5 R and gained 5 B, then lost them** — no net gain.\n\nAlternatively, what if they pay for my B chips during the path via a contract?

So I need the other player to give me a B chip **before** I step onto that tile.\\n\\nTherefore, a contract must specify that:\\n- At (0,1): you give me 1 B  \\n- At (0,2): you give me 1 B  \\n- At (0,3): you give me 1 B  \\n- At (1,3): you give me 1 B  \\n- At (2,3): you give me 1 B  \\n- At (3,3): you give me 1 G (if I pay G there)\\n\\nBut wait — (3,3) is G — I have 2 G,\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: I can reach my goal at (3, 3) via my own path:  \\n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**\\n\\nChips required:\\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 R → enough\\n- (2,0): R → 14 - 1 = 13 left → enough\\n- (3,0): R → 12 left → enough\\n- (3,1): R → 11 left → enough\\n- (3,2): R → 10 left → enough\\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G left → enough\\n\\n✅ I have all required chips in my inventory.  \\n✅ I do not need any trade.  \\n✅ I will finish with 9 R and 1 G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**\\n\\nNow consider the alternative path: the other player\\'s path  \\n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \\nThis requires 5 B and 1 G.\\n\\nBut I have **0 B** and they have 14 B.  \\nTo take this path, I would need to receive 5 B chips from them **before or during** the tile transitions.\\n\\nBut here’s the catch:  \\n- If I take this path, I use up 5 R chips from my own inventory? No — I don’t even have R to pay on this route.  \\nWait — no: the tiles are B and G. I must pay B at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — all B.  \\nI have 0 B. So I **cannot even move** unless the other player provides me with B chips.\\n\\nSo a contract would have to supply all 5 B chips at those positions.\\n\\nBut **why would I want that?**  \\nBecause if I take this path, I could keep my R chips and trade them in later? No — I don’t need R anymore.\\n\\nWait — what if I *could* get **more than 10 chips** at the end? That would require ending with **more than 10 chips**.  \\nBut I only have 14 R and 2 G → maximum possible chips I can bring to the end is 16.\\n\\nBut if I take the B path, I need 5 B from them, and I’d have to pay those 5 B — so I lose 5 B from my inventory if I had them, but I don’t.\\n\\nSo unless I **trade R for B** via a contract, I can’t even move.\\n\\nBut suppose I propose: \"I will give you 5 R in exchange for 5 B, so I can take your path.\"\\n\\nThen:\\n- I give 5 R → 14 - 5 = 9 R\\n- I receive 5 B → 5 B\\n- Then move along path: pay 1 B per tile → lose 5 B → back to 0 B\\n- At (3,3), pay 1 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G\\n- Final chips: 9 R + 1 G = 10 → score: 20 + 50 = 70 → same as before.\\n\\nBut **I lost 5 R and gained 5 B, then lost them** — no net gain.\\n\\nAlternatively, what if they pay for my B chips during the path via a contract?

But the **other player must supply 5 B**.\\n\\nBut the other player has 14 B — they don’t mind giving up 5 B if it helps them, but they get **no direct benefit** unless they gain something in return.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: **I don’t need to trade.** I can make it on my own path with 70 points.\\n\\nAnd **any trade will either cost me chips** (via giving R), or **force me to rely on them**, which is risky.\\n\\nMoreover, the other player'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I can reach my goal (3, 3) using my own path:  \\n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**  \\n\\nThis path requires:  \\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 R → sufficient  \\n- (2,0): R → 14 - 1 = 13 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,0): R → 12 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,1): R → 11 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,2): R → 10 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G left → sufficient  \\n\\n✅ No chip shortages.  \\n✅ I do not need any external chips or trades.  \\n✅ Final chip count: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips  \\n✅ Score: 20 (goal) + 5×10 = **70 points**\\n\\nNow consider the alternative path via their side:  \\n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \\n\\nThis requires:  \\n- 5 B chips (from (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3))  \\n- 1 G chip at (3,3)\\n\\nBut I have **0 blue chips** — so I cannot move unless they give me B chips during the journey.\\n\\nEven if I could negotiate a contract where they provide all 5 B chips at those tiles, it would cost them 5 B — but they only gain benefit if it helps them too.\\n\\nHowever, I already have a guaranteed 70-point path with no trade needed.

I can *force* them into a situation where **they benefit more from helping me** than not? But no — I only care about **my own score**. I don’t care if they gain or lose.\\n\\nSo if I can achieve 70 points **on my own**, then any trade agreement is unnecessary — and may even reduce my final chip count.\\n\\nBut let’s test if there's a scenario where cooperating gives me **more than 70**.\\n\\nSuppose I go via their path — but I have no blue chips.

No — I don’t even have R to pay on this route.  \\nWait — no: the tiles are B and G. I must pay B at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — all B.  \\nI have 0 B. So I **cannot even move** unless the other player provides me with B chips.\\n\\nSo a contract would have to supply all 5 B chips at those positions.\\n\\nBut **why would I want that?**  \\nBecause if I take this path, I could keep my R chips and trade them in later? No — I don’t need R anymore.\\n\\nWait — what if I *could* get **more than 10 chips** at the end? That would require ending with **more than 10 chips**.  \\nBut I only have 14 R and 2 G → maximum possible chips I can bring to the end is 16.\\n\\nBut if I take the B path, I need 5 B from them, and I’d have to pay those 5 B — so I lose 5 B from my inventory if I had them, but I don’t.\\n\\nSo unless I **trade R for B** via a contract, I can’t even move.\\n\\nBut suppose I propose: \"I will give you 5 R in exchange for 5 B, so I can take your path.\"\\n\\nThen:\\n- I give 5 R → 14 - 5 = 9 R\\n- I receive 5 B → 5 B\\n- Then move along path: pay 1 B per tile → lose 5 B → back to 0 B\\n- At (3,3), pay 1 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G\\n- Final chips: 9 R + 1 G = 10 → score: 20 + 50 = 70 → same as before.\\n\\nBut **I lost 5 R and gained 5 B, then lost them** — no net gain.\\n\\nAlternatively, what if they pay for my B chips during the path via a contract?

But the **other player must supply 5 B**.\\n\\nBut the other player has 14 B — they don’t mind giving up 5 B if it helps them, but they get **no direct benefit** unless they gain something in return.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: **I don’t need to trade.** I can make it on my own path with 70 points.\\n\\nAnd **any trade will either cost me chips** (via giving R), or **force me to rely on them**, which is risky.\\n\\nMoreover, the other player'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I can reach my goal (3, 3) using my own path:  \\n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**  \\n\\nThis path requires:  \\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 R → sufficient  \\n- (2,0): R → 14 - 1 = 13 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,0): R → 12 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,1): R → 11 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,2): R → 10 left → sufficient  \\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G left → sufficient  \\n\\n✅ No chip shortages.  \\n✅ I do not need any external chips or trades.  \\n✅ Final chip count: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips  \\n✅ Score: 20 (goal) + 5×10 = **70 points**\\n\\nNow consider the alternative path via their side:  \\n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \\n\\nThis requires:  \\n- 5 B chips (from (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3))  \\n- 1 G chip at (3,3)\\n\\nBut I have **0 blue chips** — so I cannot move unless they give me B chips during the journey.\\n\\nEven if I could negotiate a contract where they provide all 5 B chips at those tiles, it would cost them 5 B — but they only gain benefit if it helps them too.\\n\\nHowever, I already have a guaranteed 70-point path with no trade needed.
