Since I have 12 blue chips, I can afford this move (cost: 1 blue chip). Taking this path avoids any need for trading, which reduces risk and preserves all my chips for scoring. The alternative shorter path (via (2, 1)) requires red chips, which I do not have, and would require trading with the other player. However, since they have 11 red chips and I have none, any trade would be costly (likely needing to give more than one blue or green chip per red).
