I currently have {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, so I have enough B and G chips to cover this entire path. The next move is to (0,3), which is a blue tile. Since I have 12 blue chips, I can afford to pay 1 blue chip to move there. Moving toward my goal using my existing inventory avoids needing any trade, which reduces risk and preserves chip count. Even if I could trade later, doing so would only be beneficial if it gives me more net chips by the end. But I already have all the necessary chips for this path, so trading isn't needed. Proceeding directly maximizes my chance of finishing with high chip count (since every leftover chip gives +5 points). I will not consider alternative paths that require red chips (which are in high supply with the other player) because I’d have to trade for them, and I don’t gain anything from helping the other player unless I benefit strictly.

I currently have 10 blue and 2 green chips, so I can afford both moves in the path. Moving to (2,3) requires paying 1 blue chip—this is in my inventory, so it's feasible. From (2,3), the next move to (3,3) requires 1 green chip, which I also have. Thus, I can complete the path without needing to trade. This path is optimal: short (only 2 steps), uses only chips I already have, and leaves me with 9 blue and 1 green chip at the end. If I don't move now, I risk giving the other player time to block my path or forcing me into a trade that may weaken my final chip count. Since I don’t need to trade and can reach the goal safely with high chip retention, I should move immediately.",
