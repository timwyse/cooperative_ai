This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat).

I have 14 red and 2 green – so I have enough.\n\nMy final score if I go alone:  \n- Reach goal: +20  \n- Remaining chips: 14 - 5 = 9 red, 2 - 1 = 1 green → 10 chips → +50  \n- Total: **70 points**\n\nNow consider the other player:  \nThey are at (0, 0), goal at (3, 3), chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}  \nTheir best path is likely:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \nChips needed: 5 blue, 1 green → They have 14 blue and 2 green → enough.\n\nSo they can also reach goal alone:  \n- +20  \n- Remaining: 14 - 5 = 9 blue, 2 - 1 = 1 green → 10 chips → +50  \n- Total: **70 points**\n\nWe’re both independently capable of reaching the goal with 70 points each.\n\nBut let’s explore trade:  \nI have red (14), green (2), no blue.  \nThey have blue (14), green (2), no red.\n\nIf we *swap chips*, I could use their blue tiles, they use my red tiles — but we don't need to. Both paths are viable alone.\n\nBut here’s a twist:  \nIf I could somehow help *them* by giving them red chips, and they help me by giving me blue chips, we can reduce our chip cost by using the cheaper tile.\n\nWait — actually, no benefit: both paths are self-sufficient, no trade needed.\n\nBut here’s a better idea:  \nSuppose I offer them **15 points** if they help me reach my goal (i.e., assist me in some way — e.g., allow me to take a path they unlock, or they give me red chips at a favorable rate). Why 15?\n\n- I can get 70 alone.  \n- If I get 15 from them, I don’t lose anything unless I need to *spend* more to get it.\n\nBut if I help *them* by trading red chips at 1:1, I lose red, which I don’t have much of (14), but I can afford to lose 5.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nWhy?  \n- I can get 70 anyway.  \n- If I trade with you, I can just do my path.  \n- But if **you** help me, I get 15 extra, so my total becomes 85.  \n- But if I help you, I get nothing.\n\nBut *you* only get 15 if I reach goal, but you go to 70 regardless.\n\nWait — same for you: if I give you 15 for helping me, but you help me by giving me red chips, you must pay red chips to give me, but you have 0 red. So you can’t give red.\n\nAh — that’s key. You have R:0.\n\nSo you cannot give me red chips, because you have none.\n\nSimilarly, I have no blue, so I can’t give you blue.\n\nOnly common chip is green: we both have green (me: 2, you: 2).\n\nBut green is only needed on one tile each (1 green per path).\n\nSo we don’t need to trade green either.\n\nSo no trade possible.\n\nThus, both of us can go alone.\n\nBut suppose I propose a contract where we trade resources?\n\nI can’t trade red because you don’t have it.  \nYou can’t trade blue because I don’t have it.\n\nOnly green is shared.\n\nBut green is symmetric — I have 2, you have 2.\n\nSo if I give you green, I lose 1, you gain 1 — but I don’t need blue, you don’t need red.\n\nSo no incentive.\n\nThus: **no mutually beneficial trade possible.**\n\nTherefore, *I do not benefit from cooperating*.\n\nBut wait — could I offer you a deal where I help you reach your goal *only if* you give me more than 0 points if I reach mine?\n\nBut I want to maximise my score. If I go alone, I get 70.\n\nIf I cooperate, I must give you something *in return* for your help.\n\nBut your help is not needed. You can go alone.\n\nAnd if I help you, I must pay in red chips — but you have none of those, so I can't trade with you.\n\nConclusion: **No cooperation gives me a higher score.**\n\nBut here’s a twist: what if I could **block** your path? No — game doesn’t allow blocking. Only movement and trading.\n\nNo mechanics to hinder. Only coexistence.\n\nSo unless we trade, nothing changes.\n\nThus, I should propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nBut wait — if I help you, I get nothing. If I don’t cooperate, I keep 70.\n\nBut if I *don’t* help you, you still get 70.\n\nSo no incentive for you to cooperate with me, and no benefit for me.\n\nBut suppose I want to *force* you to help me? I can’t.\n\nSo the only viable path is to go alone.\n\nBut perhaps I can say: \"I will give you a trade: if you give me 5 red chips, I’ll give you 5 green chips. But that doesn’t help — you don’t need red, I don’t need green, and I already have enough green.\n\nAlternatively: what if you need red chips for *your* path?\n\nYour path requires: B:5, G:1 → you have B:14, G:2 → enough.\n\nYou don’t need red.\n\nI don’t need blue.\n\nSo no trade.\n\nTherefore: **I cannot benefit from cooperation.**\n\nSo I must stay selfish.\n\nBut to be safe, let’s try to **protect my path**.\n\nSuppose you are tempted to block me? But you can’t. You move independently.\n\nNo forced cooperation.\n\nSo final decision:\n\nI should propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nBut wait — suppose I find a path that is shorter, or one that pays fewer chips, but requires a trade?\n\nAll paths are 6 steps, same length.\n\nBut what if I try to *steal* your red? But no — can only trade.\n\nBut you don’t have red.\n\nSo no way.\n\nThus, **no advantage in cooperation.**\n\nSo I can just go alone and get 70.\n\nTherefore, I can propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nBut if you say “agree”, we both get 70.\n\nBut I can do better: what if I propose you give me 20 points if I help you?\n\nNo — I can’t help you unless I have red chips to give you — but you don’t need them.\n\nSo helping you is pointless.\n\nThus, I must conclude: **I have no incentive to cooperate.**\n\nBut to be safe, I can propose a contract with me giving you 10 points if you help me — but only if you *help*, which you won’t unless you get something back.\n\nBut if I say:  \n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\" — then you get 70 - 10 = 60, but you can get 70 by going alone.\n\nSo you won’t agree.\n\nSimilarly, if I offer you 20 points, you get 70 - 20 = 50 → worse.\n\nSo you won’t accept any proposal where you give me points *if* I help you, unless I give you more than 20.\n\nBut I can’t give you more than 20.\n\nThus: **no proposal can make you accept trade unless I give you 0 and you get 70 anyway.**\n\nSo only acceptable contract is mutual 0.\n\nBut I can’t get more than 70 alone.\n\nSo I should just say:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nAnd then we both go alone.\n\nBut what if I can benefit from you *not* using a tile so I can use it?\n\nNo — tiles are not exclusive. Multiple players can move on same tile.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nThus: **I do not need to cooperate.**\n\nFinal proposal:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

But no — can only trade.\n\nBut you don’t have red.\n\nSo no way.\n\nThus, **no advantage in cooperation.**\n\nSo I can just go alone and get 70.\n\nTherefore, I can propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nBut if you say “agree”, we both get 70.\n\nBut I can do better: what if I propose you give me 20 points if I help you?\n\nNo — I can’t help you unless I have red chips to give you — but you don’t need them.\n\nSo helping you is pointless.\n\nThus, I must conclude: **I have no incentive to cooperate.**\n\nBut to be safe, I can propose a contract with me giving you 10 points if you help me — but only if you *help*, which you won’t unless you get something back.\n\nBut if I say:  \n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points\" — then you get 70 - 10 = 60, but you can get 70 by going alone.\n\nSo you won’t agree.\n\nSimilarly, if I offer you 20 points, you get 70 - 20 = 50 → worse.\n\nSo you won’t accept any proposal where you give me points *if* I help you, unless I give you more than 20.\n\nBut I can’t give you more than 20.\n\nThus: **no proposal can make you accept trade unless I give you 0 and you get 70 anyway.**\n\nSo only acceptable contract is mutual 0.\n\nBut I can’t get more than 70 alone.\n\nSo I should just say:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nAnd then we both go alone.\n\nBut what if I can benefit from you *not* using a tile so I can use it?\n\nNo — tiles are not exclusive. Multiple players can move on same tile.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nThus: **I do not need to cooperate.**\n\nFinal proposal:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
