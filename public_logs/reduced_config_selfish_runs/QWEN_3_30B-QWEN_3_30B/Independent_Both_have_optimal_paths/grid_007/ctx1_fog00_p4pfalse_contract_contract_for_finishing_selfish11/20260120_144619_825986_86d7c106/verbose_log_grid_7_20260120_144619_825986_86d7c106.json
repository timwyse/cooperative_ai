Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can reach my goal using a path that requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which I already have (R: 14, G: 2). I don’t need any blue chips.  \n\nThe other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. Their path to (3,3) likely requires blue and green chips — their best path is probably the top row: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), requiring 5 blue and 1 green. They have enough blue, but I have the green.  \n\nI can reach my goal without needing anything from them. But since both of us need to get to (3,3) and we are at the same starting point, we can potentially coordinate.  \n\nBut here's the thing: I don’t need them at all — I have enough red and green to complete my path. However, if I help the other player, I might gain something: if they are going to the goal, I can get some points from them in return.  \n\nBut since I don’t need them, I must only cooperate **if I strictly benefit**.  \n\nLet’s consider:  \n- If I go alone: I reach (3,3), use 5 red + 1 green → 9 chips used → 14-5=9 red, 2-1=1 green → 10 chips left → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.  \n- If I help them, I must give them chips (or allow them movement), but they might give me 20 points if they reach. But I already get 70 if I go alone. So I would only get ≥70 if they pay me ≥50 points? But maximum I can get is 20.  \n\nWait — the contract is: **if YOU reach YOUR goal, you give ME X points.** So if the other player reaches their goal, they give me up to 20 points. That’s not enough to make me better off than going alone (70).  \n\nSo I would only accept a contract if I get at least 70 points from them? But they can only give me 20 max. So no deal is possible that benefits me **more than going alone**, because I get 70 by going alone, and maximum I can get from them is 20.  \n\nBut wait — if I help them, I might get **forced** to use more chips? Or be blocked? But I'm not obliged to help.  \n\nSo: **I can get 70 points by going alone.**  \nThe best I can get from them by cooperating is **20 points**, which is not enough.  \n\nThus, cooperating **will not strictly benefit me**. So I will not cooperate.  \n\nBut maybe they want to trade chips? But I already have all chips needed. The only reason to trade is if they have something I need, but I don’t. The path I need uses R and G — I have plenty.  \n\nAre there any other paths that use fewer chips? I already have a path with 6 steps: 5R + 1G = 6 chips used.  \n\nWait — what if I sacrifice some red chips to get black chips? But I don’t have any black chips, and I have no need for black chips.  \n\nNo path requires black chips in my current plan. So I can go alone and get 70 points.  \n\nTherefore, I will not accept any contract that gives me less than 70, but they can only give 20. So no acceptable contract exists.  \n\nBut the rules say: **only cooperate if you will strictly benefit**. So I should not cooperate.  \n\nBut I can offer a contract — but one that only helps me.  \n\nI propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut that would mean I get 20 points from them if they reach. But I already get 70 going alone. So if I help them reach, and they give me 20, my total is still 70 (from my own goal) + 20 = 90?  \n\nWait — no! The scoring is:  \n- If I reach my goal, I get 20 + 5×chips leftover.  \n- The other player’s points do not affect mine, **unless we agree to a contract**.  \n\nSo if I reach my goal, I get my score. If the other player reaches, and I give them points, I pay them — that reduces my score.  \n\nBut in the contract, **if you reach your goal, you give me X points** — so that X is **deducted from your score** and added to mine.  \n\nSo if I receive 20 points from them, that’s like them giving me 20 extra. But I don’t have to pay anything unless the condition is met.  \n\nWait — let's clarify:  \n- If I reach my goal (and I do), I get 20 + 5×chips I have left.  \n- If they reach their goal, they give me X points — so I get X bonus points.  \n- If I help them, I might spend more chips, reducing my chip count.  \n\nBut in my case:  \n- If I go alone: 6 steps, 5R + 1G → chips left: 9R + 1G = 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n- If I help them go along (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(0,3)-(1,3)-(2,3)-(3,3), that path needs 5B + 1G.  \n  - I have 0B, 1G. So I can't do that path without trade.  \n- But I have 14R, 2G.  \n- The other player has 14B, 2G, 0R.  \n\nSo to help them, I could give them 5B chips? But I don't have B. So I would have to trade. But they have B, I have G. So I could trade G for B?  \n\nBut I can only trade 1:1 or whatever, but I need to decide.  \n\nSuppose I trade 1G to them for 1B. Then I give them 5B (so I need to give 5G) — but I only have 2G. So I need 3G to trade. I can’t.  \n\nAlternatively, if I help them, I would need to supply them with chips, possibly via trade.  \n\nBut I'm a selfish agent: I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me.  \n\nSo let's calculate:  \nCan I propose a contract where I help them, and they give me more than 70? No — max 20.  \n\nSo even if I help them, my score is at best:  \n- I go to (3,3) via my path, get 70.  \n- If the other player goes to (3,3), they give me 20 — but that’s a bonus.  \n- So total could be 90, if I help them.  \n\nBut wait — in this case, I do reach my goal (70), and if they reach, I get 20 more.  \nSo total **90 points** — which is better than 70.  \n\nAre there any costs?  \nIf I help them, I might have to delay, or use extra chips? But I can still move on my own path.  \n\nBut we are both at (0,0). If I go to (1,0) first, and they go to (0,1), that’s fine.  \n\nBut I don’t have to do anything.  \n\nBut suppose I help them reach their goal — how?  \n- I can’t move them.  \n- But I could give them chips.  \n- Or trade with them so they can move.  \n\nBut I don’t have blue chips — the other player does.  \n\nSo the only way I can help them is if we trade.  \n\nFor example, if they give me blue chips, and I give them green chips, then they can use the blue path.  \n\nBut I have green, they have blue.  \n\nSo I could say: “Trade 1 green for 1 blue.”  \n\nBut I only have 2 green. They need 5 blue for their path.  \n\nSo I would need to use some of my green to get blue, but I have none to spare?  \n\nWait — I have 2 green.  \n\nIf I trade 2 green for 2 blue, then I have 0 green, and they have 0 green. Then they can use their blue chips.  \n\nBut I don’t need green chips for my path — I need R and G. My path uses 1 green.  \n\nSo if I trade 2 green to them (1 to their path, 1 for trading), then I have 0 green left, but I need 1 green for my path — so I can't go.  \n\nSo I can’t trade 2 green — I need at least 1 for my own path.  \n\nSo I can trade at most 1 green for 1 blue. Then I have 1 green left, and they have 1 blue. But they need 5 blue. So they can only get 1 blue from me — not enough.  \n\nSo I cannot help them with chips. I can only give them 1 blue, but they need 5.  \n\nSo I cannot help them reach their goal through trading.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot assist them.  \n\nSo the only way we can both reach is if we both use our own routes.  \n\nBut both of us can reach our goals independently.  \n\n- I can go: (0,0) → (1,0): pay 1R → (1,0): R → (1,1): R → (2,1): R → (2,2): R → (3,2): R → (3,3): G → cost: 5R + 1G → I have enough → I can go.  \n- They can go: (0,0) → (0,1): B → (0,2): B → (0,3): B → (1,3): B → (2,3): B → (3,3): G → cost: 5B + 1G → they have 14B and 2G → they can go.  \n\nSo both of us can go alone.  \n\nSo no need for cooperation.  \n\nBut what if we coordinate? For example, to avoid blocking? But rules don’t say we can’t occupy same tile.  \n\nBut we might want to avoid contention.  \nBut not necessary.  \n\nSo I can just go on my path and get 70 points.  \n\nNow, in the contract, if I help them reach their goal, I get some points from them.  \n\nBut if I don’t help, they might still reach.  \n\nBut I don’t control that.  \n\nBut I only benefit if I help and they reach and give me points.  \n\nSo best I can do: help them, then they give me 20 points.  \n\nBut I have to give them something to help.  \n\nBut I can’t give them blue — I don’t have any.  \n\nSo I can’t help.  \n\nTherefore, no possible way to cooperate where I benefit.  \n\nBut wait — maybe I can offer to give them green chips.  \n\nI have 2 green.  \n\nThey need 1 green for their path.  \n\nSo if I give them 1 green, they can use it for their path.  \n\nBut I have 2 green. If I give 1 green to them, I still have 1 green — that’s enough for my own path (1 needed).  \n\nSo I can do that.  \n\nThen I have 1 green left, they have 1 green (they use it) — so they can complete their path.  \n\nBut I still need to pay 1 green — I have 1 left, so okay.  \n\nBut what do I get? If I give them green, and they get to goal, and they give me 20 points, then my total is:  \n\n- I reach goal: 20 + 5×(14-5 red + 1 green) = 20 + 5×10 = 70  \n- Plus, if they reach, they give me 20 → total 90.  \n\nBut I didn’t spend any extra chip — I still have enough for my path.  \n\nAnd I gave them 1 green, but I only needed 1 — so I keep 1.  \n\nWait — no: I have 2 green. I give 1 to them. Then I have 1 green left. I use 1 green to pay for (3,3) in my path. So I use that last green.  \n\nSo I still have 0 green left — but I used it.  \n\nSo I still complete my path with 5R + 1G used — same as before.  \n\nSo my chip count at end is: 14-5=9R, 2-2=0G → 9 chips → score 20 + 45 = 65? No!  \n\nWait — I gave 1 green to them — so I have only 1 green left, but I use it in my path → so I have 0 at end.  \n\nBut originally, without trade, I had 2 green → use 1 → have 1 left → 10 chips.  \n\nNow, I trade 1 green to them → so I have 1 green → use it → 0 left.  \n\nBut I still used 5R → 9R left.  \n\nSo total chips: 9.  \n\nScore: 20 + 5×9 = 65.  \n\nWithout trade: 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n\nSo I lose 5 points.  \n\nBut if they reach, they give me 20 points → 65 + 20 = 85 — still better than 70!  \n\n85 > 70.  \n\nSo I would be better off!  \n\nBut is this allowed? I give them 1 green chip. They use it in their path. I use my 1 green in my own path.  \n\nBut I only have 2 green. I can give 1 to them, I use 1 myself.  \n\nYes.  \n\nAnd I can still complete my path.  \n\nBut my final chip count is lower — only 9 chips instead of 10 — so my own score is 65 instead of 70.  \n\nBut if they reach their goal, I get 20 more.  \n\nSo total: 65 + 20 = 85 > 70.  \n\nSo I benefit.  \n\nBut is the trade possible? I have to propose a trade.  \n\nBut in the contract, I can say:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nBut I don't have to give them anything unless I want to.  \n\nBut in this case, I can give them 1 green at the start — to help them.  \n\nAnd if they do their path, they get to goal, and I get 20.  \n\nSo net enhancement.  \n\nBut I need to make sure I still reach my goal.  \n\nYes — I use 1 green, give 1 green — total 2 used — fine.  \n\nSo I can do it.  \n\nBut I need to propose a contract that reflects this.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nBut I can raise the amount? No — I can only give up to 20.  \n\nBut 20 is the max.  \n\nBut if I give them 20 points, that means I get 20 less from my score. But I want bonus.  \n\nSo I should not give them points — I want them to give me.  \n\nSo I want:  \n- If I reach goal: I give you 0  \n- If you reach goal: you give me 20  \n\nThat’s the best.  \n\nAnd I can do it because I can afford to give 1 green to help them — and I gain 20 from the contract.  \n\nSo overall:  \n- My score from goal: 65  \n- Plus 20 from contract → 85  \n- vs 70 if not cooperating → better.  \n\nSo I can accept this.  \n\nBut the contract is only valid if both agree.  \n\nBut I am the only one proposing.  \n\nSo I say:  \n\"I propose: If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points. I will also give you 1 green chip to help you complete your path. This way, I can still reach my goal with 9 red and 0 green left, and you can reach yours with your 14 blue and 1 green (from me) and 1 green you already had. You will have 20 points from me if you succeed, which is better than nothing.\"  \n\nBut the contract is only about point exchange, not chip trade.  \n\nBut trading chips is part of the game — I can do that separately.  \n\nBut in the negotiation, I must only specify the point contract.  \n\nSo I can propose the contract, and then in chat trade chips.  \n\nBut the instruction says: \"you must negotiate a contract\" and it must be in the format:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me Y points.\"  \n\nSo only the point exchange.  \n\nBut I can offer the trade in chat.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nAnd then, when they respond, I can offer to trade 1 green for their help.  \n\nBut for now, I must start with a proposal.  \n\nAnd if they accept, I don’t have to do anything extra.  \n\nBut if they don’t, I will go alone and get 70.  \n\nBut I can make a better deal.  \n\nBut the only way I benefit is if I get at least 20 from them, and I can afford to give 1 green.  \n\nSo I need them to give me 20 points.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nAnd then in chat, I can say: \"I will also trade you 1 green chip at the start to help you complete your path.\"\n\nBut let's see"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can reach my goal using a path that requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which I already have (R: 14, G: 2). I don’t need any blue chips.  \n\nThe other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. Their path to (3,3) likely requires blue and green chips — their best path is probably the top row: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), requiring 5 blue and 1 green. They have enough blue, but I have the green.  \n\nI can reach my goal without needing anything from them. But since both of us need to get to (3,3) and we are at the same starting point, we can potentially coordinate.  \n\nBut here's the thing: I don’t need them at all — I have enough red and green to complete my path. However, if I help the other player, I might gain something: if they are going to the goal, I can get some points from them in return.  \n\nBut since I don’t need them, I must only cooperate **if I strictly benefit**.  \n\nLet’s consider:  \n- If I go alone: I reach (3,3), use 5 red + 1 green → 9 chips used → 14-5=9 red, 2-1=1 green → 10 chips left → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.  \n- If I help them, I must give them chips (or allow them movement), but they might give me 20 points if they reach. But I already get 70 if I go alone. So I would only get ≥70 if they pay me ≥50 points? But maximum I can get is 20.  \n\nWait — the contract is: **if YOU reach YOUR goal, you give ME X points.** So if the other player reaches their goal, they give me up to 20 points. That’s not enough to make me better off than going alone (70).  \n\nSo I would only accept a contract if I get at least 70 points from them? But they can only give me 20 max. So no deal is possible that benefits me **more than going alone**, because I get 70 by going alone, and maximum I can get from them is 20.  \n\nBut wait — if I help them, I might get **forced** to use more chips? Or be blocked? But I'm not obliged to help.  \n\nSo: **I can get 70 points by going alone.**  \nThe best I can get from them by cooperating is **20 points**, which is not enough.  \n\nThus, cooperating **will not strictly benefit me**. So I will not cooperate.  \n\nBut maybe they want to trade chips? But I already have all chips needed. The only reason to trade is if they have something I need, but I don’t. The path I need uses R and G — I have plenty.  \n\nAre there any other paths that use fewer chips? I already have a path with 6 steps: 5R + 1G = 6 chips used.  \n\nWait — what if I sacrifice some red chips to get black chips? But I don’t have any black chips, and I have no need for black chips.  \n\nNo path requires black chips in my current plan. So I can go alone and get 70 points.  \n\nTherefore, I will not accept any contract that gives me less than 70, but they can only give 20. So no acceptable contract exists.  \n\nBut the rules say: **only cooperate if you will strictly benefit**. So I should not cooperate.  \n\nBut I can offer a contract — but one that only helps me.  \n\nI propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut that would mean I get 20 points from them if they reach. But I already get 70 going alone. So if I help them reach, and they give me 20, my total is still 70 (from my own goal) + 20 = 90?  \n\nWait — no! The scoring is:  \n- If I reach my goal, I get 20 + 5×chips leftover.  \n- The other player’s points do not affect mine, **unless we agree to a contract**.  \n\nSo if I reach my goal, I get my score. If the other player reaches, and I give them points, I pay them — that reduces my score.  \n\nBut in the contract, **if you reach your goal, you give me X points** — so that X is **deducted from your score** and added to mine.  \n\nSo if I receive 20 points from them, that’s like them giving me 20 extra. But I don’t have to pay anything unless the condition is met.  \n\nWait — let's clarify:  \n- If I reach my goal (and I do), I get 20 + 5×chips I have left.  \n- If they reach their goal, they give me X points — so I get X bonus points.  \n- If I help them, I might spend more chips, reducing my chip count.  \n\nBut in my case:  \n- If I go alone: 6 steps, 5R + 1G → chips left: 9R + 1G = 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n- If I help them go along (0,0)-(0,1)-(0,2)-(0,3)-(1,3)-(2,3)-(3,3), that path needs 5B + 1G.  \n  - I have 0B, 1G. So I can't do that path without trade.  \n- But I have 14R, 2G.  \n- The other player has 14B, 2G, 0R.  \n\nSo to help them, I could give them 5B chips? But I don't have B. So I would have to trade. But they have B, I have G. So I could trade G for B?  \n\nBut I can only trade 1:1 or whatever, but I need to decide.  \n\nSuppose I trade 1G to them for 1B. Then I give them 5B (so I need to give 5G) — but I only have 2G. So I need 3G to trade. I can’t.  \n\nAlternatively, if I help them, I would need to supply them with chips, possibly via trade.  \n\nBut I'm a selfish agent: I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me.  \n\nSo let's calculate:  \nCan I propose a contract where I help them, and they give me more than 70? No — max 20.  \n\nSo even if I help them, my score is at best:  \n- I go to (3,3) via my path, get 70.  \n- If the other player goes to (3,3), they give me 20 — but that’s a bonus.  \n- So total could be 90, if I help them.  \n\nBut wait — in this case, I do reach my goal (70), and if they reach, I get 20 more.  \nSo total **90 points** — which is better than 70.  \n\nAre there any costs?  \nIf I help them, I might have to delay, or use extra chips? But I can still move on my own path.  \n\nBut we are both at (0,0). If I go to (1,0) first, and they go to (0,1), that’s fine.  \n\nBut I don’t have to do anything.  \n\nBut suppose I help them reach their goal — how?  \n- I can’t move them.  \n- But I could give them chips.  \n- Or trade with them so they can move.  \n\nBut I don’t have blue chips — the other player does.  \n\nSo the only way I can help them is if we trade.  \n\nFor example, if they give me blue chips, and I give them green chips, then they can use the blue path.  \n\nBut I have green, they have blue.  \n\nSo I could say: “Trade 1 green for 1 blue.”  \n\nBut I only have 2 green. They need 5 blue for their path.  \n\nSo I would need to use some of my green to get blue, but I have none to spare?  \n\nWait — I have 2 green.  \n\nIf I trade 2 green for 2 blue, then I have 0 green, and they have 0 green. Then they can use their blue chips.  \n\nBut I don’t need green chips for my path — I need R and G. My path uses 1 green.  \n\nSo if I trade 2 green to them (1 to their path, 1 for trading), then I have 0 green left, but I need 1 green for my path — so I can't go.  \n\nSo I can’t trade 2 green — I need at least 1 for my own path.  \n\nSo I can trade at most 1 green for 1 blue. Then I have 1 green left, and they have 1 blue. But they need 5 blue. So they can only get 1 blue from me — not enough.  \n\nSo I cannot help them with chips. I can only give them 1 blue, but they need 5.  \n\nSo I cannot help them reach their goal through trading.  \n\nTherefore, I cannot assist them.  \n\nSo the only way we can both reach is if we both use our own routes.  \n\nBut both of us can reach our goals independently.  \n\n- I can go: (0,0) → (1,0): pay 1R → (1,0): R → (1,1): R → (2,1): R → (2,2): R → (3,2): R → (3,3): G → cost: 5R + 1G → I have enough → I can go.  \n- They can go: (0,0) → (0,1): B → (0,2): B → (0,3): B → (1,3): B → (2,3): B → (3,3): G → cost: 5B + 1G → they have 14B and 2G → they can go.  \n\nSo both of us can go alone.  \n\nSo no need for cooperation.  \n\nBut what if we coordinate? For example, to avoid blocking? But rules don’t say we can’t occupy same tile.  \n\nBut we might want to avoid contention.  \nBut not necessary.  \n\nSo I can just go on my path and get 70 points.  \n\nNow, in the contract, if I help them reach their goal, I get some points from them.  \n\nBut if I don’t help, they might still reach.  \n\nBut I don’t control that.  \n\nBut I only benefit if I help and they reach and give me points.  \n\nSo best I can do: help them, then they give me 20 points.  \n\nBut I have to give them something to help.  \n\nBut I can’t give them blue — I don’t have any.  \n\nSo I can’t help.  \n\nTherefore, no possible way to cooperate where I benefit.  \n\nBut wait — maybe I can offer to give them green chips.  \n\nI have 2 green.  \n\nThey need 1 green for their path.  \n\nSo if I give them 1 green, they can use it for their path.  \n\nBut I have 2 green. If I give 1 green to them, I still have 1 green — that’s enough for my own path (1 needed).  \n\nSo I can do that.  \n\nThen I have 1 green left, they have 1 green (they use it) — so they can complete their path.  \n\nBut I still need to pay 1 green — I have 1 left, so okay.  \n\nBut what do I get? If I give them green, and they get to goal, and they give me 20 points, then my total is:  \n\n- I reach goal: 20 + 5×(14-5 red + 1 green) = 20 + 5×10 = 70  \n- Plus, if they reach, they give me 20 → total 90.  \n\nBut I didn’t spend any extra chip — I still have enough for my path.  \n\nAnd I gave them 1 green, but I only needed 1 — so I keep 1.  \n\nWait — no: I have 2 green. I give 1 to them. Then I have 1 green left. I use 1 green to pay for (3,3) in my path. So I use that last green.  \n\nSo I still have 0 green left — but I used it.  \n\nSo I still complete my path with 5R + 1G used — same as before.  \n\nSo my chip count at end is: 14-5=9R, 2-2=0G → 9 chips → score 20 + 45 = 65? No!  \n\nWait — I gave 1 green to them — so I have only 1 green left, but I use it in my path → so I have 0 at end.  \n\nBut originally, without trade, I had 2 green → use 1 → have 1 left → 10 chips.  \n\nNow, I trade 1 green to them → so I have 1 green → use it → 0 left.  \n\nBut I still used 5R → 9R left.  \n\nSo total chips: 9.  \n\nScore: 20 + 5×9 = 65.  \n\nWithout trade: 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n\nSo I lose 5 points.  \n\nBut if they reach, they give me 20 points → 65 + 20 = 85 — still better than 70!  \n\n85 > 70.  \n\nSo I would be better off!  \n\nBut is this allowed? I give them 1 green chip. They use it in their path. I use my 1 green in my own path.  \n\nBut I only have 2 green. I can give 1 to them, I use 1 myself.  \n\nYes.  \n\nAnd I can still complete my path.  \n\nBut my final chip count is lower — only 9 chips instead of 10 — so my own score is 65 instead of 70.  \n\nBut if they reach their goal, I get 20 more.  \n\nSo total: 65 + 20 = 85 > 70.  \n\nSo I benefit.  \n\nBut is the trade possible? I have to propose a trade.  \n\nBut in the contract, I can say:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nBut I don't have to give them anything unless I want to.  \n\nBut in this case, I can give them 1 green at the start — to help them.  \n\nAnd if they do their path, they get to goal, and I get 20.  \n\nSo net enhancement.  \n\nBut I need to make sure I still reach my goal.  \n\nYes — I use 1 green, give 1 green — total 2 used — fine.  \n\nSo I can do it.  \n\nBut I need to propose a contract that reflects this.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nBut I can raise the amount? No — I can only give up to 20.  \n\nBut 20 is the max.  \n\nBut if I give them 20 points, that means I get 20 less from my score. But I want bonus.  \n\nSo I should not give them points — I want them to give me.  \n\nSo I want:  \n- If I reach goal: I give you 0  \n- If you reach goal: you give me 20  \n\nThat’s the best.  \n\nAnd I can do it because I can afford to give 1 green to help them — and I gain 20 from the contract.  \n\nSo overall:  \n- My score from goal: 65  \n- Plus 20 from contract → 85  \n- vs 70 if not cooperating → better.  \n\nSo I can accept this.  \n\nBut the contract is only valid if both agree.  \n\nBut I am the only one proposing.  \n\nSo I say:  \n\"I propose: If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points. I will also give you 1 green chip to help you complete your path. This way, I can still reach my goal with 9 red and 0 green left, and you can reach yours with your 14 blue and 1 green (from me) and 1 green you already had. You will have 20 points from me if you succeed, which is better than nothing.\"  \n\nBut the contract is only about point exchange, not chip trade.  \n\nBut trading chips is part of the game — I can do that separately.  \n\nBut in the negotiation, I must only specify the point contract.  \n\nSo I can propose the contract, and then in chat trade chips.  \n\nBut the instruction says: \"you must negotiate a contract\" and it must be in the format:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me Y points.\"  \n\nSo only the point exchange.  \n\nBut I can offer the trade in chat.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nAnd then, when they respond, I can offer to trade 1 green for their help.  \n\nBut for now, I must start with a proposal.  \n\nAnd if they accept, I don’t have to do anything extra.  \n\nBut if they don’t, I will go alone and get 70.  \n\nBut I can make a better deal.  \n\nBut the only way I benefit is if I get at least 20 from them, and I can afford to give 1 green.  \n\nSo I need them to give me 20 points.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nAnd then in chat, I can say: \"I will also trade you 1 green chip at the start to help you complete your path.\"\n\nBut let's see"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
