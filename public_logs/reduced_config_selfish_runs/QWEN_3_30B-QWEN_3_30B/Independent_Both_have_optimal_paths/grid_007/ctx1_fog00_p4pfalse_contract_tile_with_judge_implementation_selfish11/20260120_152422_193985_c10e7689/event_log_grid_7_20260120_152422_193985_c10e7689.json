What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to facilitate our paths to (3, 3):\n\n- For the path I will take: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n  - This path requires: 5 red chips and 1 green chip (total 6 chips).\n  - I currently have: 14 R, 2 G — so I can cover R entirely, but only 2 G, so I need 1 G from you.\n  - Specifically:\n    - (1, 0): R → I pay using my R (no trade needed)\n    - (1, 1): R → I pay using my R\n    - (2, 1): R → I pay using my R\n    - (2, 2): R → I pay using my R\n    - (3, 2): R → I pay using my R → all R already covered.\n    - (3, 3): G → I need 1 G, and I have only 2 G in inventory? Wait — no, at start I have G:2, so I can use my own G here. So actually, this path does not require any trade — all required chips are in my inventory.\n\nWait — double-check:\n\nMy inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\nPath:  \n(0,0): start — no cost  \n(1,0): R → I have 14 R — ok  \n(1,1): R → ok  \n(2,1): R → ok  \n(2,2): R → ok  \n(3,2): R → ok  \n(3,3): G → I have 2 G — I can use one here.\n\nSo total chips used: 5 R + 1 G → all available. No trade needed!\n\nBut wait — the other player’s goal is also (3,3), and they’re at (0,0). Their path might be different.\n\nLet me check their options:\n\nThey have: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R\n\nTheir possible path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n(0,1): B → ok (they have 14 B)\n(0,2): B → ok\n(0,3): B → ok\n(1,3): B → ok\n(2,3): B → ok\n(3,3): G → they have 2 G → ok\n\nSo they can also complete it with no trade.\n\nTherefore: **We both can reach (3,3) without trading anything**, using our own chips.\n\nBut — would that be optimal?\n\nLet’s calculate final scores if we go alone:\n\n**If I take my path:**  \n- Use: 5 R + 1 G → left: 9 R, 1 G  \n- Reach goal → score = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\n**If I take the alternative path via (0,1)-(0,2)-(0,3)**:  \nThat path needs: (0,1): B, (0,2): B, (0,3): B, (1,3): B, (2,3): B, (3,3): G  \n→ 5 B + 1 G  \nBut I have 0 B → so I need to *get* 5 B from them.\n\nCould I get 5 B from them in exchange for 5 R? That is: trade 5 R for 5 B.\n\nThen I’d go: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nCosts: 5 B + 1 G → I give 5 R, get 5 B → net change: lose 5 R, gain 5 B\n\nEnding inventory: R: 9, B: 5, G: 1 → total chips: 15 → score = 20 + 5×15 = 95\n\nHigher than 70! So this is better.\n\nBut I need to **trade 5 R for 5 B** with the other player.\n\nSo I must ask: can I get 5 B from them?\n\nThey have 14 B — so yes, they can spare \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I propose the following contract to maximize my score:\n\n- For the path I will take: (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (0, 3) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n  - This path requires: 5 blue chips (on tiles (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)) and 1 green chip (on (3,3))\n  - I currently have: 0 B, 2 G, 14 R → so I need 5 B (from you) and can use my own G for (3,3)\n  - Therefore, I need 5 B from you at the following tiles:\n    - (0,1): You give me a B\n    - (0,2): You give me a B\n    - (0,3): You give me a B\n    - (1,3): You give me a B\n    - (2,3): You give me a B\n  - In exchange, I give you 5 R (to compensate for your B loss)\n\n- For your path: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n  - Your path requires: 5 red chips (on (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)) and 1 green chip (on (3,3))\n  - You have: 14 R, 2 G — so you can cover your own needs without trading.\n\nTherefore, no trade needed for your path. But I still need the 5 B from you.\n\nFinal terms:\n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,3): You give me a B  \n(2,3): You give me a B  \n\nIn exchange, I give you 5 R (you'll receive them when we settle the contract).\n\nThis allows me to reach goal with 9 R, 5 B, 1 G = 15 chips → score: 20 + 5×15 = 95\n\nYou keep your own chips and path: you'll use 5 R and 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nBut more importantly: this is **strictly better for me**, and you are not worse off — in fact, you gain 5 R (which you can use for future trades or save) while still reaching your goal.\n\nSo both of us reach our goals, but I get significantly more points.\n\nI am willing to proceed with this deal only if you agree to provide 5 B at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) in exchange for 5 R from me.\n\nIf you accept, I will go first on this path, and you can follow yours independently.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: (0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,3): You give me a B  \n(2,3): You give me a B  \n\nIn exchange, I give you 5 R.  \n\nThis contract allows me to reach the goal with 15 chips remaining → score: 95.  \nYou still reach your goal with 10 chips → score: 70.  \n\nYou gain 5 R, and I get the B I need.  \n\nNo risk to you — you still succeed. I benefit significantly.  \n\nI propose this contract is fair and mutually beneficial.  \n\n**agree** \n",
