Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, we may be able to help each other by exchanging chips at specific tiles.\n\nLet’s examine critical points:\n- (1,0): R → I need a red chip\n- (1,1): R → another red\n- (2,1): R → third red\n- (2,2): R → fourth red\n- (3,2): R → fifth red\n- (3,3): G → one green (but already available in my bag)\n\nWait — I have 2 green chips, so I don’t need to trade for green.\n\nBUT — all the reds are on my path where I currently have to use my own reds.\n\nHowever, if I do not trade, I will spend 5 red chips → end with 9 red, plus 2 green → score = 20 + 5×(9+2) = 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nBut what if I could avoid spending red chips entirely?\n\nAlternatively — consider your path:  \nYou're at (0,0), goal is (3,3). Your best path might go through blues or greens.\n\nYour path using your strong color (blue):  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nRequires: 5 blue chips, 1 green.\n\nYou have 14 blue, 2 green → can cover this easily.\n\nBut note: (0,3) is B, (1,3) is B, (2,3) is B, (3,3) is G — so 5 blue, plus 1 green at end (which you have).\n\nSo your path costs: B:5, G:1 → you can do it alone.\n\nNow here’s where cooperation helps:\n\nIf I go via (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), that’s 5 reds (at (1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2)) and 1 green (at (3,3)).\n\nBut I already have 2 green, so green isn’t a problem.\n\nBut I only have 14 reds → after 5 reds → finish with 9 reds.\n\nBut if I could get *some* reds from you, I’d save my reds. But you have zero reds.\n\nSo I cannot receive red from you.\n\nBut perhaps we can swap **for tiles we both pass**?\n\nWait — do we even share any tile in the middle?\n\nLet me check:\n\nMy path: (0,0) - (1,0) - (1,1) - (2,1) - (2,2) - (3,2) - (3,3)  \nYou: (0,0) - (0,1) - (0,2) - (0,3) - (1,3) - (2,3) - (3,3)\n\nOnly shared tile: (0,0) and (3,3)\n\nAt (3,3) — we both end.\n\nBut (3,3) is green, and I have two greens, so no need to trade there.\n\n(0,0) is start — no cost to move into it.\n\nSo we have no intermediate shared tiles.\n\nThat means there’s no point where we exchange chips unless we both pass through same tiles.\n\nTherefore, **no direct chip exchange is needed** — because we don’t share any tile where we both require payment.\n\nBut let’s reexamine.\n\nIs there a way to coordinate movement so that we can trade at (3,3)? No, because (3,3) is goal — paid when arriving.\n\nBut the rule says: \"each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour\"\n\nSo we must"

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, we may be able to help each other by exchanging chips at specific tiles.\n\nLet’s examine critical points:\n- (1,0): R → I need a red chip\n- (1,1): R → another red\n- (2,1): R → third red\n- (2,2): R → fourth red\n- (3,2): R → fifth red\n- (3,3): G → one green (but already available in my bag)\n\nWait — I have 2 green chips, so I don’t need to trade for green.\n\nBUT — all the reds are on my path where I currently have to use my own reds.\n\nHowever, if I do not trade, I will spend 5 red chips → end with 9 red, plus 2 green → score = 20 + 5×(9+2) = 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nBut what if I could avoid spending red chips entirely?\n\nAlternatively — consider your path:  \nYou're at (0,0), goal is (3,3). Your best path might go through blues or greens.\n\nYour path using your strong color (blue):  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nRequires: 5 blue chips, 1 green.\n\nYou have 14 blue, 2 green → can cover this easily.\n\nBut note: (0,3) is B, (1,3) is B, (2,3) is B, (3,3) is G — so 5 blue, plus 1 green at end (which you have).\n\nSo your path costs: B:5, G:1 → you can do it alone.\n\nNow here’s where cooperation helps:\n\nIf I go via (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), that’s 5 reds (at (1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2)) and 1 green (at (3,3)).\n\nBut I already have 2 green, so green isn’t a problem.\n\nBut I only have 14 reds → after 5 reds → finish with 9 reds.\n\nBut if I could get *some* reds from you, I’d save my reds. But you have zero reds.\n\nSo I cannot receive red from you.\n\nBut perhaps we can swap **for tiles we both pass**?\n\nWait — do we even share any tile in the middle?\n\nLet me check:\n\nMy path: (0,0) - (1,0) - (1,1) - (2,1) - (2,2) - (3,2) - (3,3)  \nYou: (0,0) - (0,1) - (0,2) - (0,3) - (1,3) - (2,3) - (3,3)\n\nOnly shared tile: (0,0) and (3,3)\n\nAt (3,3) — we both end.\n\nBut (3,3) is green, and I have two greens, so no need to trade there.\n\n(0,0) is start — no cost to move into it.\n\nSo we have no intermediate shared tiles.\n\nThat means there’s no point where we exchange chips unless we both pass through same tiles.\n\nTherefore, **no direct chip exchange is needed** — because we don’t share any tile where we both require payment.\n\nBut let’s reexamine.\n\nIs there a way to coordinate movement so that we can trade at (3,3)? No, because (3,3) is goal — paid when arriving.\n\nBut the rule says: \"each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour\"\n\nSo we must"

This is a viable route with low chip cost.\n\n- Path 2 → (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3): this path requires 5 blue chips and 1 green chip. I have 0 blue chips, so I cannot make this move without trading first. Since I already have a fully feasible path that uses only my available chips, there is no need to trade now. Even if the other player has many blue chips ({'B': 14}), I don’t need to trade because I can complete my goal via Path 1 without any risk or dependency on cooperation. Moreover, the first step to (1,0) is safe and profitable — I’m using up only red chips, which I have plenty of, and I gain progress toward my goal. This move aligns perfectly with my selfish objective: maximize my score by finishing as efficiently as possible, with maximized remaining chip count. No trade is needed, and no delay is acceptable. Thus, I should proceed immediately.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
