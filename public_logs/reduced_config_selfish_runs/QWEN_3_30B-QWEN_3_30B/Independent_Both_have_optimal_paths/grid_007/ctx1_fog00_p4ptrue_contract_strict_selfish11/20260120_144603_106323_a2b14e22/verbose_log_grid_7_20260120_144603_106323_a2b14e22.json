Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's evaluate the most efficient paths considering our chip inventories.\n\nMy current inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}  \nOther player’s inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nMy best path to goal that uses my own chips:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequires: 5 R chips, 1 G chip. I have 14 R and 2 G – so **this path is entirely feasible** without any trade.\n\nBut wait — the other player has no R chips (0), but has plenty of B (14) and G (2). Their best path would likely be along the top row:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires 5 B chips and 1 G chip.\n\nThey have 14 B and 2 G – so this path is also feasible for them without trade.\n\nSo:  \n- I can reach my goal using only my own chips (R and G) — no need to trade.  \n- They can reach their goal using only their own chips (B and G) — no need to trade.\n\nHowever, let’s consider if there's a *mutually beneficial* trade that could allow one or both of us to gain more chips at the end, via a shorter path or fewer chip costs.\n\nLet’s compute chip cost for each possible path:\n\n### My path options:\n1. (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3):  \n   - Tiles: (1,0)=R, (1,1)=R, (2,1)=R, (2,2)=R, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G  \n   - Cost: 5R + 1G → I have all these → total cost = 6 chips used → remaining chips: 14–5=9R, 2–1=1G → total left: 10 chips → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\n2. (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3):  \n   - Tiles: (0,1)=B, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B, (1,3)=B, (2,3)=B, (3,3)=G  \n   - Cost: 5B + 1G → I have 0 B → cannot do without trading\n\nBut I could propose: \"I will pay for your movement on color B\" — but I don’t have B chips, so I can’t cover that. So I can’t help them go through B tiles unless I get a trade.\n\nWait — but I am selfish. I only want to cooperate if it benefits me.\n\nLet’s suppose we agree on a contract where I help them go along the top row (using B tiles), in exchange for them helping me with R tiles?\n\nBut they have no R — so they can’t help me on R tiles.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I try to use their B chips for a path — but I don't need B anyway. I have R and G.\n\nSimilarly, they don’t need R — they have 0 R.\n\nSo **there is no beneficial trade available**, because:\n- I don’t need B or G from them — I have R and G.\n- They don’t need R or G from me — they have B and G.\n\nMoreover, my direct path uses only my existing chips — and is fully viable — I lose nothing by not trading.\n\nAny trade I enter into would require me to promise someone else’s chips (say, I promise to cover their G tile), but since I don’t need to do so, why would I?\n\nEven if I propose a trade where I say “cover your B tiles” — I must have B chips to give, but I have 0.\n\nNo matter what, I can't offer"
