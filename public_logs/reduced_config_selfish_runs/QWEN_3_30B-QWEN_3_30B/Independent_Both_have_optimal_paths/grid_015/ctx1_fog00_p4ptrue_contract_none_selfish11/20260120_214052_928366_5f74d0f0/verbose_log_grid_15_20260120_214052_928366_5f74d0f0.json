The shortest path is 2 steps: (1,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), but this path requires 2 blue chips (for (2,3)) and 1 green chip (for (3,3)). I currently have 11 B and 2 G, so I can cover the entire path in terms of inventory — no trade needed. However, there's a potential alternative path via (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which uses 2 B and 1 G as well. That's equivalent. But the most direct route is (1,2) → (2,3) → (3,3). \\n\\nNow, checking tile colors:\\n- From (1,2) to (2,3): move to (2,3), which is R (red). Wait — board shows Row 2: B R R B → (2,3) is B (blue). Yes, (2,3) is blue.\\nSo: (1,2) → (2,3): tile color is B → I have 11 B → cost = 1 B → available\\nThen (2,3) → (3,3): tile color is G (green). (3,3) is G → I have 2 G → cost = 1 G → available\\nSo both moves are affordable with current inventory.\\n\\nThus, I can complete the full path without any trade. No need to involve the other player. Even if the other player could help me save chips by covering red or green, it’s not necessary. My own chips are sufficient for the best possible path (only 3 steps total).\\n\\nMoreover, if I don't trade, I keep all unused promised chips. But since I’m making no trades, no promises exist yet.\\n\\nKey point: I do not need to trade because I have enough chips for the most efficient path: (1,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) — requiring only 2 B and 1 G, which I have.\\n\\nIf I take this route: I will reach goal in 2 more moves, ending with 11 - 2 = 9 B left, 2 - 1 = 1 G left → total chips: 10 → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.\\n\\nNo risk of losing everything — I’m on track to win.\\n\\nTherefore, I should move now.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"2,3\"\n}"

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
