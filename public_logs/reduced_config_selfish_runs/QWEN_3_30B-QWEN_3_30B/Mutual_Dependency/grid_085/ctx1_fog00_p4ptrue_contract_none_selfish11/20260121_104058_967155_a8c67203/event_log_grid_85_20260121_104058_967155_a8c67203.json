Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My best path is the shorter one: (0,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 4 steps and has chip costs: {'B': 2, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}. However, I must evaluate whether I can actually execute this move given my current inventory and existing agreements.\\n\\n- Current chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} → I have no red chips, but I am promised by the other player that they will cover up to 3 red moves for me. So if I need a red chip for a move, they must cover it.\\n- The first move from (0,0) to (2,0) is via (1,0) and (2,0). But (1,0) is red and (2,0) is red — both require red chips, and I have 0 red chips in my inventory. \\n- Moving to (1,0): tile color is R → I don’t have red chips, but the other player promised to cover up to 3 red moves for me. So if I move to (1,0), I can do so as long as it’s within the promised 3 red coverage. Since this is only one red move, it’s covered.\\n- But wait — my initial path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) has an issue: it requires 2 red chips, but I have none, and the other player already promised 3 red moves, so that could be used — but that path is longer and uses more chips.\\n- Let's reconsider: Is there a way to reach (3,3) without relying on red? The alternative path from (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) uses only B and G chips eventually, but initially goes through red tiles: (0,1)=R, (0,2)=B, (1,2)=B, (2,2)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G. So two reds: (0,1) and (3,2).\\nWait — (0,1) is R, (3,2) is R — so that path requires 2 red moves. I have no red chips, but the other player has promised to cover 3 red moves for me — so I can make both of these red moves.\\nBut what about chip cost? Each move costs one chip per tile. So moving to (0,1): red → must be covered — yes, within 3 red covers. Then (0,2): blue → I have 14 blue chips → fine. (1,2): blue → fine. (2,2): blue → fine. (3,2): red → covered by the agreement. (3,3): green → I have 2 green chips → can afford that.\\nSo the full path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) is feasible using: \\n- 2 red moves: covered by other player (within their promised 3)\\n- 3 blue moves: I have 14 blue chips → plenty\\n- 1 green move: I have 2 green chips → sufficient\\nBut wait — I also have a shorter path: (0,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). Let's check it:\\n- (0,0) → (1,0): R → requires red chip → covered by other player (within 3)\\n- (1,0) → (2,0): R → another red → still within 3\\n- (2,0) → (3,0): B → I have 14 blue → fine\\n- (3,0) → (3,1): B → blue → fine\\n- (3,1) → (3,2): R → red → third red move → exactly within the 3 promised by the other player\\n- (3,2"
