Therefore, the 6-step path, although longer, allows me to proceed without needing any trade — a safer choice.\n\nSince I can move safely along the 6-step path without trading, and I gain an advantage by avoiding risky trades (especially since other player has 12 red chips, and I might be exploited unless I get better than fair value for my own chips), I should avoid trading and take the safe path.\n\nSo my next best move is to go from (0, 0) to (1, 0), which is valid, and I’ll then proceed down column 0 (which has B, B, B on (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)). All are blue — I have plenty. From there, I can move right to (3,1): R → I have 2 red chips; (3,2): B → I have 12; (3,3): G → I have 2.\n\nThus, this entire path is fully covered with current inventory.\n\nTherefore, I should move to (1, 0) now — it's on my safe path and takes me directly toward the goal with no risk or dependency on trade.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
