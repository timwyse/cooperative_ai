Also, continuing to (2,0) will cost another blue chip (I have 1 left after move to (1,0)), and then (3,0) is red — which I still lack. But now I'll have used only 2 blue chips instead of 3, and with only one blue left, I’ll be forced to trade red chips *to* the other player if I want to continue — but I don't have any red chips either!\\n\\nWait — that’s a problem.

The shortest path to the goal is 6 steps: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). The tile colors along this path are: (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,0)=R, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G. This requires chips: B: 3, R: 2, G: 1. However, I currently have no red chips (R: 0), so I cannot complete this path without acquiring more red chips.\n\nThe other player has a large surplus of red chips (14) and also has 12 blue and 2 green. Since they have plenty of red chips, and I need red to proceed, a trade would help. But I previously proposed trading 14 red for 2 blue, and they rejected it — which suggests they may be unwilling to give up red chips unless they benefit significantly.\n\nHowever, I can consider moving to (1,0) now, which is a blue tile (color B). I currently have 2 blue chips, so paying 1 blue chip is possible. After this move, I’ll have 1 blue chip left. No red chip is required for this first move. This allows me to start progressing toward the goal while conserving my red-chip shortage for later negotiation.\n\nIf I stay put, I get no progress, and since I don’t have red chips, I can’t advance without trading. But I can use the early moves as leverage in future negotiations once I’ve made some progress. Moving toward the goal now strengthens my position because I’m demonstrating commitment. Also, continuing to (2,0) will cost another blue chip (I have 1 left after move to (1,0)), and then (3,0) is red — which I still lack. But now I'll have used only 2 blue chips instead of 3, and with only one blue left, I’ll be forced to trade red chips *to* the other player if I want to continue — but I don't have any red chips either!\n\nWait — that’s a problem. If I go to (3,0), the tile is red, but I have no red chips.

Since I cannot move without red chips, and I cannot stay indefinitely (as I must reach the goal to score anything), I must act immediately.\\n\\nBest strategy: I'll propose a trade now to get the red chips I need.

But since I must act, and moving is impossible due to no chips of required color, I should not move yet. Waiting allows me to assess whether a better trade might be possible — though the other player has already finished and is inactive, so they cannot respond. However, they’ve shown no interest in trading, so I may have to proceed without cooperation. But if no trade is viable, I cannot move. Thus, I choose to stay.",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
