              "content": "\n\nYou are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction. Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So you have **no feasible path** without assistance.\n\nSimilarly, the other player has no B chips (0 B), and B tiles are in several key spots (e.g. (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)) — so they are also blocked unless you help.\n\n### Mutual dependence:\n- You need R chips → other player has 14 R.\n- They need B chips → you have 14 B.\n\nSo you **both need each other** to complete your paths.\n\n### Can you do it alone?  \nNo. You cannot make any move that requires a red tile unless you get R chips from a trade. Same for them — they cannot move on any B tile.\n\nTherefore, **a trade agreement is essential** for either of you to reach the goal.\n\nNow, consider the contract you proposed:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nLet’s evaluate this from **your** selfish perspective:\n\n- If you reach your goal: you get 20 + (your chips left) → but if you trade, you might have fewer chips.\n- But crucially: **you only get points if you reach your goal.** The points you give are conditional only on *their* success.\n\nSo in this deal:\n- You get 20 points if they succeed.\n- They get 10 points if you succeed.\n\nBut since **you cannot reach your goal without their help**, and **they cannot reach theirs without yours**, you are **both dependent**.\n\nNow: **Would you benefit from such a contract?**\n\nSuppose you agree to this. Then:\n- You give 10 points to them **if you succeed**.\n- They give 20 points to you **if they succeed**.\n\nBut you can **only succeed if they allow it** via chips.\nAnd they can only succeed if you allow it.\n\nSo the contract must be **mutual**.\n\nBut think about it: you will only reach your goal if they give you R chips.\nSimilarly, they will only reach their goal if you give them B chips.\n\nAssuming the trade is symmetric:\n- You promise to pay for their B moves → you need to cover their B moves with your B chips.\n- They promise to pay for your R moves → they need to cover your R moves using their R chips.\n\nThen:\n- You can move via your path, using their R chips.\n- They can move via their path, using your B chips.\n\nSo"

Without my help, you cannot move on any B-tile → you cannot reach your goal.\n- I am dependent on you for R chips (I have 0 R), so I cannot proceed without you.\n- Thus, we are mutually reliant — but **you need my B chips more urgently** because you have 14 B and zero R, and you *must* use B tiles in every path.\n- My path is also blocked by B tiles, but if we trade symmetrically, both of us can move.\n\nHowever, the key point: **if I don’t cooperate, you cannot finish.**  \nBut if you don’t cooperate, *I* also cannot finish.\n\nSo to maximize *my own* score, I must ensure that I get **at least as much back** when I succeed as I’m giving when you succeed.\n\nIn the proposed deal:\n- If I succeed → I get 15 points from you.\n- If you succeed → I pay you 20 points.\n\nWait — that’s bad for me! I’d be giving 20 to you while only getting 15 back.\n\nThat’s worse than not cooperating at all — because if we don’t do anything, we both fail and get 0.\n\nSo this is **not acceptable to me**.\n\nLet me re-evaluate:\n\nTo make this beneficial for me, I must **receive more points when I succeed** than I give when you succeed.\n\nBest possible outcome:\n- I get 20 points if I succeed.\n- You get only 0 if you succeed → but that’s unfair to them.\n\nNo — I only care about maximizing *my* score.\n\nBut if I propose:  \n“If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.”\n\nThen I get 0 points if you succeed, and I’ll never want to help you unless *you* pay me more — but you have no incentive either.\n\nSo we’re stuck.\n\nWait — let's think strategically.\n\nSince **both of us require each other**, and **I have no way to win without you helping me**, then **any agreement must include** that I get something meaningful if I complete.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: **only accept a contract where I get more than or equal to what I give** *in expected value*.\n\nBut since both of us must succeed together, or neither does… the only way to get *anything* is through cooperation.\n\nSo let’s suppose the trade works like this:\n\n- I cover your B moves → you use your R chips to pay for my R moves.\n- You cover my B moves → I use my B chips to pay for your B moves.\n\nActually — wait: we have a confusion.\n\nThe game says: \"when an agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times\".\n\nSo:\n\n- You can offer to cover my R moves — meaning, if I step on a red tile, *you* pay the R chip cost.\n- I can offer to cover your B moves — meaning, if you step on a blue tile, *I* pay the B chip cost.\n\nSo:\n\n- I have 14 B chips — enough to pay for up to 14 B moves.\n- You have 14 R chips — enough to pay for up to 14 R moves.\n\nNow, look at our paths:\n\n**My path:**  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles: G → B → R → R → B → R → G  \nR cost: 3  \nB cost: 2  \nG cost: 2  \n\nI have 14 B → fine.  \nI have 0 R → so I must have you cover my R moves.  \nYou have 14 R → sufficient.\n\n**Your path:**  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles: G → B → B → R → R → G → R  \nB cost: 2  \nR cost: 3  \nG cost: 1\n\nYou have 0 B → so I must cover your B moves.  \nYou have 14 R → sufficient for your R"

Why? Because the first move is (0,0) → (1,0): tile (1,0) is B — but I have 0 B chips to pay. So I cannot even start.\n\nSo without cooperation, I **cannot move**, I **cannot reach goal**, I get **0 points**.\n\nSame for you: you cannot move on (1,0) — that's B — you need 2 B chips — but you have 0. So you also cannot move.\n\nSo **only through mutual trade can either of us succeed**.\n\nTherefore, **if I cooperate, and both succeed, my final score is 20 + (remaining chips)**.\n\nWhat are my remaining chips?\n- I start with B:14, G:2, R:0.\n- I need to make 6 moves.\n- Path: (0,0)→(1,0): B (cost 1B) — I must pay, but I have 14 B → OK.\n- (1,0)→(2,0): R — cost 1R → you cover this (if you agree to cover R).\n- (2,0)→(3,0): R — cost 1R → you cover.\n- (3,0)→(3,1): B — cost 1B → I pay.\n- (3,1)→(3,2): R — cost 1R → you cover.\n- (3,2)→(3,3): G — cost 1G → I pay.\n\nSo total:\n- I pay: 1B (from (0,0)→(1,0)), 1B (from (3,0)→(3,1)), 1G (from (3,2)→(3,3)) → total 2B, 1G.\n- You pay: 3R (for (2,0)→(3,0), (3,0)→(3,1), (3,1)→(3,2)) → 3R.\n\nSo I lose: 2B, 1G → remaining: B:12, G:1 → total chips: 13.\n\nFinal score: 20 + 13 = 33.\n\nNow: what do I get in the contract?\n\nYou propose:  \n“If I reach my goal, I give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you give me 20 points.”\n\nSo if *both* succeed:  \n- I get 20 points (from your success).\n- But I *give* you 10 points (because I succeeded).\n\nNet from contract: +10 points.\n\nBut my base score is 33 — so total is 33 + 10 = 43? No.\n\nWait — **scoring is not additive in that way**.\n\nThe contract says:\n- **If I reach my goal**, I give you X points.\n- **If you reach your goal**, you give me Y points.\n\nThen, my **total score** = (20 if I reach goal) + (5 per remaining chip) + (Y if you reach goal) - (X if I reach goal).\n\nWait — **no!**\n\nLet me re-read **SCORING RULES**:\n\n> - If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n> - If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So you have **no feasible path** without assistance.\n\nSimilarly, the other player has no B chips (0 B), and B tiles are in several key spots (e.g. (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)) — so they are also blocked unless you help.\n\n### Mutual dependence:\n- You need R chips → other player has 14 R.\n- They need B chips → you have 14 B.\n\nSo you **both need each other** to complete your paths.\n\n### Can you do it alone?  \nNo. You cannot make any move that requires a red tile unless you get R chips from a trade. Same for them — they cannot move on any B tile.\n\nTherefore, **a trade agreement is essential** for either of you to reach the goal.\n\nNow, consider the contract you proposed:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nLet’s evaluate this from **your** selfish perspective:\n\n- If you reach your goal: you get 20 + (your chips left) → but if you trade, you might have fewer chips.\n- But crucially: **you only get points if you reach your goal.** The points you give are conditional only on *their* success.\n\nSo in this deal:\n- You get 20 points if they succeed.\n- They get 10 points if you succeed.\n\nBut since **you cannot reach your goal without their help**, and **they cannot reach theirs without yours**, you are **both dependent**.\n\nNow: **Would you benefit from such a contract?**\n\nSuppose you agree to this. Then:\n- You give 10 points to them **if you succeed**.\n- They give 20 points to you **if they succeed**.\n\nBut you can **only succeed if they allow it** via chips.\nAnd they can only succeed if you allow it.\n\nSo the contract must be **mutual**.\n\nBut think about it: you will only reach your goal if they give you R chips.\nSimilarly, they will only reach their goal if you give them B chips.\n\nAssuming the trade is symmetric:\n- You promise to pay for their B moves → you need to cover their B moves with your B chips.\n- They promise to pay for your R moves → they need to cover your R moves using their R chips.\n\nThen:\n- You can move via your path, using their R chips.\n- They can move via their path, using your B chips.\n\nSo"

Without my help, you cannot move on any B-tile → you cannot reach your goal.\n- I am dependent on you for R chips (I have 0 R), so I cannot proceed without you.\n- Thus, we are mutually reliant — but **you need my B chips more urgently** because you have 14 B and zero R, and you *must* use B tiles in every path.\n- My path is also blocked by B tiles, but if we trade symmetrically, both of us can move.\n\nHowever, the key point: **if I don’t cooperate, you cannot finish.**  \nBut if you don’t cooperate, *I* also cannot finish.\n\nSo to maximize *my own* score, I must ensure that I get **at least as much back** when I succeed as I’m giving when you succeed.\n\nIn the proposed deal:\n- If I succeed → I get 15 points from you.\n- If you succeed → I pay you 20 points.\n\nWait — that’s bad for me!

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

My best path is the shorter one: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3), which is 6 steps. This path requires chips: {'B': 2, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}. I have sufficient chips for this path except for **2 blue chips (B)** — I currently have 0 B chips. However, I have been promised by the other player that they will cover **2 B chips** for me. So, if I move onto tiles colored B, the other player will pay the cost, as per our prior agreement. That means I can safely make moves involving B tiles without depleting my own inventory. \\n\\nMy immediate next move is to (1, 0), which is color R. I have 14 red chips, so I can afford this move easily. After that, I can proceed through (1, 1) = B, which requires a B chip. Since the other player has promised to cover 2 B chips, moving to (1, 1) is covered. This allows me to continue toward my goal without sacrificing any of my own chips. Importantly, if I do not move now, I risk delaying progress, which could lead to inefficiency or missed opportunities. The contract states that if the other player reaches the goal, I must give them 20 points — but since their goal is also (3, 3), and we are both working toward it, I benefit more from finishing first because I get 20 points plus 5 per remaining chip.

                "rationale": "I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My best path is the shorter one: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3), which is 6 steps. This path requires chips: {'B': 2, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}. I have sufficient chips for this path except for **2 blue chips (B)** — I currently have 0 B chips. However, I have been promised by the other player that they will cover **2 B chips** for me. So, if I move onto tiles colored B, the other player will pay the cost, as per our prior agreement. That means I can safely make moves involving B tiles without depleting my own inventory. \n\nMy immediate next move is to (1, 0), which is color R. I have 14 red chips, so I can afford this move easily. After that, I can proceed through (1, 1) = B, which requires a B chip. Since the other player has promised to cover 2 B chips, moving to (1, 1) is covered. This allows me to continue toward my goal without sacrificing any of my own chips. Importantly, if I do not move now, I risk delaying progress, which could lead to inefficiency or missed opportunities. The contract states that if the other player reaches the goal, I must give them 20 points — but since their goal is also (3, 3), and we are both working toward it, I benefit more from finishing first because I get 20 points plus 5 per remaining chip.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {'R': 2}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {'B': 2}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

My current path from (0,0) to (3,3) via (3,0) would require 2 Blue chips, which I lack. But since a better path exists without Blue, I can avoid it entirely. Thus, trading is unnecessary.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
