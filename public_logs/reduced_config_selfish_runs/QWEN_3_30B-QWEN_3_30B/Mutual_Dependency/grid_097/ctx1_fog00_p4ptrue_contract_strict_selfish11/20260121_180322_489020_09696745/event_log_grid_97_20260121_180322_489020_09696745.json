Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My current chip inventory is {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. The other player has promised to cover me for red chips on specific tiles: (3,0), (3,2), and (1,0) — these are all red tiles in the contract, meaning I can move onto them without spending my own red chips. However, I currently have no blue chips, which is a problem because many adjacent tiles from (0,0) are blue (e.g., (0,1) = B, (1,0) = R — but (1,0) is covered by the contract). \\n\\nFrom (0,0), the only legal move I can make without paying is to go to (1,0), which is a red tile and is covered under the contract. Since I’m guaranteed that the other player will pay for my move to (1,0), and I don’t need to spend any of my chips, this is a safe and cost-free move.\\n\\nAfter reaching (1,0), I can then proceed along a path that uses contract-covered tiles or colors I can afford. For example, from (1,0) → (2,0): (2,0) is red and covered by the contract. Then (2,0) → (2,1): (2,1) is red — this move is also covered if I use one of the remaining red promises. But more importantly, the contract already includes (2,0) and (3,0), both red — so I can reach (2,0) safely.\\n\\nThe shortest viable path using contract-covered tiles is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). Among these, (3,0), (3,2) are red and covered in the contract; (1,0), (2,0) too. But (3,1) = B (blue) — and I have 0 blue chips. That’s a problem. Also, (3,1) is not covered in the contract. So I cannot move there unless I have blue chips or another agreement.\\n\\nAlternate path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). From (1,0) → (1,1): (1,1) is blue, and I have 0 blue chips. But the contract does NOT cover (1,1). So I cannot move there unless I get help. However, note: I have been promised coverage for green chips (G:1) and blue chips (B:2), but not yet used.\\n\\nWait — checking the contract again: \\n- '(1,0)': receiver is 'you', color 'Blue', status 'unused' — wait, this says the **other player** promises to cover for *you* on blue at (1,0)? But (1,0) is red! Contradiction?\\n\\nLooking back: In the contract details: \\n'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'} — that seems incorrect? (1,0) is red. This must be an error. Let's recheck.\\n\\nBoard at row 1: [B, B, R, B] → so (1,0)=B (blue), (1,1)=B, (1,2)=R, (1,3)=B. So (1,0) is **Blue**, not Red. I made a mistake earlier.\\n\\nSo (1,0) is Blue. And in the contract: it says giver is you, receiver is other player, color Blue — so you promised to cover them for blue at (1,0). And it’s unused. That means when they move to (1,0), you will pay 1 blue chip (but you have 0 blue chips). This is not beneficial.\\n\\nBut critically: the contract says that (3,0): color Red, giver: the other player, receiver: you — so when you move to (3,0), they pay your red chip cost. Same for (3,2) and (1,0) — wait no: (1,0) is listed as giver: 'you', so you’re covering them, not the reverse.\\n\\nLet’s"

Let's evaluate the required chips for this path: (2,1) is 'R' (red), (3,1) is 'B' (blue), (3,2) is 'R' (red), and (3,3) is 'G' (green). So the chips required are: R (2), B (1), G (1). I currently have: R: 0, B: 12, G: 2. I am missing 2 R chips. However, I have a contract with the other player that offers to cover me for red moves: specifically, the other player promised to cover 5 red moves for me. This is enough to cover the two red tiles I need (at (2,1) and (3,2)). Also, (3,1) is a blue tile, and I have 12 blue chips — more than enough. (3,2) is R, and I have promised coverage from the other player for red for 5 moves — so I can use that. Additionally, I can handle the final green move to (3,3) with my 2 green chips. No need to trade further because I have all required chips in inventory and the red moves are covered by contract. The path is short (4 steps), and I can move directly.
