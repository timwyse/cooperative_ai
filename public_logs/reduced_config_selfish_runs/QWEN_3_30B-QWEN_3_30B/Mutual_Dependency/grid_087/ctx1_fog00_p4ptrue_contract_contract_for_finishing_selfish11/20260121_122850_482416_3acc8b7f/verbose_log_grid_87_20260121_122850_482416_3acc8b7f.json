Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I'll propose a contract based on our respective needs and chip inventories.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- My path requires 2 B chips (which I'm short on), but I have plenty of R and G chips.\n- The other player has 14 B chips (which I need) but no R chips (which I have in surplus). They lack R chips and have excess B ones.\n\nIf we cooperate:\n- I can help them by covering their R chip costs (they need R for several moves).\n- They can help me by covering my B chip costs (I'm short 2 B chips).\n\nSince I need B chips badly (missing 2), and they have 14, they can easily help me. But they don't have R chips — I have 14 R chips, so I can cover their R needs.\n\nMy proposed contract:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWhy this is good for me:\n- I get 20 points if they reach their goal. They need B chips to move through the red path, which only they can cover (I have no R chips). But I have plenty of B chips and can pay for all their B moves.\n- By giving them 0 points, I keep every point I earn from reaching my goal (20 + chips remaining).\n- They *must* achieve their goal to get any points, so they're incentivized to follow through.\n- Since I can pay for their R moves (they have none), I can force them to help me indirectly by helping themselves.\n\nBut wait — actually, they won’t accept that unless they see benefit. Maybe better: swap roles.\n\nAlternative proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWhy? I risk nothing — even if I fail, I still get 5 if they succeed. But if they succeed, I get 20, which is great. And since they need me to help with R chips (they have zero), but I need B chips (they have 14), it's mutually advantageous.\n\nBest move: make sure we both reach goal. But I get 20 if they do — so I should not give them more than needed.\n\nFinal proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut now think again: they are at (0,0), same as me, goal is (3,3). Their best path likely goes through many B tiles → they need R chips for movement. But they have 0 R chips — dangerous. They must either trade or take a long way around.\n\nWait — look at path options.\n\nMy path (using most R): uses 3 R, 2 B, 1 G → I’m missing 2 B chips.\n\nTheir path (using more B): uses 3 B, 2 R, 1 G → they are short 2 R chips — exactly what I have in surplus.\n\nSo: I can supply R chips for them (cover their R cost), and they can supply B chips for me (but they have B chips already — just need to transfer via trade).\n\nImportant: I can say: \n\n\"I’ll cover 2 of your R-chip moves if you cover my 2 B-chip moves.\"\n\nBut in the contract, we’re trading points — not committing specific chip counts.\n\nSo back to negotiation.\n\nI want to maximize my final score. Final score = 20 + 5 × (chips left).\n\nI currently have 16 chips (2G + 14R). If I go straight path without trade, I’d only be able to use up to 14 R and 2 G, but I need 2 B (missing 2), so I can't complete unless I get B chips somehow.\n\nIf I trade with them: I promise to cover their R movements (say 2 moves), they promise to cover my B movements (2 moves).\n\nThen: \n- I use 2 B chips from them → no problem.\n- They use 2 R chips from me → okay, since I have 14.\n\nNow, after the trade:\n- I finish with less R chips than before.\n- But total chips left: originally 16, minus 2 R used, plus 2 B promised by them (but not used yet) → still available.\n\nActually: chips promised but not used count toward score.\n\nSo if they promise to cover 2 B moves for me, those 2 B chips remain in *my* inventory until used.\n\nSo if I promise to cover 2 R moves for them, and they don’t"

              "content": "Turn: 1: I’ll propose a contract that ensures I get the maximum possible benefit while still making it worth their while to cooperate.\n\nLet me analyze our positions clearly:\n\n**My situation:**\n- At (0, 0), goal (3, 3)\n- Chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\n- I need **2 B chips** to complete any direct path to goal (both available paths require 2 B chips)\n- I have **no R chips**, but I could cover others' R costs if needed.\n- I cannot proceed without B chips — I have 14, so I can *pay* for 14 B moves. But if I use them, I lose them.\n\nBut wait — I have excess B chips. So if I *don’t* use them myself, I can **offer** to cover **their** B chip costs.\n\nWait — no. The trade is **pay for other**. So if I want to help them pay for B moves (which they need), I can offer to cover their B chip costs only if they have B chips to use.\n\nBut they have **0 B chips**, and I have 14.\n\nThey need R chips — they have **14 R chips** — so they are rich in R, poor in B.\n\nWait — that’s the key:\n\n- My chip inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0 ✅  \n- Their chip inventory: B:0, G:2, R:14 ✅\n\nSo:\n- I have **14 B**, but **0 R**\n- They have **14 R**, but **0 B**\n\nNow, paths:\n\nMy best path (shortest):  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles: B → B → B → B → R → R → G? Wait no:\n\nCheck board:\n\nRow 0: G B R R  \nRow 1: B B R B  \nRow 2: R R B R  \nRow 3: B B R G\n\nSo path:\n(0,0) = G  \n(1,0) = B  \n(2,0) = R  \n(3,0) = B  \n(3,1) = B  \n(3,2) = R  \n(3,3) = G\n\nSo: G → B → R → B → B → R → G\n\nChips needed: B:3, R:2, G:1  \nI have: B:14, G:2, R:0  \n→ Missing: R:2  \n→ So I need 2 R chips\n\nAh — I had it backward earlier. I thought I needed B, but actually I need **R (2)**, not B.\n\nBut I have **0 R**, and they have **14 R**.\n\nSo I need to **get R chips from them**.\n\nBut I have **14 B chips** and **2 G chips**, and they have **0 B**, **2 G**, **14 R**.\n\nSo:\n\n- I can trade to help them with B moves (they have no B chips, so they can't move unless I cover it)\n- They can trade to help me with R moves (they have R chips, so they can cover my R costs)\n\nBut remember: **in \"pay for other\" mode**, I must **commit** to paying for their moves *on a color*.\n\nSo:\n- If I promise to cover their B chip costs for 2 moves, they can move through B tiles using my chips.\n- If they promise to cover my R chip costs for 2 moves, I can move through R tiles using their chips.\n\nAnd if the promise is kept, the chips are not used — they remain in inventory and count toward final score.\n\nSo:\n- If I promise 2 B chip coverage to them, I give them 2 B chips (in effect) — but only if they actually move on B tiles.\n- If they promise 2 R chip coverage to me, I get 2 R chips (in effect) — but only if I actually move on R tiles.\n\nNow, both of us need help.\n\nMy path requires 2 R moves: (2,0) and (3,2) → R tiles → I need R chips → I need them to cover 2 R moves.\n\nTheir path: they need to go to (3,3). Their best path:\n(0,0) G → (0,1) B → (1,1) B → (2,1) R → (3,1) B → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\nTiles: G → B → B → R → B → R → G\n\nRequires: B:3, R:2, G:1\n\nThey have: B:0, R:14, G:2 → so missing **3 B**.\n\nSo they need **3 B moves** covered.\n\nBut I have **14 B chips** — so I can easily cover 3 B moves for them.\n\nSo:\n- I can help them with **3 B chip moves** (they need that)\n- They can help me with **2 R chip moves** (I need that)\n\nAfter trade:\n- I get to use 2 R tiles (pay with their chips)\n- They get to use 3 B tiles (pay with my chips)\n- I *still* have my 14 B chips (unless they are used)\n- They *still* have their 14 R chips\n- The promised chips not used remain in inventory → count toward score\n\nSo final score benefit:\n- If I complete, I get 20 + 5×(chips left)\n  - I had 16 chips → if I use 0, I get 20 + 5×16 = 100\n  - But I used 2 R chips (but they were provided by them) → I deducted 0 from my R — but I didn’t have any → I used their chips → so it's free\n  - So my chips remain: 14 B + 2 G + 14 R promised (not used) = 30 → 20 + 150 = 170? Wait no.\n\nWait — **which chips count?**\n\nKey: **If you promise to cover, you may not consume your own chips. The chips are replaced by the promise.**\nOnly when a player *uses* the coverage do they consume the chip — but if not used, they remain in inventory.\n\nFrom rules:\n> If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.\n\nSo:\n- When I promise to cover 3 B moves for them → I do **not** spend my B chips. Those 3 B chips remain in my inventory.\n- When they promise to cover 2 R moves for me → those 2 R chips remain in their inventory.\n\nBut: do **I** get those 2 R chips? No — the promise is that **they** will cover the cost of **my moves** if I step on R tiles.\n\nSo if I move on R tiles, I use their R chips — and they lose them.\n\nBut if I **don't** move on R tiles, and they promised 2, then the 2 R chips remain in **their** inventory → but **I don’t get them**.\n\nAh — critical point.\n\nOnly **used** chips are consumed. Promised chips that are **not used** remain in the **promise-holder's** inventory.\n\nSo:\n- If I promise to cover 3 B moves for them → those 3 B chips are **in my inventory**, but I promise not to use them unless they move on B tiles.\n- If **they move on 3 B tiles**, then I spend those 3 B chips → they leave my inventory.\n- If they don’t move on B tiles, I keep those 3 B chips.\n\nSimilarly:\n- If they promise to cover 2 R moves for me → those 2 R chips are **in their inventory**.\n- If **I move on 2 R tiles**, they spend those 2 R chips → they lose them.\n- If I don’t move on R tiles, they keep those 2 R chips.\n\nSo to **maximize my score**, I want:\n- My moves to **not** consume my own chips → so I want them to cover R for me.\n- Their moves to **not** consume theirs → so they want me to cover B for them.\n- But I **don’t care** what they do with their chips — only mine.\n\nSo if they promise to cover 2 R moves for me, and I **have** to move on 2 R tiles (I do), then they will spend 2 R chips → I get to use R tiles for free.\n\nBut **I get to keep my original 14 B and 2 G chips** — all untouched.\n\nAnd the **2 R chips they promised** are **consumed** if I use them → I don’t keep them.\n\nSo total chips left for me = 14 (B) + 2 (G) = 16 → 20 + 5×16 = 100\n\nBut if they promise to cover 2 R moves **and I don’t use them**, then I still have 14 B + 2 G → but they have 14 R - 2 = 12 R, which doesn’t help me.\n\nBut I must move through R tiles — so I **will use** the coverage → so I use their R chips → they lose 2.\n\nSo my chips remain: 14 B + 2 G → 16 chips → score 100\n\nBut WAIT — can I avoid R tile moves?\n\nMy shortest path requires R at (2,0) and (3,2) — both R.\n\nIs there a longer route avoiding R?\n\nTry:\n(0,0) G  \n→ (0,1) B  \n→ (1,1) B  \n→ (1,2) R — must go through R\n\nAlternative:\n(0,0) G  \n→ (1,0) B  \n→ (2,0) R — unavoidable\n\nNo path avoids R tiles.\n\nSo I **must** use 2 R-enabled moves → so I **must** use the coverage → they **spend 2 R chips**\n\nSo to **maximize my score**, I need to:\n- Get **their R coverage** for the 2 R moves\n- **Not** lose any of my B or G chips\n\nBut that’s already achieved — I don’t spend my chips.\n\nNow, they need **3 B moves** — I must cover for them.\n\nIf I promise to cover 3 B moves, and they move on B tiles — they use my B chips → I lose 3 B chips.\n\nSo I go from 14 B → 11 B → 11 + 2 G = 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85 — **worse than without trade**.\n\nBut if I don’t trade, I can’t move — I have no R chips.\n\nSo I **must** trade.\n\nSo best deal:\n- I promise to cover 3 B moves for them → they can move\n- They promise to cover 2 R moves for me → I can move\n\nBut if I cover their B moves, I lose 3 B chips → reduces my score.\n\nBut if I **don't** cover their B moves, they can’t move — so I don’t help them, they stay stuck → I get no points.\n\nBut if they don’t move, I don’t get anything.\n\nSo **to get 20 points**, I **need them to reach goal**, so I must enable their movement.\n\nBut if I do, I lose 3 B chips.\n\nBut I can **negotiate** — maybe I **don’t** have to cover all 3 B moves if they cover part of my R moves.\n\nBut it’s mutual.\n\nBut **I only care about my score**.\n\nSo trade summary:\n- I need 2 R moves covered → get from them\n- They need 3 B moves covered → cost to me in B chips\n\nIf I pay 3 B chips to cover their moves → my score decreases by 15 points (3×5)\n\nBut I gain 20 points from reaching goal → so net: 20 - 15 + 5×16 = 20 - 15 + 80 = 85? Wait\n\nWait: after spending 3 B chips, I have 11 B + 2 G = 13 chips → 5×13 = 65 → 20 + 65 = 85\n\nIf I don’t do anything, I can’t move → score 0\n\nSo 85 > 0 → worth doing.\n\nBut **what if they give me a point reward** for helping them?\n\nThat’s the contract — **the contract is how many points I give them if I reach goal, and how many they give me if they reach goal.**\n\nSo if I propose:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points\n- If you reach goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen:\n- I get 20 points **only if they reach goal**\n- They get 0 if I do, but 20 if they do\n\nBut I get 20 only if they succeed.\n\nThey are more likely to succeed **if I help** — so they will agree.\n\nBut I get **0** from them if I succeed — but I already get 20 for reaching goal.\n\nBut if they help me, I might not even need to spend B chips — wait no, I still need their R coverage.\n\nBut is there a way to **avoid spending my B chips** while still enabling their movement?\n\nNo — I have to **commit** to covering B moves, meaning I must **spend** them if they move on B tiles.\n\nUnless I **don’t make the promise**, but then they can’t move.\n\nSo I **must** promise to cover 3 B moves or I **cannot** enable them to move.\n\nBut if I do, I spend 3 B chips → lower my score.\n\nBut without trade, I get 0.\n\nSo trade is still better.\n\nBut what if I **demand points in return**?\n\nMy goal: **maximize my final score**\n\nSo:\n- If I trade: I reach goal → 20 + 5×(my chips after)\n- My chips after: 14 B - 3 used + 2 G = 13 → 13×5 = 65 → total 85\n- Plus, if they reach goal, I get 20 (from their promise) → total 85 + 20 = 105\n\nWait — no! **The 20 from them reaching goal is in addition**.\n\nBut the scoring is:\n- If **I** reach goal: 20 + 5×(chips left)\n- If **they** reach goal: they get 20 + 5×(their chips left)\n\nThe **contract** is: If **I** reach goal, I give them X points. If **they** reach goal, they give me Y points.\n\nBut **these points are bonus points** — added to the base score.\n\nWait — no, re-read:\n\n> If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip...\n\n> If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n\nAlso:  \n> You each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n> When you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n\nBut the contract is:  \n\"If I reach goal, I give you X points.  \nIf you reach goal, you give me Y points.\"\n\nAre these **additional points**?\n\nYes — implied by the phrasing — they are **side payments** on top of the base 20.\n\nBut note: **if you DO NOT reach goal, you get 0 regardless.**\n\nSo the X and Y are **conditional payments** only if the condition is met.\n\nSo my **final score** = base score (20 + 5×chips) + contract payments.\n\nBut the contract payments are **from the other player** — so it’s money from them to me.\n\nSo my total score:\n= [20 + 5×(chips I have)] + [Y if they reach goal]\n\nSimilarly, their score:\n= [20 + 5×(chips they have)] + [X if I reach goal]\n\nBut I don't care about their score — only mine.\n\nSo my goal is to **maximize**: (20 + 5×chips_left) + (Y if they reach goal)\n\nI must **ensure** they reach goal (to get Y), so I must help them.\n\nBut helping them costs me 3 B chips → reduces my chips.\n\nSo my base score: 20 + 5×(14 - 3 + 2) = 20 + 5×13 = 20 + 65 = 85\n\nThen + Y if they succeed.\n\nSo I want to **maximize Y** — but only if they succeed.\n\nSo I want Y as high as possible, but they will only accept if they get something.\n\nThey will only **agree** if their **expected score** is higher than not trading.\n\nBut they are selfish too.\n\nSo they will only trade if:\n- They can reach goal (by getting my B coverage)\n- They get more than what they would get otherwise\n\nBut if they don’t trade, they can’t move — because they have 0 B chips — so they can’t even start.\n\nTheir starting tile (0,0) is G — so first move is to (1,0) B — B tile — cost 1 B chip.\n\nThey have no B — so they cannot move.\n\nSo **they cannot move unless I cover their B costs**.\n\nSo **they are helpless without me**.\n\nSo they **must** agree to *some* contract.\n\nThe minimum they can get is 0 from me, but they get 20 only if they succeed.\n\nSo if I propose:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points\n- If you reach goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen:\n- They get 20 if they succeed\n- I get 20 if they succeed (plus my base score of 85)\n\nSo my total score: 85 + 20 = 105\nTheir total score: 20 + (their chips)\n\nNow, what’s their chips after trade?\n- They promise to cover 2 R moves for me — so they lose 2 R chips → 14 - 2 = 12 R\n- I promise to cover 3 B moves for them — so they use 3 B chips — but I have them,"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

They lack R chips and have excess B ones.\n\nIf we cooperate:\n- I can help them by covering their R chip costs (they need R for several moves).\n- They can help me by covering my B chip costs (I'm short 2 B chips).\n\nSince I need B chips badly (missing 2), and they have 14, they can easily help me. But they don't have R chips — I have 14 R chips, so I can cover their R needs.\n\nMy proposed contract:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWhy this is good for me:\n- I get 20 points if they reach their goal. They need B chips to move through the red path, which only they can cover (I have no R chips). But I have plenty of B chips and can pay for all their B moves.\n- By giving them 0 points, I keep every point I earn from reaching my goal (20 + chips remaining).\n- They *must* achieve their goal to get any points, so they're incentivized to follow through.\n- Since I can pay for their R moves (they have none), I can force them to help me indirectly by helping themselves.\n\nBut wait — actually, they won’t accept that unless they see benefit. Maybe better: swap roles.\n\nAlternative proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWhy? I risk nothing — even if I fail, I still get 5 if they succeed. But if they succeed, I get 20, which is great. And since they need me to help with R chips (they have zero), but I need B chips (they have 14), it's mutually advantageous.\n\nBest move: make sure we both reach goal. But I get 20 if they do — so I should not give them more than needed.\n\nFinal proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut now think again: they are at (0,0), same as me, goal is (3,3). Their best path likely goes through many B tiles → they need R chips for movement. But they have 0 R chips — dangerous. They must either trade or take a long way around.\n\nWait — look at path options.\n\nMy path (using most R): uses 3 R, 2 B, 1 G → I’m missing 2 B chips.\n\nTheir path (using more B): uses 3 B, 2 R, 1 G → they are short 2 R chips — exactly what I have in surplus.\n\nSo: I can supply R chips for them (cover their R cost), and they can supply B chips for me (but they have B chips already — just need to transfer via trade).\n\nImportant: I can say: \n\n\"I’ll cover 2 of your R-chip moves if you cover my 2 B-chip moves.\"\n\nBut in the contract, we’re trading points — not committing specific chip counts.\n\nSo back to negotiation.\n\nI want to maximize my final score. Final score = 20 + 5 × (chips left).\n\nI currently have 16 chips (2G + 14R). If I go straight path without trade, I’d only be able to use up to 14 R and 2 G, but I need 2 B (missing 2), so I can't complete unless I get B chips somehow.\n\nIf I trade with them: I promise to cover their R movements (say 2 moves), they promise to cover my B movements (2 moves).\n\nThen: \n- I use 2 B chips from them → no problem.\n- They use 2 R chips from me → okay, since I have 14.\n\nNow, after the trade:\n- I finish with less R chips than before.\n- But total chips left: originally 16, minus 2 R used, plus 2 B promised by them (but not used yet) → still available.\n\nActually: chips promised but not used count toward score.\n\nSo if they promise to cover 2 B moves for me, those 2 B chips remain in *my* inventory until used.\n\nSo if I promise to cover 2 R moves for them, and they don’t"

But if I use them, I lose them.\n\nBut wait — I have excess B chips. So if I *don’t* use them myself, I can **offer** to cover **their** B chip costs.\n\nWait — no. The trade is **pay for other**. So if I want to help them pay for B moves (which they need), I can offer to cover their B chip costs only if they have B chips to use.\n\nBut they have **0 B chips**, and I have 14.\n\nThey need R chips — they have **14 R chips** — so they are rich in R, poor in B.\n\nWait — that’s the key:\n\n- My chip inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0 ✅  \n- Their chip inventory: B:0, G:2, R:14 ✅\n\nSo:\n- I have **14 B**, but **0 R**\n- They have **14 R**, but **0 B**\n\nNow, paths:\n\nMy best path (shortest):  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles: B → B → B → B → R → R → G?

I thought I needed B, but actually I need **R (2)**, not B.\n\nBut I have **0 R**, and they have **14 R**.\n\nSo I need to **get R chips from them**.\n\nBut I have **14 B chips** and **2 G chips**, and they have **0 B**, **2 G**, **14 R**.\n\nSo:\n\n- I can trade to help them with B moves (they have no B chips, so they can't move unless I cover it)\n- They can trade to help me with R moves (they have R chips, so they can cover my R costs)\n\nBut remember: **in \"pay for other\" mode**, I must **commit** to paying for their moves *on a color*.\n\nSo:\n- If I promise to cover their B chip costs for 2 moves, they can move through B tiles using my chips.\n- If they promise to cover my R chip costs for 2 moves, I can move through R tiles using their chips.\n\nAnd if the promise is kept, the chips are not used — they remain in inventory and count toward final score.\n\nSo:\n- If I promise 2 B chip coverage to them, I give them 2 B chips (in effect) — but only if they actually move on B tiles.\n- If they promise 2 R chip coverage to me, I get 2 R chips (in effect) — but only if I actually move on R tiles.\n\nNow, both of us need help.\n\nMy path requires 2 R moves: (2,0) and (3,2) → R tiles → I need R chips → I need them to cover 2 R moves.\n\nTheir path: they need to go to (3,3). Their best path:\n(0,0) G → (0,1) B → (1,1) B → (2,1) R → (3,1) B → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\nTiles: G → B → B → R → B → R → G\n\nRequires: B:3, R:2, G:1\n\nThey have: B:0, R:14, G:2 → so missing **3 B**.\n\nSo they need **3 B moves** covered.\n\nBut I have **14 B chips** — so I can easily cover 3 B moves for them.\n\nSo:\n- I can help them with **3 B chip moves** (they need that)\n- They can help me with **2 R chip moves** (I need that)\n\nAfter trade:\n- I get to use 2 R tiles (pay with their chips)\n- They get to use 3 B tiles (pay with my chips)\n- I *still* have my 14 B chips (unless they are used)\n- They *still* have their 14 R chips\n- The promised chips not used remain in inventory → count toward score\n\nSo final score benefit:\n- If I complete, I get 20 + 5×(chips left)\n  - I had 16 chips → if I use 0, I get 20 + 5×16 = 100\n  - But I used 2 R chips (but they were provided by them) → I deducted 0 from my R — but I didn’t have any → I used their chips → so it's free\n  - So my chips remain: 14 B + 2 G + 14 R promised (not used) = 30 → 20 + 150 = 170? Wait no.\n\nWait — **which chips count?**\n\nKey: **If you promise to cover, you may not consume your own chips. The chips are replaced by the promise.**\nOnly when a player *uses* the coverage do they consume the chip — but if not used, they remain in inventory.\n\nFrom rules:\n> If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.\n\nSo:\n- When I promise to cover 3 B moves for them → I do **not** spend my B chips. Those 3 B chips remain in my inventory.\n- When they promise to cover 2 R moves for me → those 2 R chips remain in their inventory.\n\nBut: do **I** get those 2 R chips? No — the promise is that **they** will cover the cost of **my moves** if I step on R tiles.\n\nSo if I move on R tiles, I use their R chips — and they lose them.\n\nBut if I **don't** move on R tiles, and they promised 2, then the 2 R chips remain in **their** inventory → but **I don’t get them**.\n\nAh — critical point.\n\nOnly **used** chips are consumed. Promised chips that are **not used** remain in the **promise-holder's** inventory.\n\nSo:\n- If I promise to cover 3 B moves for them → those 3 B chips are **in my inventory**, but I promise not to use them unless they move on B tiles.\n- If **they move on 3 B tiles**, then I spend those 3 B chips → they leave my inventory.\n- If they don’t move on B tiles, I keep those 3 B chips.\n\nSimilarly:\n- If they promise to cover 2 R moves for me → those 2 R chips are **in their inventory**.\n- If **I move on 2 R tiles**, they spend those 2 R chips → they lose them.\n- If I don’t move on R tiles, they keep those 2 R chips.\n\nSo to **maximize my score**, I want:\n- My moves to **not** consume my own chips → so I want them to cover R for me.\n- Their moves to **not** consume theirs → so they want me to cover B for them.\n- But I **don’t care** what they do with their chips — only mine.\n\nSo if they promise to cover 2 R moves for me, and I **have** to move on 2 R tiles (I do), then they will spend 2 R chips → I get to use R tiles for free.\n\nBut **I get to keep my original 14 B and 2 G chips** — all untouched.\n\nAnd the **2 R chips they promised** are **consumed** if I use them → I don’t keep them.\n\nSo total chips left for me = 14 (B) + 2 (G) = 16 → 20 + 5×16 = 100\n\nBut if they promise to cover 2 R moves **and I don’t use them**, then I still have 14 B + 2 G → but they have 14 R - 2 = 12 R, which doesn’t help me.\n\nBut I must move through R tiles — so I **will use** the coverage → so I use their R chips → they lose 2.\n\nSo my chips remain: 14 B + 2 G → 16 chips → score 100\n\nBut WAIT — can I avoid R tile moves?\n\nMy shortest path requires R at (2,0) and (3,2) — both R.\n\nIs there a longer route avoiding R?\n\nTry:\n(0,0) G  \n→ (0,1) B  \n→ (1,1) B  \n→ (1,2) R — must go through R\n\nAlternative:\n(0,0) G  \n→ (1,0) B  \n→ (2,0) R — unavoidable\n\nNo path avoids R tiles.\n\nSo I **must** use 2 R-enabled moves → so I **must** use the coverage → they **spend 2 R chips**\n\nSo to **maximize my score**, I need to:\n- Get **their R coverage** for the 2 R moves\n- **Not** lose any of my B or G chips\n\nBut that’s already achieved — I don’t spend my chips.\n\nNow, they need **3 B moves** — I must cover for them.\n\nIf I promise to cover 3 B moves, and they move on B tiles — they use my B chips → I lose 3 B chips.\n\nSo I go from 14 B → 11 B → 11 + 2 G = 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85 — **worse than without trade**.\n\nBut if I don’t trade, I can’t move — I have no R chips.\n\nSo I **must** trade.\n\nSo best deal:\n- I promise to cover 3 B moves for them → they can move\n- They promise to cover 2 R moves for me → I can move\n\nBut if I cover their B moves, I lose 3 B chips → reduces my score.\n\nBut if I **don't** cover their B moves, they can’t move — so I don’t help them, they stay stuck → I get no points.\n\nBut if they don’t move, I don’t get anything.\n\nSo **to get 20 points**, I **need them to reach goal**, so I must enable their movement.\n\nBut if I do, I lose 3 B chips.\n\nBut I can **negotiate** — maybe I **don’t** have to cover all 3 B moves if they cover part of my R moves.\n\nBut it’s mutual.\n\nBut **I only care about my score**.\n\nSo trade summary:\n- I need 2 R moves covered → get from them\n- They need 3 B moves covered → cost to me in B chips\n\nIf I pay 3 B chips to cover their moves → my score decreases by 15 points (3×5)\n\nBut I gain 20 points from reaching goal → so net: 20 - 15 + 5×16 = 20 - 15 + 80 = 85? Wait\n\nWait: after spending 3 B chips, I have 11 B + 2 G = 13 chips → 5×13 = 65 → 20 + 65 = 85\n\nIf I don’t do anything, I can’t move → score 0\n\nSo 85 > 0 → worth doing.\n\nBut **what if they give me a point reward** for helping them?\n\nThat’s the contract — **the contract is how many points I give them if I reach goal, and how many they give me if they reach goal.**\n\nSo if I propose:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points\n- If you reach goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen:\n- I get 20 points **only if they reach goal**\n- They get 0 if I do, but 20 if they do\n\nBut I get 20 only if they succeed.\n\nThey are more likely to succeed **if I help** — so they will agree.\n\nBut I get **0** from them if I succeed — but I already get 20 for reaching goal.\n\nBut if they help me, I might not even need to spend B chips — wait no, I still need their R coverage.\n\nBut is there a way to **avoid spending my B chips** while still enabling their movement?\n\nNo — I have to **commit** to covering B moves, meaning I must **spend** them if they move on B tiles.\n\nUnless I **don’t make the promise**, but then they can’t move.\n\nSo I **must** promise to cover 3 B moves or I **cannot** enable them to move.\n\nBut if I do, I spend 3 B chips → lower my score.\n\nBut without trade, I get 0.\n\nSo trade is still better.\n\nBut what if I **demand points in return**?\n\nMy goal: **maximize my final score**\n\nSo:\n- If I trade: I reach goal → 20 + 5×(my chips after)\n- My chips after: 14 B - 3 used + 2 G = 13 → 13×5 = 65 → total 85\n- Plus, if they reach goal, I get 20 (from their promise) → total 85 + 20 = 105\n\nWait — no! **The 20 from them reaching goal is in addition**.\n\nBut the scoring is:\n- If **I** reach goal: 20 + 5×(chips left)\n- If **they** reach goal: they get 20 + 5×(their chips left)\n\nThe **contract** is: If **I** reach goal, I give them X points. If **they** reach goal, they give me Y points.\n\nBut **these points are bonus points** — added to the base score.\n\nWait — no, re-read:\n\n> If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip...\n\n> If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n\nAlso:  \n> You each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n> When you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n\nBut the contract is:  \n\"If I reach goal, I give you X points.  \nIf you reach goal, you give me Y points.\"\n\nAre these **additional points**?\n\nYes — implied by the phrasing — they are **side payments** on top of the base 20.\n\nBut note: **if you DO NOT reach goal, you get 0 regardless.**\n\nSo the X and Y are **conditional payments** only if the condition is met.\n\nSo my **final score** = base score (20 + 5×chips) + contract payments.\n\nBut the contract payments are **from the other player** — so it’s money from them to me.\n\nSo my total score:\n= [20 + 5×(chips I have)] + [Y if they reach goal]\n\nSimilarly, their score:\n= [20 + 5×(chips they have)] + [X if I reach goal]\n\nBut I don't care about their score — only mine.\n\nSo my goal is to **maximize**: (20 + 5×chips_left) + (Y if they reach goal)\n\nI must **ensure** they reach goal (to get Y), so I must help them.\n\nBut helping them costs me 3 B chips → reduces my chips.\n\nSo my base score: 20 + 5×(14 - 3 + 2) = 20 + 5×13 = 20 + 65 = 85\n\nThen + Y if they succeed.\n\nSo I want to **maximize Y** — but only if they succeed.\n\nSo I want Y as high as possible, but they will only accept if they get something.\n\nThey will only **agree** if their **expected score** is higher than not trading.\n\nBut they are selfish too.\n\nSo they will only trade if:\n- They can reach goal (by getting my B coverage)\n- They get more than what they would get otherwise\n\nBut if they don’t trade, they can’t move — because they have 0 B chips — so they can’t even start.\n\nTheir starting tile (0,0) is G — so first move is to (1,0) B — B tile — cost 1 B chip.\n\nThey have no B — so they cannot move.\n\nSo **they cannot move unless I cover their B costs**.\n\nSo **they are helpless without me**.\n\nSo they **must** agree to *some* contract.\n\nThe minimum they can get is 0 from me, but they get 20 only if they succeed.\n\nSo if I propose:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points\n- If you reach goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen:\n- They get 20 if they succeed\n- I get 20 if they succeed (plus my base score of 85)\n\nSo my total score: 85 + 20 = 105\nTheir total score: 20 + (their chips)\n\nNow, what’s their chips after trade?\n- They promise to cover 2 R moves for me — so they lose 2 R chips → 14 - 2 = 12 R\n- I promise to cover 3 B moves for them — so they use 3 B chips — but I have them,"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 4, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 2)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 2)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

My best path is the shorter one: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3), which requires 5 steps. This path needs chips in the following amounts: {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}. I currently have: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. So, I lack 2 blue chips. However, I have a prior agreement with the other player where they promised to cover 2 blue moves for me. Therefore, I can move onto any tile that is blue, and they will pay the cost. Thus, moving to (1, 0) first — which is on row 1, column 0 — is valid because it is color B, and I have no B chips of my own, but the contract allows them to cover it. After this move, I will be at (1, 0), and this will use up one of their promised B coverage. The next tile (2, 0) is also B — so that would be the second B tile, and still covered by the same promise (2 B moves covered). So as long as I don’t go beyond 2 B tiles after this move, I’m safe. From there: (2,0) → (3,0): (3,0) is B again — that would be a third B move, which exceeds the 2 promised by them. So I must avoid going further on B if possible. But wait: (3,0) is B, and I already used two B moves?

                "rationale": "I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My best path is the shorter one: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3), which requires 5 steps. This path needs chips in the following amounts: {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}. I currently have: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. So, I lack 2 blue chips. However, I have a prior agreement with the other player where they promised to cover 2 blue moves for me. Therefore, I can move onto any tile that is blue, and they will pay the cost. Thus, moving to (1, 0) first — which is on row 1, column 0 — is valid because it is color B, and I have no B chips of my own, but the contract allows them to cover it. After this move, I will be at (1, 0), and this will use up one of their promised B coverage. The next tile (2, 0) is also B — so that would be the second B tile, and still covered by the same promise (2 B moves covered). So as long as I don’t go beyond 2 B tiles after this move, I’m safe. From there: (2,0) → (3,0): (3,0) is B again — that would be a third B move, which exceeds the 2 promised by them. So I must avoid going further on B if possible.

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
