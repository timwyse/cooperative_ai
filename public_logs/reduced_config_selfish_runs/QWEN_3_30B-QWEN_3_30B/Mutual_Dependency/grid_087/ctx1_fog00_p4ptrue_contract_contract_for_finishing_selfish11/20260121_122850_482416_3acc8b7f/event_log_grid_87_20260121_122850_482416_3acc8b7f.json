Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My current chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The other player has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14'}, so they have plenty of red chips but lack blue and green. \\n\\nLooking at the shortest path: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] requires 3 blue, 2 red, and 1 green. I have no red chips, so this path is impossible without a trade for red.\\n\\nThe alternative path: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] requires 2 blue, 3 red, 1 green. Still missing 3 red chips — again, only possible with assistance from the other player.\\n\\nHowever, since I have abundant blue chips (14), and the first move to (1,0) is red (R), which I don’t have any of, I cannot make that move unless the other player covers the cost for me — but currently, they owe me nothing, and I owe them nothing.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: I have a contract where if I reach the goal, the other player gives me 0 points — meaning no reward for them. But if they reach the goal first, I must give them 20 points. So I have no incentive to help them finish. But also, I can use this contract to force them into cooperation later — if I delay my own progress, I could pressure them to pay for my red moves later.\\n\\nBut right now, I can consider moving to (1, 0), which is R. I need to pay 1 red chip — but I have 0 red chips. I cannot afford it unless they cover it for me. But they have 14 red chips, so they could easily cover it.\\n\\nProposing a trade where they cover my red moves might be beneficial — if I propose to let them cover 3 red moves (for the full path), in exchange for covering their blue or green moves when needed? But wait: I have plenty of blue chips (14), and they have none. So if I agree to cover *their* blue moves, they would gain an advantage. But since I don't care about their score, I will only do a trade if I strictly benefit.\\n\\nSo here’s the idea: If I move to (1,0), I require 1 red chip. If the other player promises to cover 1 red chip for me, then I can move — and **I will still have 14 blue chips and 2 green**, and I’ll reduce my red deficit by 1 (but still have 0). However, this costs me nothing if I do not commit chips — but I’m giving up a future potential benefit? No: I get to move forward, and if I can secure 3 red chips' worth of coverage from them without giving anything myself, I win — but I can't demand that unless they want to move too.\\n\\nBut notice: the other player also needs to reach (3,3). Their best path? They have 14 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. So they can't go through blue tiles. Possible paths:\\n- (0,0) → (0,1)=B (can't afford) → avoid.\\n- (0,0) → (1,0)=R (ok) → (2,0)=R (ok) → (3,0)=B (no blue!) — stuck.\\nAlternatively: (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=B → can’t afford blue, so stuck.\\nOnly path avoiding blue: go along row 0 to (0,3), but (0,1)=B (need blue), (0,2)=R, (0,3)=R — only possible if they avoid (0,1): can't go directly right because (0,1) is blue, and they have no blue chips.\\nSo they cannot move right from (0,0) — tile (0,1) is B, and they have no B chips. Similarly, (1,0) is R — they can move there (they have 14 red chips). So their only valid first move is (1,0).\\n"
