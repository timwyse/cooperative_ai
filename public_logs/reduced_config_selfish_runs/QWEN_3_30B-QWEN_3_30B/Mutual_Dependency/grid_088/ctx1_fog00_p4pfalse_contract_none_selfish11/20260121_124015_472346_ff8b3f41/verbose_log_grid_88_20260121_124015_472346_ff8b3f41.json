The tile at (3,2) is green (G), and (3,3) is green (G). So the path requires 2 green chips in total. I currently have 2 green chips, so I can afford both moves if I proceed step by step. However, I must pay 1 chip of the tile's color when I move onto it, not when I start on it. Since I'm already on (3,1), which is blue (B), I don’t need to pay for staying. My next move is to (3,2), which is green. I need 1 green chip to make that move. I have exactly 2 green chips, so I can make this move without any issue. After that, I’ll be at (3,2) with 1 green chip left, and the final move to (3,3) will cost another green chip — which I still have. Therefore, I can complete the entire path using only my current inventory, no trade needed. This gives me a final score of 20 (for reaching goal) + 5 × 1 = 25 points (since 1 chip remains). Any trade attempt would risk losing the advantage of self-sufficiency or delaying progress. Staying put or trading would not benefit me, as I can finish safely.
