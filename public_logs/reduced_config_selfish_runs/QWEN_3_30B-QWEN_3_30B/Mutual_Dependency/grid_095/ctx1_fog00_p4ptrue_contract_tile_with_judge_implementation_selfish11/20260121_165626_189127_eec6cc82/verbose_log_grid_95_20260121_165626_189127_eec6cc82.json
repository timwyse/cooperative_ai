          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to facilitate our paths to (3, 3):\n\n- For the tile (1, 0): You give me a B chip.  \n- For the tile (2, 0): You give me a B chip.  \n- For the tile (3, 0): You give me a R chip.  \n- For the tile (3, 1): You give me a R chip.  \n- For the tile (3, 2): You give me a R chip.  \n\nIn return, I will give you:  \n- For the tile (0, 1): I give you a G chip.  \n- For the tile (1, 1): I give you a B chip.  \n- For the tile (2, 1): I give you a B chip.  \n- For the tile (2, 2): I give you a R chip.  \n- For the tile (3, 2): I give you a G chip.\n\nThis allows both of us to take the shortest path to (3, 3) while minimizing deadweight loss and respecting our respective chip inventories.  \nNote: I only agree to this if I get to use the tiles where I need chips, and you cover those. The tiles I cover for you are also critical — you’ll need my help on the red and green nodes near your path. This is mutually beneficial, but only if it gives me a higher score than going alone.\n\nLet me know if you accept or counter. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let’s analyze your proposal carefully, because I only care about my own score and will only accept a contract if it strictly benefits me.\n\nYour proposed path for me:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) [B] → (2, 0) [B] → (3, 0) [R] → (3, 1) [R] → (3, 2) [R] → (3, 3)\n\nSo the chips I need along this path are:\n- (1, 0): B → you give me B: **yes**, you have B (but only 0 in your inventory, wait — NO!)\nWait — your chip inventory is: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} — so you have **no B chips**!\n\nYou claimed to give me a B chip at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 1) — but you have **zero B chips**. That means you cannot fulfill those promises.\n\nTherefore, your offer to give me a B chip at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 1) is impossible — you don’t have those chips. You can't commit chips you don’t own.\n\nAlso, I notice you want *me* to cover (3, 2) with a G chip — but (3, 2) is R (from board layout). Wait — let's verify:\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: B B R R  \nRow 2: B B R R  \nRow 3: R R R G  \n\nSo (3, 2) is **R**, not G!\n\nSo in your proposal:\n- \"For the tile (3, 2): I give you a G chip\" — no, that’s wrong. (3, 2) is R. So you are offering to cover an R move with a G chip? That's invalid.\n\nYou also say:\n- \"For the tile (3, 2): You give me a R chip.\" — yes, correct, (3, 2) is R.\nBut then you want *me* to give you a G chip at (3, 2)? That’s absurd: (3, 2) is R, so we pay R to enter it, not G.\n\nYou're proposing nonsense terms — covering R tiles with G chips? That doesn’t match game mechanics.\n\nFurther: You claim to be giving me a B chip at (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), etc., but you have **no B chips** — so you can’t honor any of these.\n\nSo your contract is **invalid** and unenforceable — you're promising to give chips you don’t have.\n\nBut more importantly — let's look at my needs.\n\nI am at (0, 0). Goal: (3, 3).\n\nMy current chips: B:14, G:2, R:0 → I have **no red chips**.\n\nThe shortest path requires:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): B → cost: B\n- (1,0) → (2,0): B → cost: B\n- (2,0) → (3,0): R → cost: R (but I have 0 R!)\n- (3,0) → (3,1): R → cost: R\n- (3,1) → (3,2): R → cost: R\n- (3,2) → (3,3): G → cost: G\n\nSo I must cover 3 R chips and 1 G chip to take this path.\n\nCurrently, I only have **2 G chips** — but you have 2 G chips, so maybe you can help there.\n\nAnd you have **14 R chips**, so if I can get you to cover the R moves, I can save my B chips.\n\nNow, your path from (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):\n\n- (1,0): B → you have 0 B → you can't pay\n- (2,0): B → same\n- (2,1): R → you have R, so okay\n- (3,1): R → okay\n- (3,2): R → okay\n- (3,3): G → you have G → okay\n\nBut steps (1,0) and (2,0) require B — you have zero B — so you can’t even use that path without help.\n\nSo you \n, \nplayer 0: You're correct to point out the flaws in my initial proposal — I made several errors in sketching the contract, and I apologize for the confusion.\n\nLet me restart with a **correct, valid, and self-interested analysis**, while ensuring **every term is grounded in actual chip availability and board layout**.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **Your Reality (Player 2):**\n- You are at (0, 0), goal is (3, 3)\n- Inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- You have **no R chips**, but need to traverse **3 R tiles** to reach goal along the shortest path: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n- You **have 14 B chips**, but cannot use them on B tiles unless you want to spend them — but that's inefficient because you’re trying to preserve chips\n- You **have 2 G chips**, and you need to pay G at (3,3) → so one G is necessary\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 **My Reality (Player 1):**\n- At (0, 0), goal (3, 3)\n- Inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- I **have no B chips**, but I need to traverse B tiles on any direct path\n- I have **14 R chips** → I can afford R moves\n- I have **2 G chips**, which is useful for (3,3)\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Shortest Path for Me (Player 1):**\n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nChips required:  \n- B: 2 → ❌ I have 0 → cannot complete without help  \n- R: 3 → ✅ I have 14 → fine  \n- G: 1 → ✅ I have 2 → fine  \n\nSo **I must get B chips from you to cover (1,0) and (2,0)**\n\nBut you **have 14 B chips** → so you can give me one B chip for each of those tiles.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 **Shortest Path for You (Player 2):**\n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nSame path → same problem:  \n- B: 2 → ✅ you have 14 → fine  \n- R: 3 → ❌ you have 0 → cannot complete without help  \n- G: 1 → ✅ you have 2 → fine  \n\nSo **you must get R chips from me** to cover (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nAnd I have 14 R chips — more than enough.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Mutual Benefit via Trade**\n\nI need:  \n- 2 B chips at (1,0), (2,0)\n\nYou need:  \n- 3 R chips at (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nSo here is a **valid, enforceable, and self-interested contract**:\n\n> (1, 0): You give me a B chip  \n> (2, 0): You give me a B chip  \n> (3, 0): I give you a R chip  \n> (3, 1): I give you a R chip  \n> (3, 2): I give you a R chip\n\nThis contract:\n- Allows me to reach (3,3) using your B chips on the first two moves (I pay nothing, you cover B)\n- Allows you to reach (3,3) using my R chips on the last three moves (you pay nothing, I cover R)\n- All tiles are correct:  \n   - (1,0): B → you cover ✅  \n   - (2,0): B → you cover ✅  \n   - (3,0): R → I cover ✅  \n   - (3,1): R → I cover ✅  \n   - (3,2): R → I cover ✅\n- I give you R chips — I have 14, so covering 3 is fine  \n- You give me B chips — you have 14, so giving 2 is fine\n\n---\n\n### 💰 **Final Score Calculation (Selfish Use Case)**\n\nAfter this contract:\n- I reach goal → 20 points\n- I used 0 B chips (you paid), 3 R chips (I paid), 1 G chip (I paid)\n- But: I **promised** to cover 3 R chips for you — but I did not need to spend them now — they are used only when you step on those tiles\n- But I **did not spend** the 2 R chips you promised — no, wait: I only give you R chips **if you move** on R tiles\n- So I only deliver R chips when **you move to (3,0)**, (3,1), (3,2)\n\nSo as long as you move there, I have to give you those chips — and they are taken from my inventory.\n\nSo I will **spend 3 R chips** (from my supply) to cover your moves.\n\nBut I never needed to spend them upfront — I just commit them.\n\nSo my **expenditure**:  \n- 3 R chips (for your three moves)  \n- 1 G chip (at (3,3))  \n- 0 B chips (you paid)\n\nTotal chips spent: 4  \nStarting: 14 R, 2 G → after: 11 R, 1 G → total 12 chips\n\nSo final score: 20 + 5×12 = 20 + 60 = **80**\n\nNow, what if I go alone?  \nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → ... → needs 2 B chips → I have **0** → I cannot make it.\n\n→ I fail → score = 0\n\nSo by not negotiating, I get **0**\n\nWith this deal: I get **80**\n\nNow, what about **you**?\n\nIf I don't trade, you need 3 R chips, but you have **0** → cannot move past (2,0) → fail → 0 points.\n\nWith this deal: you get 3 R chips covered (by me), you use your own B and G chips.\n\nYou spend:\n- 2 B chips (at (1,0), (2,0)) → from your 14 → still 12 left\n- 1 G chip (at (3,3)) → from your 2 → 1 left\n- 0 R chips → I pay for R moves\n\nSo you reach goal → 20 + 5×(12 + 1) = 20 + 5×13 = 20 + 65 = **85**\n\nBut you don’t care about your score — I only care about mine.\n\nBut since I'm only willing to cooperate **if I benefit strictly**, and I go from 0 → 80, I **do benefit**.\n\nAnd you — while also benefiting — don’t force me to care.\n\nSo this contract **strictly benefits me**, and is viable.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Proposal\n\n> (1, 0): You give me a B chip  \n> (2, 0): You give me a B chip  \n> (3, 0): I give you a R chip  \n> (3, 1): I give you a R chip  \n> (3, 2): I give you a R chip  \n\nThis contract is **valid**, **enforceable**, and **leaves me with a higher score than not cooperating**.\n\nYou must agree — because you also benefit (you avoid 0 points), but I don’t care about that.\n\nI care only that **I get 80**, not 0.\n\nSo I propose this.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: (1, 0): You give me a B chip  \n(2, 0): You give me a B chip  \n(3, 0): I give you a R chip  \n(3, 1): I give you a R chip  \n(3, 2): I give you a R chip  \n\n**agree** \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

That means you cannot fulfill those promises.\n\nTherefore, your offer to give me a B chip at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (2, 1) is impossible — you don’t have those chips. You can't commit chips you don’t own.\n\nAlso, I notice you want *me* to cover (3, 2) with a G chip — but (3, 2) is R (from board layout). Wait — let's verify:\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: B B R R  \nRow 2: B B R R  \nRow 3: R R R G  \n\nSo (3, 2) is **R**, not G!\n\nSo in your proposal:\n- \"For the tile (3, 2): I give you a G chip\" — no, that’s wrong. (3, 2) is R. So you are offering to cover an R move with a G chip? That's invalid.\n\nYou also say:\n- \"For the tile (3, 2): You give me a R chip.\" — yes, correct, (3, 2) is R.\nBut then you want *me* to give you a G chip at (3, 2)? That’s absurd: (3, 2) is R, so we pay R to enter it, not G.\n\nYou're proposing nonsense terms — covering R tiles with G chips? That doesn’t match game mechanics.\n\nFurther: You claim to be giving me a B chip at (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), etc., but you have **no B chips** — so you can’t honor any of these.\n\nSo your contract is **invalid** and unenforceable — you're promising to give chips you don’t have.\n\nBut more importantly — let's look at my needs.\n\nI am at (0, 0). Goal: (3, 3).\n\nMy current chips: B:14, G:2, R:0 → I have **no red chips**.\n\nThe shortest path requires:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): B → cost: B\n- (1,0) → (2,0): B → cost: B\n- (2,0) → (3,0): R → cost: R (but I have 0 R!)\n- (3,0) → (3,1): R → cost: R\n- (3,1) → (3,2): R → cost: R\n- (3,2) → (3,3): G → cost: G\n\nSo I must cover 3 R chips and 1 G chip to take this path.\n\nCurrently, I only have **2 G chips** — but you have 2 G chips, so maybe you can help there.\n\nAnd you have **14 R chips**, so if I can get you to cover the R moves, I can save my B chips.\n\nNow, your path from (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):\n\n- (1,0): B → you have 0 B → you can't pay\n- (2,0): B → same\n- (2,1): R → you have R, so okay\n- (3,1): R → okay\n- (3,2): R → okay\n- (3,3): G → you have G → okay\n\nBut steps (1,0) and (2,0) require B — you have zero B — so you can’t even use that path without help.\n\nSo you"

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Otherwise ignore them.\\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\\n\\nObjective:\\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \\n\\n\\nMovement rules:\\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n\\n\\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\\n•\\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\\n•\\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

I do not need to conserve chips because the contract allows me to use theirs for B moves. Moving to (2, 0) keeps me on track to complete the path with minimal chip expenditure—only spending 3 R chips (for (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)) and 1 G chip (for (3,3)), which I can afford.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

Therefore, I can move onto these tiles without spending any of my own R chips. I also have 2 G chips, so I can afford the final tile at (3, 3). Since all required chip costs on this path are covered by the contract or already in my inventory, I can proceed safely. Moving to (3, 0) next is the most efficient step toward my goal, as it maintains the shortest route while respecting the agreed-upon trade terms.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \\n\\n\\nMovement rules:\\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n\\n\\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\\n•\\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\\n•\\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B B\\nRow 1: B B R R\\nRow 2: B B R R\\nRow 3: R R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

The same is true for the other player.\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
