I have 12 red and 4 green — so this path is feasible. Importantly: I can begin by moving to (1,0) now, since it costs 1 red and I have 12 reds. This keeps me on a clear path toward the goal without needing trading. I’ll keep my options open: if later I need to trade for green, it might help — but right now I can proceed directly. Also, the other player is at (3,2), very close to goal, and has many blue chips (11) and zero red/green. They may want to reach (3,3) eventually and will need green — but I don’t care about them, only myself. Since I can safely move to (1,0) now (Red chip available), I should go ahead.
