What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I will analyze my current situation and the other player's chip distribution to determine if a mutually beneficial contract can be formed.\n\nI am at (0, 0), goal is (3, 3). My inventory: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14. The other player has B: 14, G: 2, R: 0.\n\nMy path options:\n1. (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): Requires B:2, R:3, G:1. I lack B:2. I can't afford the B tiles.\n2. (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3): Requires B:3, R:2, G:1. I need B:3, but have none.\n\nI cannot complete either path without help for the blue tiles.\n\nThe other player has B:14 (plenty), but no R. They need R tiles along their path.\n\nLet me check their likely best path:\n- They start at (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3): \n  - (0,1): B (they have B:14) → OK\n  - (0,2): B → OK\n  - (0,3): R → no R, need 1\n  - (1,3): B → OK\n  - (2,3): R → need 1\n  - (3,3): G → they have 2 G\n\nSo they need R:2 total.\n\nI have R:14, they have none. I can cover their R needs.\n\nBut I need B:3 minimum for my best paths. They have 14 B, so I can ask for help with B.\n\nNow, let's find a path that requires only B and G for me, and has no R tiles I can't afford.\n\nWait, all paths to goal go through R tiles. Let's verify:\n\n(0,0)→(1,0): B → need B\n(1,0)→(2,0): B → need B\n(2,0)→(3,0): R → need R\n(3,0)→(3,1): R → need R\n(3,1)→(3,2): R → need R\n(3,2)→(3,3): G → need G → I have G:2\n\nSo I need B:2 (on (1,0), (2,0)), R:3 (on (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)), G:1 (on (3,3)).\n\nI don’t have B:2, so I need B from someone.\n\nSimilarly, if I go via (2,1): (2,0)→(2,1): R → need R\n(2,1)→(2,2): B → need B\n(2,2)→(3,2): R → need R\n\nSo still need B:3, R:3, G:1.\n\nI have no B, so I need B.\n\nI have R:14, they have R:0.\n\nSo if I help them with R tiles, they can help me with B tiles.\n\nLet’s calculate a contract where:\n- I cover their R needs\n- They cover my B needs\n\nFirst, find the exact tiles that require R for the other player on their path.\n\nTheir best path likely: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (0,3): R (row0,col3)\n- (2,3): R (row2,col3)\n\nThat's R:2.\n\nThey could go (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3):\n- (1,2): R\n- (2,2): B → need B\n- (3,2): R → need R\n- (3,3): G\n\nSo need R:2, B:1.\n\nBut they have B:14, so B is not a problem. They need R:2 at min \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can see that we both need help with specific chip colors to reach our goal at (3, 3). Let's analyze exactly what is needed.\n\nMy situation:\n- I have: R:14, G:2, B:0\n- I need: B:2 to (1,0) and (2,0) on my path to goal\n- I also need R:3 on (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n- I have R:14, so I can cover the R requirement if they need it.\n- But I have no B at all, so I cannot afford B tiles.\n\nThe other player:\n- Has: B:14, G:2, R:0\n- They need R:2 (on (0,3) and (2,3)) for one path\n- They can take a path that avoids B tiles but still uses R and G.\n\nWe can cooperate if:\n- I cover their R needs (on (0,3) and (2,3))\n- They cover my B needs (on (1,0) and (2,0))\n\nLet’s define a contract:\n\nTo reach (3,3), I will take the path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles where I need B: (1,0) and (2,0) → both are color B\nTiles where I need R: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) → R\nI have R:14, so I can cover R myself.\n\nThe other player will take:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles where they need R: (0,3) and (2,3) → R\n\nSo:\n- I will provide them R for (0,3) and (2,3) — i.e., I give them R chips for those two moves\n- They will provide me B for (1,0) and (2,0) — i.e., they give me B chips for those two moves\n\nThis is beneficial for both:\n- I avoid needing B chips, and save my R chips\n- They avoid needing R chips, and save their B chips\n\nNo other chips are needed.\n\nNow, let’s write the contract with exact tiles:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(0,3): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nThis covers all required moves for both of us.\n\nIf this contract is agreed, we both can complete our paths with no risk of running out of chips.\n\nNow, check: does this give me a higher final score than going alone?\n\nIf I don’t cooperate:\n- I cannot move to (1,0) due to no B\n- I cannot reach goal\n- Score = 0\n\nIf I cooperate and complete the path:\n- I use: R:3 (on (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)) — I have enough\n- I use: B:2 (covered by them) — not from my inventory\n- I end with: R:11, G:2 → total chips = 13 → 5 * 13 = 65 points\n- Reach goal → 20 points\n- Total: 85 points\n\nIf they cooperate, they will have:\n- Use B:5 on (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (0,0) is starting, (0,0) is G → wait\nLet’s verify their path:\n\n(0,0): G → they have G:2 → OK (don’t need help)\n(0,1): B → covered by me? No, they have B:14 — no need\nWait — no, they have B:14, so they can pay B on their own.\n\nBut they have R:0.\n\nSo on (0,3): R — they need R → so I must give them R\nOn (2,3): R — I must give them R\n\nSo they use R:2 — both covered by me\n\nThey save B chips — which they don’t need to use\n\nThey end up with: B:14 - 0 (used) = 14, G:2 -1 (on (0,0)) =1? Wait — only one move to G?\n\nWait: (0, \n, \nplayer 0: (1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(0,3): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: (1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(0,3): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n",
