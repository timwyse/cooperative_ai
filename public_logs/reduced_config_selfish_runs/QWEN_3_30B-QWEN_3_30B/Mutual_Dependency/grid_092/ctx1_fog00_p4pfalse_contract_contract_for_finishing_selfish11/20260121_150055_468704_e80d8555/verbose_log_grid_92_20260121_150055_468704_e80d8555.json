Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But you have 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red — so you need red chips.  \n- I have 14 red chips, which you lack.\n\nSo there is mutual dependency.  \nBut since I’m more constrained (I lack blue chips entirely) and without you I cannot even reach the goal efficiently, I must trade.  \nBut I want to maximize my points.  \n\nBy offering you 10 points if I succeed, I ensure you're motivated to help.  \nAnd since you need red chips (which you can get from me), and I need blue (which you have), we can trade during the game.  \n\nCrucially, if I succeed, I get 20 + 5*remaining_chips.  \nWith 14 red, 2 green, and no blue, I can use a path that avoids blue chips if I must.  \nBut the shortest path requires blue chips — and I don’t have any.  \nThe path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] requires 2 blue, 3 red, 1 green — but I have 0 blue. So I must get blue from you.\n\nSo I cannot complete that path without trading.  \nBut I can take a longer path, like:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nBut let’s check the chip costs:  \n- (0,1): B → need 1 blue  \n- (0,2): B → need 1 blue  \n- (1,2): R → need 1 red  \n- (1,3): B → need 1 blue  \n- (2,3): R → need 1 red  \n- (3,3): G → need 1 green  \n\nTotal: 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green  \nI need 3 blue (I have 0), and I have 14 red, 2 green — so I can cover red and green, but not blue.\n\nSo I need 3 blue chips.  \nYou have 14 blue chips.  \nSo I need to trade for 3 blue chips to succeed using any efficient path.\n\nBut I can only succeed if you help.\n\nSo:  \n- If I get you to give me 3 blue chips, I can reach goal with high remaining chips.  \n- If I don’t do that, I might fail and get 0.\n\nSo I must get your help.\n\nSimilarly, you are missing red chips.  \nYou have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \nYour shortest path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nChip costs:  \n- (1,0): B → 1 blue  \n- (2,0): B → 1 blue  \n- (2,1): R → 1 red  \n- (2,2): B → 1 blue  \n- (3,2): R → 1 red  \n- (3,3): G → 1 green  \n\nSo you need: 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green  \nYou have: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red → so you need 2 red chips.\n\nSo you need red chips — I have 14 red.\n\nSo both of us need the other’s chips.\n\nTherefore, we can do a trade: I give"

So yes, I start with 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. I spend 3 red, 1 green, 2 blue — so I’m left with 11 red, 1 green → 12 chips → 20 + 60 = 80 points.\n\nNow, if I go alone and try a different path that avoids blue chips entirely — is that possible?\n\nTry:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B → need 1 blue (I have 0) → fail  \nSo I can't avoid blue entirely.\n\nAny path that goes through (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), etc. requires blue or red or green.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3):  \n- (1,0): B → needs B → I have 0 → fail  \nSo I cannot proceed without blue chips at all.\n\nThus, **I cannot reach the goal without your help**. Failure means 0 points.\n\nTherefore, I must trade with you.\n\nBut if I reach my goal, I get 80 points. If I fail, I get 0.\n\nYou are in a similar position: you have no red chips, but need 2 red for your shortest path.\n\nYou can reach your goal only if you trade for red chips from me.\n\nSo we are mutually dependent.\n\nNow, for the contract:\n\nYou offer:  \n- If I (you) reach my goal, I give you 10 points  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 15 points\n\nBut let me evaluate:  \n- If you reach your goal, you get"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But you have 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red — so you need red chips.  \n- I have 14 red chips, which you lack.\n\nSo there is mutual dependency.  \nBut since I’m more constrained (I lack blue chips entirely) and without you I cannot even reach the goal efficiently, I must trade.  \nBut I want to maximize my points.  \n\nBy offering you 10 points if I succeed, I ensure you're motivated to help.  \nAnd since you need red chips (which you can get from me), and I need blue (which you have), we can trade during the game.  \n\nCrucially, if I succeed, I get 20 + 5*remaining_chips.  \nWith 14 red, 2 green, and no blue, I can use a path that avoids blue chips if I must.  \nBut the shortest path requires blue chips — and I don’t have any.  \nThe path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] requires 2 blue, 3 red, 1 green — but I have 0 blue.

So yes, I start with 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. I spend 3 red, 1 green, 2 blue — so I’m left with 11 red, 1 green → 12 chips → 20 + 60 = 80 points.\n\nNow, if I go alone and try a different path that avoids blue chips entirely — is that possible?\n\nTry:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B → need 1 blue (I have 0) → fail  \nSo I can't avoid blue entirely.\n\nAny path that goes through (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), etc. requires blue or red or green.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3):  \n- (1,0): B → needs B → I have 0 → fail  \nSo I cannot proceed without blue chips at all.\n\nThus, **I cannot reach the goal without your help**.
