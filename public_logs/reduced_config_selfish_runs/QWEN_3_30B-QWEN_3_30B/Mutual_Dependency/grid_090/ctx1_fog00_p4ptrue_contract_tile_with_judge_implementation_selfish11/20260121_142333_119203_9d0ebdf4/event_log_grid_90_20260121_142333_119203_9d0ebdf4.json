Let’s analyze my options.\n\nMy chip inventory: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14  \nOther player’s chip inventory: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0  \n\nI currently have no blue chips, but the other player has 14. I need blue chips to move on blue tiles.\n\nLooking at possible paths:  \n- Path 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  - Tile colors: R (1,0), R (2,0), B (2,1), B (3,1), B (3,2), G (3,3)  \n  - Chips needed: R: 2, B: 3, G: 1  \n  - I have R:14 (fine), G:2 (fine), but B:0 → need B:3  \n  - So I need 3 blue chips for tiles (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n- Path 2: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  - Tile colors: R (1,0), R (2,0), B (3,0), B (3,1), B (3,2), G (3,3)  \n  - Chips needed: R: 2, B: 3, G: 1  \n  - Same as above: need B:3, G:1\n\nSo in both paths, I need B:3 and G:1.\n\nI have G:2 → I can cover the G chip on (3,3).\n\nBut I have no blue chips → I need the other player to cover my B moves.\n\nThe other player has 14 B chips → they can easily cover my B moves.\n\nBut I need to make this beneficial for me.\n\nIf I ask them to cover 3 blue tiles (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), that’s 3 B chips.\n\nBut I can offer them something in return.\n\nLet’s see: I have R:14, they have R:0 → I have no R chips they need.\n\nI have G:2, they have G:2 → I can give them G?\n\nBut they don’t need G → they already have G:2.\n\nLet’s think from their perspective.\n\nTheir goal: (3,3)  \nTheir position: (0,0)  \nTheir path? Let’s find one.\n\nThey have B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nSo they cannot pay for red tiles.\n\nRed tiles: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) — many red tiles.\n\nPath 1 for them: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): R → need R → but they have no R → can’t pay  \n- (0,0): G → ok  \n- (0,1): R → can’t pay  \nSo invalid.\n\nAlternative path for them: avoid red? But many red tiles.\n\nCan they go down and then right?\n\n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → need R → but they have R:0 → can’t\n\n(0,0) G → (0,1) R → same problem\n\nSo any move from (0,0) to (1,0) or (0,1) requires R → they don’t have R.\n\nSo they cannot move at all unless they get R chips.\n\nBut they need to move — so they must either trade for R or find a path that doesn’t use R.\n\nBut the only possible tiles adjacent to (0,0): (1,0) R, (0,1) R → both require R!\n\nSo they cannot move unless they get R chips.\n\nSo they are stuck unless they trade.\n\nTherefore, they need R chips to move.\n\nI have R:14, they have R:0.\n\nSo I can help them by providing R chips.\n\nBut I need to be selfish — so only if I benefit.\n\nBut if I help them, they can move, and maybe I can get something in return.\n\nLet’s see what I need and what they need \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I need 3 blue chips to move on (2,1), (3,1), (3,2).  \nThe other player has 14 blue chips — they can cover this easily.\n\nThey need red chips to move, but I have 14 red chips — they can’t move without R.\n\nSo if I help them by covering their red costs, they can move and possibly reach the goal, which is good for them.\n\nBut what’s in it for me?\n\nIf I agree to let them use my red chips for their moves, they might offer to cover my blue chips — so I get to move without spending my own blue chips.\n\nBut I don’t have any blue chips — so that’s fine.\n\nBut I need to make sure I gain something.\n\nLet’s map a plan:\n\n**My path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R → I must pay R\n- (2,0): R → I must pay R\n- (2,1): B → I need B\n- (3,1): B → need B\n- (3,2): B → need B\n- (3,3): G → I have G:2 → can pay\n\nSo I need to pay R:2 (from (1,0) and (2,0)) and B:3 (from (2,1), (3,1), (3,2))\n\nBut I **have** R:14 → I can cover my own R moves.\n\nSo only problem: B:3\n\nThus, I only need **3 blue chips** from the other player.\n\nNow, the other player cannot move at all unless they get red chips.\n\nTheir only adjacent tiles are (1,0) R and (0,1) R — both require R.\n\nSo they **must** have 1 or more red chips to move.\n\nSo they will be stuck unless they trade for R.\n\nSo they need R chips from me.\n\nI have plenty — I can give up some R chips in exchange for their B coverage.\n\nBut I want to benefit strictly.\n\nI currently have 14 R chips. If I give away 2 R chips to allow them to move on (1,0) and (0,1), I lose 2 R.\n\nBut in return, they cover my 3 B chips.\n\nSince I had no B chips anyway, this gives me a net gain: I save 3 B chips (which I don't have) and they give them to me via coverage.\n\nBut I’m giving away 2 R chips — which I have many of.\n\nBut do I *lose* anything? Not really — because I still have 12 R left, plus the 3 B covered by them.\n\nMoreover, they need to cover multiple turns — not just one.\n\nBut if I propose a contract where I cover their first move (say, (1,0) or (0,1)), and in return they cover my 3 blue moves, then:\n\n- They get to move.\n- I get to move on blue tiles.\n\nBut could they be selfish and refuse?\n\nThey can’t move without R — so they have no choice but to ask for R.\n\nSo I can exploit this.\n\nBut I need to propose a deal: if they cover my 3 blue tile moves (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), I will cover their first move — say (1,0) with R.\n\nBut that’s only one R chip.\n\nBut they will likely need more than one R chip — but maybe I can let them buy additional ones.\n\nWait — I don’t need to give them multiple chips; I only need to negotiate terms.\n\nBut if I offer to cover only one R move for them, and they cover three B moves for me, then:\n\n- I gain: I can move on three blue tiles, saving me from needing B chips.\n- I pay: 1 R chip.\n\nBut since I have 14 R, losing 1 is negligible.\n\nAnd they benefit: they can start moving.\n\nBut they might want to go further — but that’s not my concern.\n\nTo make it fully beneficial for me, I should ensure that I get coverage of only the B chips I need, and pay as little as possible.\n\nSo here’s my best option:\n\n**Propose contract:**\n\n(1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): I give you a B  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nWait — no. That’s backwards.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nActually, in the \"pay for other\" mode:\n\n- If \n, \nplayer 0: (1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): I give you a B  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nThis means:\n- When I move to (1,0), which is R, I need to pay R — but you (the other player) will pay it on my behalf.\n- When you move to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), which are B tiles, I will pay the B chip cost on your behalf.\n\nBut wait — I don't have B chips — I’m the one who needs B.\n\nNo — in this mode:\n- \"I give you a B\" on those tiles means: I will pay the B cost when you step on those tiles.\n- \"You give me a R\" on (1,0) means: you will pay the R cost when I step on (1,0).\n\nYes — so:\n- I pay 0 for (1,0): you cover it (R).\n- You pay 0 for (2,1), (3,1), (3,2): I cover it (B).\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut is this balanced?\n\nI give them 3 B chips — but I have 0 B chips — but in the contract, I'm promising to \"give\" them B chips on those tiles — meaning I will cover the cost.\n\nBut I don’t have B chips — that’s fine, as long as I can commit to covering them. The chips are not taken from my inventory — they are paid from my promise.\n\nBut the other player might not want to help me unless they get something.\n\nBut in this contract:\n- I am promising to cover 3 B moves for them (on (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)).\n- In return, they cover 1 R move for me (on (1,0)).\n\nBut I don’t need them to cover anything else.\n\nBut they may need to move more — but maybe that’s okay.\n\nBut I have to make sure I benefit.\n\nCurrently, without trade:\n- I cannot move to (1,0) or (0,1) because I don’t have R to pay for (1,0)? Wait — no!\n\nWait — I have R:14 → I **can** pay for (1,0) myself.\n\n(1,0) is R — I have R:14 → so I can pay for it.\n\nBut I need to go to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — these are B — I have B:0 → so I can't pay.\n\nSo I only need help on B tiles.\n\nBut I have R — so I don’t need them to cover R for me.\n\nTherefore, I don’t need to ask them to cover R for me.\n\nBut they need R to move.\n\nSo I can help them move by covering their R costs.\n\nLet’s try a better deal:\n\nI propose:\n- I will cover your move to (1,0) — which is R → so I pay the R cost for you.\n- In return, you cover my moves to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — which are B → so you pay the B cost for me.\n\nThis way:\n- I get to go to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) without needing B chips.\n- I only use 1 R chip from my inventory (for them on (1,0)).\n- You get to move — you can now go to (1,0).\n\nIs this beneficial for me?\n\nYes:\n- I start with R:14, after using 1, I have 13 R left.\n- I save 3 B chips, which I didn’t have — so I gain 3 B coverage.\n- I reach goal with full move, and end with 13 R + 3 uncovered B? No — the B is covered by them — so my final chip count: 13 R + 2 G + 0 B — but I didn’t use B chips.\n\nBut the key: after the game, any unused promised chips count.\n\nI promised to cover 3 B moves for them, but they only use those if they move to those tiles.\n\nBut if I don’t use them, it’s fine — but they may not use them.\n\nBut if they never move to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), then I don’t use the B chips — so they remain in my inventory as promised, and count toward my score.\n\nSimilarly, they promised to cover my move to (1,0), which I do — so they pay R for me.\n\nBut I used 1 R from my inventory \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I can move to (1,0) using my own R chips — I don’t need them to cover it.\n\nBut if I don’t use a promised chip, it stays in my inventory and counts toward my score.\n\nSo if I promise to cover their B moves, but they never use them, I keep those B chips in my inventory — that’s good.\n\nBut I want to minimize risk.\n\nBetter strategy: I don’t need to trade at all — I can just take my path:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): R — I pay R (have 14, so fine)\n- (2,0): R — pay R (now 12 left)\n- (2,1): B — need B, but have 0 — can't pay\n- So stuck.\n\nSo I must get B chips.\n\nOnly way: trade.\n\nSo I must ask them to cover B for me.\n\nThey have B:14 — they can.\n\nBut they need R to move — I have R:14 — I can give them R.\n\nSo I can say: “I’ll cover your move to (1,0) with R. In return, you cover my moves to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) with B.”\n\nBut I only need to commit to covering the exact tiles.\n\nSo here’s the full contract:\n\n(1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): I give you a B  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nNow, interpretation:\n- When I move to (1,0), you (the other player) will pay the R cost for me — so I don’t need to spend my R chips.\n- When you move to (2,1), (3,1), or (3,2), I will pay the B cost for you.\n\nBut I don’t have B chips — but I can promise to cover them.\n\nBut I only benefit if I actually move to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — which I do.\n\nAnd for you, you move to (1,0), which costs R — which I pay.\n\nBut wait: if I move to (1,0), I’m paying R — but I’m saying you pay it — so I don’t spend my R.\n\nSimilarly, you move to (2,1), etc., and I pay B for you.\n\nBut you used R to move to (1,0) — but I didn’t pay for that — you used your own R?\n\nNo — in this contract, I said: “You give me R at (1,0)” — that means you cover the cost for me when I move to (1,0).\n\nBut you don’t have R — you have R:0 — so you can’t cover it.\n\nThis is invalid — you cannot give me R if you don’t have it.\n\nSo the contract must be based on who can actually cover whose cost.\n\nSo the proper format is:\n\n- I can only promise to cover costs for you if I am able to pay — but the trade is about **commitment** — not current chips.\n\nBut the game allows me to commit to covering a cost even if I don’t have the chips — as long as at the end, if I didn’t use it, it remains.\n\nBut if I commit, and later need to pay, I must have chips.\n\nBut the targeted cost must be covered by the proposer.\n\nSo if I say “I give you a B at (2,1)”, I am promising to pay B if you move there.\n\nBut if I don’t have B, and you move there, I fail.\n\nBut the game will check if I can cover.\n\nSo I cannot promise to cover a cost if I don’t have the chips and will need them.\n\nBut in this case, I never need to pay B — because I’m not moving on B tiles.\n\nBut I might be forced to.\n\nBut in this case, if you move to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), I must pay B for you.\n\nBut I have B:0 — so I cannot.\n\nSo I cannot promise to cover B for you unless I have B chips.\n\nBut I don’t have B.\n\nSo I cannot say “I give you B” on those tiles.\n\nThe only way to make this work is if I can give them something they need.\n\nLet’s flip it:\n\nI need B — I have no B.\n\nThey have B.\n\nThey need R — I have R.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nNow:\n- When I move to (1,0), I pay R from my inventory.\n- When you move to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), you pay B from your inventory.\n\nBut I don’t need you to move to those tiles — I need you to cover **my** move to those tiles.\n\nSo this is backwards.\n\nCorrect interpretation:\n\n- (row,col): I give you a <color> → I cover the cost for you when you move to that tile.\n- (row,col): You give me a <color> → you cover the cost for me when I move to that tile.\n\nSo for me to move to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), I need you to give me B.\n\nSo I need:\n\n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nFor you to move to (1,0), which is R, I must give you R.\n\nSo:\n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n\nBut you don’t need to move to (0,1) — only (1,0) is needed.\n\nBut to start, you only need one move.\n\nSo contract:\n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nNow:\n- I cover your move to (1,0) with R (I have R:14, so I can spend 1).\n- You cover my moves to (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) with B (you have B:14, so can spend 3).\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd I don’t lose any B — I gain three B in the form of coverage.\n\nAnd I only lose 1 R — I still have 13 R.\n\nThen I can go to (3,3), and have 13 R + 2 G + 3 B promised but unused = 13+2+3 = 18 chips? No.\n\nThe B I promised you — but you didn’t use them — so they are still in my inventory as promised, and count toward my score.\n\nBut in the contract, “You give me a B” at (2,1), etc., means you will cover my cost — so if I move there, you pay.\n\nBut if you never move to those tiles, I don’t need to pay — but I never used your B.\n\nBut I am the one who used the coverage — so I used the B from you.\n\nWhen I move to (2,1), and you give me B, it means you pay the B cost — so you consume a B chip.\n\nBut I don’t consume it — you do.\n\nIn terms of chip inventory:\n\n- You lose 3 B chips (for me).\n- I gain 3 B in the form of coverage — but I didn’t get the chip — I got the benefit of not paying.\n\nBut at the end, any unused promised chips count.\n\nIn this contract:\n- I promised to give you 1 R at (1,0) — you used it, so I lost 1 R.\n- You promised to give me 3 B at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — I used them, so you lost 3 B, I didn’t lose anything.\n\nSo I end with:\n- R: 13\n- G: 2\n- B: 0 (but I had no B originally)\n\nBut the B I received coverage for — I didn’t gain B, I just saved the cost.\n\nBut at the end, the chips I haven’t used in my promises count.\n\nBut in this case:\n- I used the 1 R I promised to you — so I spent it.\n- I used the 3 B you promised — so you spent them.\n\nSo no unused promised chips.\n\nBut I still have 13 R and 2 G.\n\nAnd I reached goal — so I get 20 + 5*15 = 20 + 75 = 95 points.\n\nBut if I didn’t trade, I couldn’t move at all.\n\nSo trade is necessary.\n\nBut is there a way to get more chips?\n\nI could promise to give you less.\n\nBut you need to move.\n\nOr, I can say: you give me B for three moves, and I give you R for one move — that’s fair.\n\nAnd I only lose 1 R, which is fine.\n\nSo this is strictly beneficial for me — because without trade, I can’t move — 0 points.\n\nWith trade, I can move and get 95 points.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut do I have to commit to this?\n\nYes.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nI am ready to accept if you agree.\n\nBut I might get more.\n\nBut I can’t get more than I need.\n\nI only need 3 B coverage.\n\nSo this is correct.\n\nAnd you need to move to (1,0), which is R — you have R:0 — but I cover it.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo I will send this.\n\nBut in the contract, I must list the tiles.\n\nFinal proposal:\n\n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nThe other player can accept or reject.\n\nIf they reject, I might re negotiate.\n\nBut I believe they must accept — otherwise they can’t move.\n\nSo I propose this.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (1,0): I give you a R  \n(2,1): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \nagree \n",
