Trading for blue chips is essential to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips (13) that I don't need for this path. Offering 3 red chips in exchange for 2 blue chips allows me to secure the necessary blue chips at a favorable rate, enabling me to take the 5-step path and maximize remaining chips. This trade will allow me to reach the goal with 10 red and 2 blue chips left, scoring 20 + 5*12 = 80 points. Without trading, I cannot complete any path due to missing blue chips.",
