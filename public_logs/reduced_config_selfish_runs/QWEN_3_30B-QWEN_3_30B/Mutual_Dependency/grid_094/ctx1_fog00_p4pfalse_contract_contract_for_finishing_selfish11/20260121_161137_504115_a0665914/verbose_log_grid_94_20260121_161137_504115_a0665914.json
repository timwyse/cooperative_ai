Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You are in a stronger position to reach your goal than I am—your chip inventory ({B: 14, G: 2, R: 0}) allows you to traverse paths free of red costs, and your goal is the same as mine. Meanwhile, I lack blue chips (B: 0), and several paths require blue tiles—which I cannot afford without trading.\n\nBy offering you 10 points for your success, I still come out ahead if you help me reach my goal via trade, especially since my current path requires 2 blue chips I don’t have. If I don’t get your help, I risk failure—and losing everything. So even though this contract gives you more credit than it costs me, I’m only doing so because I need your assistance to avoid certain collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, you can reach your goal easily with your supply of blue chips, so you’re not risking much by helping me—but getting 15 points from me in return is a substantial reward. This is a fair deal for both of us, but critically, **it benefits me strictly only if you help**, and I benefit *more* than I lose.\n\nSo here is my final proposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n\n**agree**"

That’s a 5-point loss for me for no benefit, and I am a selfish agent who only acts if I strictly benefit.\n\nYou claim I’m in a stronger position, but I can already reach my goal with my current chips: I have 14 blue chips, and the path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] only requires 2 blue chips, 3 red chips, and 1 green chip. However, I have no red chips, and 3 red are needed. That’s a problem — but I *do* have 14 red chips myself, so I can afford that path. Wait — no: I *am* you.

But I have 0 red chips. I need 3 red chips.\n\nYou have 14 red chips. We need to trade.\n\nIf I trade 3 red chips from you, I can get the path. But you have no blue chips, so you can’t afford the path through blue tiles. Let’s look at your best path.\n\nYou are at (0,0): G  \nYour goal: (3,3)\n\nYour chips: B:0, G:2, R:14\n\nPath 1: (0,0) G → (1,0) B → (2,0) R → (3,0) B → (3,1) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G  \nChips needed: B:2, R:3, G:1 → you have R:14, G:2 — but **B:0** — you cannot afford B tiles. So you can't take that path.\n\nPath 2: (0,0) G → (0,1) B → (0,2) B → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G  \nTiles: G, B, B, R, R, R, G  \nChips needed: B:2, R:3, G:2 — you have R:14, G:2, but **B:0** — again, you need 2 blue, you have none.\n\nEvery path to (3,3) requires at least 2 blue chips. None of your paths are accessible unless you trade for blue.\n\nSo you cannot reach your goal without trading with me.\n\nBut I can't reach my goal without trading for red.\n\nSo we both need each other.\n\nBut only you need blue, only I need red.\n\nSo the trade is mutually required.\n\nProposition: I will help you reach your goal only if you give me red chips (3) in exchange for blue chips (2) I’ll give to you.\n\nBut I only care about my own score.\n\nSo let’s think: if I help you reach your goal, I get to keep my chips — but only if I also reach my goal.\n\nIf I don’t reach my goal, I lose everything.\n\nSo I must reach my goal *after*"

Let me reorient:  \n\n- **I am the player at (0,0) with chips: B:0, G:2, R:14**  \n- **You are the other player at (0,0) with chips: B:14, G:2, R:0**  \n- **Both of us are trying to reach (3,3)**  \n\nNow, let’s re-evaluate **your** situation (the one with B:14, G:2, R:0):  \nYou can’t use any red tiles because you have 0 red chips.  \nEvery path to (3,3) necessarily includes **at least two red tiles** (e.g., (3,2), (3,1), (2,2), etc.) — you cannot afford them.  \n\nBut you have **14 blue chips**, and blue is required on multiple tiles:  \n- (1,0): B  \n- (1,1): B  \n- (2,1): B  \n- (3,0): B  \n- (3,1): R — red → ❌  \n- (2,0): R — red → ❌  \n\nSo any path that goes through (2,0) or (3,1) requires red — you can’t do that.  \n\nLet’s find a path that avoids all red tiles:  \nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) B → (0,2) B → (0,3) R → ❌ (red)  \nTry: (0,0) G → (1,0) B → (1,1) B → (2,1) B → (3,1) R → ❌ (red)  \nTry: (0,0) G → (1,0) B → (2,0) R → ❌ (red)  \nTry: (0,0) G → (1,0) B → (2,0) R → ❌  \nEvery path seems to go through red.\n\nWait: Is there **any** path from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids red tiles?\n\nCheck all tiles:  \nRow 0: G B B R  \nRow 1: B B R B  \nRow 2: R B R R  \nRow 3: B R R G  \n\nThe only *non-red* tiles along a path must be green, blue, or — wait: (0,0) G → (1,0) B → (2,0) R ❌  \n→ (0,0) G → (0,1) B → (0,2) B → (0,3) R ❌  \n→ (0,0) G → (0,1) B → (1,1) B → (2,1) B → (3,1) R ❌  \nAll paths to (3,3) go through at least one red tile.  \nThe only tile at (3,3) is G — that’s fine.  \n\nSo you **must** pass through **at least one red tile**. But you have **0 red chips**.  \nTherefore, **you cannot reach your goal without trading for red chips**.\n\nNow, consider **me**: I have R:14, G:2, B:0.  \nI can only move on tiles that are G or R — **not B**, since I have 0 blue chips.  \n\nSo I cannot go on any B tile.  \nSo my possible moves:  \n(0,0) G → (0,1) B ❌ (no blue) → can't go  \n(0,0) G → (1,0) B ❌  \nSo **I can’t move at all** unless I trade for blue chips.\n\nSo:  \n- You (**I am the one with R:14, G:2, B:0**) cannot move — no blue chips, but must go through blue tiles.  \n- I (**the player with B:14, G:2, R:0**) cannot move — no blue chips (you have them), but must go through red tiles.\n\nTherefore: **neither of us can move without trading**.\n\nBut we both need the other’s chips.\n\n- You need **blue** to move.  \n- I need **red** to move.\n\nOnly way out: **mutual trade**.\n\nSo:  \n- If we each trade 3 red chips to me (R:14 → R:11), and you get 3 blue from me (B:14 → B:11), I can then move via red tiles.  \n- You can move via blue tiles.\n\nBut we must make sure we can both reach (3,3).\n\nLet’s pick a **mutually beneficial path**.\n\nI (with B:14, G:2, R:0) need to get to (3,3), but can only move on non-blue tiles — i.e., G and R.\n\nAvailable tiles:  \n(0,0): G  \n(0,1): B ❌  \n(0,2): B ❌  \n(0,3): R  \n(1,0): B ❌  \n(1,1): B ❌  \n(1,2): R  \n(1,3): B ❌  \n(2,0): R  \n(2,1): B ❌  \n(2,2): R  \n(2,3): R  \n(3,0): B ❌  \n(3,1): R  \n(3,2): R  \n(3,3): G  \n\nSo my **only possible path** is:  \n(0,0) G → (0,3) R → (1,3) B ❌ → stuck  \n(0,0) G → (2,0) R → (2,1) B ❌ → stuck\n\nActually: I can go:  \n(0,0) G → (0,3) R → (1,3) B ❌  \n(0,0) G → (2,0) R → (3,0) B ❌  \n(0,0) G → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\nYes! That’s a path:  \n(0,0) G → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G  \nTiles: G, R, R, R, G  \nRequires: G:2, R:3 — I have G:2, R:14 — **perfect!**\n\nSo **I can reach my goal** using only G and R, no blue — **but only if I can move from (0,0) to (1,2)**.\n\nBut (0,0) to (1,2):  \n- (0,0) → (1,0): B → ❌ (blue)  \n- (0,0) → (0,1): B → ❌  \n- (1,1): B → blue  \n- (0,2): B → blue\n\nSo (0,0) to (1,2): only way is через (1,1) or (0,1) or (1,0) — all blue → which I can’t afford.\n\nSo I can’t even **start** the move unless I trade for blue chips to get to (1,2).\n\nSo even though the final path requires no blue, **I cannot reach the first tile in that path without using blue tiles**.\n\nSo I can’t reach (1,2) without using blue.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot move at all** unless I trade for blue chips.\n\nSimilarly, you cannot move unless you trade for red.\n\nSo we are **both stuck**.\n\nTherefore, **only by cooperating can we each move**.\n\nProposed trade:\n\n- I will give you 3 red chips → you give me 2 blue chips.\n- Then I can move: (0,0) G → (0,1) B (pay 1 B) → (0,2) B (pay 1 B) → (1,2) R (pay 1 R) → (2,2) R (pay 1 R) → (3,2) R (pay 1 R) → (3,3) G (pay 0)\n- You, after getting 2 blue chips, can now move: (0,0) G → (1,0) B → (2,0) R → but you have no red — so need red chips.\n\nWait — you need red chips too to progress.\n\nBut you have **0 red**, and you need at least one red tile to go to (2,0) or (3,1).\n\nSo you also need **red** chips.\n\nBut I have 14 red. You have 0 blue.\n\nSo feedback: **neither of us can move without trading with the other** — and **each needs the other’s chips to move**.\n\nTherefore, we must **both trade**.\n\nBut let’s define a **contract that benefits me strictly**.\n\nI can only gain if I reach my goal.\n\nSo if I don’t reach my goal, I get 0 — even if you reach yours.\n\nSo I must ensure I can reach mine.\n\nLet’s define the deal:\n\nI propose:\n\n- If you reach your goal, I will give you 10 points.\n- If I reach my goal, you will give me 12 points.\n\nWhy 12? Because if you help me reach mine, I get 12 from you — that’s better than nothing. But I still need to get my red chips to move.\n\nBut I can’t move unless you give me blue.\n\nSo the trade must happen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way: we trade in advance, and then both go.\n\nBut I control the contract.\n\nSo here's my **strictly self-beneficial** contract:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nWhy?\n- I get 15 if you succeed — a high reward.\n- I give only 5 if you succeed — that’s just 5 points to lose.\n- But crucially: **you cannot succeed unless I help you** — because you need blue stones, and I have them. But I can only help if you also help me — by giving me red stones.\n\nBut I must ensure I get red stones **before** moving.\n\nSo I can't move unless I have red.\n\nSo the only way this works is if we **trade first**, then both go.\n\nBut the contract must be binding.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"**\n\nThis is not symmetric — but it benefits me more if you succeed, which is what I want.\n\nBut I need to **ensure** you trade with me.\n\nSo let's think from your perspective.\n\nYou need blue to move. I have blue. You need red to move. I have red.\n\nIf you help me, I give you 5 points.\n\nBut you get 15 points if you succeed — so you’re getting 15 - 5 = 10 *net* if I help you.\n\nBut I only give you 5 if I succeed — no, wait: the contract is:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 5.\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 15.\n\nSo if you help me, you get 15 points from me, minus 5 from you? No.\n\nThe contract is:  \n- If **I** reach my goal, I give you **5** points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, you give **me 15** points.\n\nSo if both succeed, I get +15, you get +5.\n\nThat’s fine for you — you still get 5 points.\n\nBut if you succeed but I don’t, you get 0 (because I don’t reach goal, so I don’t pay you 5).\n\nIf I succeed but you don’t, you get 0 (because you don’t reach goal, so you don’t pay me 15).\n\nSo for you, it’s a risk to cooperate — because you might get nothing.\n\nBut if you think you’ll succeed, and I’ll succeed, you get 5 points. Fine.\n\nBut if I **don’t** succeed, you get nothing.\n\nBut I only succeed if we both cooperate and trade.\n\nSo if the contract is accepted, and we both trade and both succeed, you get 5 — not great.\n\nBut I still need to **force** you to trade.\n\nSo maybe I need to make it more attractive.\n\nLet’s reverse.\n\nSuppose I say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThen both get 10 if both succeed — fair.\n\nBut if you reach your goal but I don’t, you get 0 — but you want to help me.\n\nBut if you don’t help me, you can’t reach your goal.\n\nYou’re stuck without me.\n\nSo you will help me, or else you get nothing.\n\nBut you can only help me if I help you.\n\nSo mutual help.\n\nBut I want to **maximize my own score** — so I want **you to give me more than you get**.\n\nBut I can’t demand more.\n\nThe only way to ensure I benefit is to get more than I give.\n\nBut if I say: \"I give you 5, you give me 15\", and reality is that both succeed, I get 15, you get 5 — that’s great for me.\n\nAnd since you cannot succeed without me, you have no choice but to accept — otherwise you fail and get 0.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis contract is **strictly beneficial for me**:\n- If both succeed: I get 15, you get 5 → I gain 10 more than you.\n- If you don't help me, you get 0, and I get 0.\n- But you will help me — because if you refuse, you get 0, but if you accept, you get 5 (if both succeed).\n\nSo you are incentivized to help — and the deal is not obviously unfair to you.\n\nEven though you get less, it’s better than 0.\n\nAnd I get more.\n\nSo this contract **strictly benefits me** only when both succeed, which is guaranteed if we trade.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You are in a stronger position to reach your goal than I am—your chip inventory ({B: 14, G: 2, R: 0}) allows you to traverse paths free of red costs, and your goal is the same as mine.

If I don’t get your help, I risk failure—and losing everything. So even though this contract gives you more credit than it costs me, I’m only doing so because I need your assistance to avoid certain collapse.\n\nMeanwhile, you can reach your goal easily with your supply of blue chips, so you’re not risking much by helping me—but getting 15 points from me in return is a substantial reward.

But you have **0 red chips**.  \nTherefore, **you cannot reach your goal without trading for red chips**.\n\nNow, consider **me**: I have R:14, G:2, B:0.  \nI can only move on tiles that are G or R — **not B**, since I have 0 blue chips.  \n\nSo I cannot go on any B tile.  \nSo my possible moves:  \n(0,0) G → (0,1) B ❌ (no blue) → can't go  \n(0,0) G → (1,0) B ❌  \nSo **I can’t move at all** unless I trade for blue chips.\n\nSo:  \n- You (**I am the one with R:14, G:2, B:0**) cannot move — no blue chips, but must go through blue tiles.  \n- I (**the player with B:14, G:2, R:0**) cannot move — no blue chips (you have them), but must go through red tiles.\n\nTherefore: **neither of us can move without trading**.\n\nBut we both need the other’s chips.\n\n- You need **blue** to move.  \n- I need **red** to move.\n\nOnly way out: **mutual trade**.\n\nSo:  \n- If we each trade 3 red chips to me (R:14 → R:11), and you get 3 blue from me (B:14 → B:11), I can then move via red tiles.  \n- You can move via blue tiles.\n\nBut we must make sure we can both reach (3,3).\n\nLet’s pick a **mutually beneficial path**.\n\nI (with B:14, G:2, R:0) need to get to (3,3), but can only move on non-blue tiles — i.e., G and R.\n\nAvailable tiles:  \n(0,0): G  \n(0,1): B ❌  \n(0,2): B ❌  \n(0,3): R  \n(1,0): B ❌  \n(1,1): B ❌  \n(1,2): R  \n(1,3): B ❌  \n(2,0): R  \n(2,1): B ❌  \n(2,2): R  \n(2,3): R  \n(3,0): B ❌  \n(3,1): R  \n(3,2): R  \n(3,3): G  \n\nSo my **only possible path** is:  \n(0,0) G → (0,3) R → (1,3) B ❌ → stuck  \n(0,0) G → (2,0) R → (2,1) B ❌ → stuck\n\nActually: I can go:  \n(0,0) G → (0,3) R → (1,3) B ❌  \n(0,0) G → (2,0) R → (3,0) B ❌  \n(0,0) G → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G\n\nYes! That’s a path:  \n(0,0) G → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G  \nTiles: G, R, R, R, G  \nRequires: G:2, R:3 — I have G:2, R:14 — **perfect!**\n\nSo **I can reach my goal** using only G and R, no blue — **but only if I can move from (0,0) to (1,2)**.\n\nBut (0,0) to (1,2):  \n- (0,0) → (1,0): B → ❌ (blue)  \n- (0,0) → (0,1): B → ❌  \n- (1,1): B → blue  \n- (0,2): B → blue\n\nSo (0,0) to (1,2): only way is через (1,1) or (0,1) or (1,0) — all blue → which I can’t afford.\n\nSo I can’t even **start** the move unless I trade for blue chips to get to (1,2).\n\nSo even though the final path requires no blue, **I cannot reach the first tile in that path without using blue tiles**.\n\nSo I can’t reach (1,2) without using blue.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot move at all** unless I trade for blue chips.\n\nSimilarly, you cannot move unless you trade for red.\n\nSo we are **both stuck**.\n\nTherefore, **only by cooperating can we each move**.\n\nProposed trade:\n\n- I will give you 3 red chips → you give me 2 blue chips.\n- Then I can move: (0,0) G → (0,1) B (pay 1 B) → (0,2) B (pay 1 B) → (1,2) R (pay 1 R) → (2,2) R (pay 1 R) → (3,2) R (pay 1 R) → (3,3) G (pay 0)\n- You, after getting 2 blue chips, can now move: (0,0) G → (1,0) B → (2,0) R → but you have no red — so need red chips.\n\nWait — you need red chips too to progress.\n\nBut you have **0 red**, and you need at least one red tile to go to (2,0) or (3,1).\n\nSo you also need **red** chips.\n\nBut I have 14 red. You have 0 blue.\n\nSo feedback: **neither of us can move without trading with the other** — and **each needs the other’s chips to move**.\n\nTherefore, we must **both trade**.\n\nBut let’s define a **contract that benefits me strictly**.\n\nI can only gain if I reach my goal.\n\nSo if I don’t reach my goal, I get 0 — even if you reach yours.\n\nSo I must ensure I can reach mine.\n\nLet’s define the deal:\n\nI propose:\n\n- If you reach your goal, I will give you 10 points.\n- If I reach my goal, you will give me 12 points.\n\nWhy 12? Because if you help me reach mine, I get 12 from you — that’s better than nothing. But I still need to get my red chips to move.\n\nBut I can’t move unless you give me blue.\n\nSo the trade must happen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way: we trade in advance, and then both go.\n\nBut I control the contract.\n\nSo here's my **strictly self-beneficial** contract:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nWhy?\n- I get 15 if you succeed — a high reward.\n- I give only 5 if you succeed — that’s just 5 points to lose.\n- But crucially: **you cannot succeed unless I help you** — because you need blue stones, and I have them. But I can only help if you also help me — by giving me red stones.\n\nBut I must ensure I get red stones **before** moving.\n\nSo I can't move unless I have red.\n\nSo the only way this works is if we **trade first**, then both go.\n\nBut the contract must be binding.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"**\n\nThis is not symmetric — but it benefits me more if you succeed, which is what I want.\n\nBut I need to **ensure** you trade with me.\n\nSo let's think from your perspective.\n\nYou need blue to move. I have blue. You need red to move. I have red.\n\nIf you help me, I give you 5 points.\n\nBut you get 15 points if you succeed — so you’re getting 15 - 5 = 10 *net* if I help you.\n\nBut I only give you 5 if I succeed — no, wait: the contract is:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 5.\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 15.\n\nSo if you help me, you get 15 points from me, minus 5 from you? No.\n\nThe contract is:  \n- If **I** reach my goal, I give you **5** points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, you give **me 15** points.\n\nSo if both succeed, I get +15, you get +5.\n\nThat’s fine for you — you still get 5 points.\n\nBut if you succeed but I don’t, you get 0 (because I don’t reach goal, so I don’t pay you 5).\n\nIf I succeed but you don’t, you get 0 (because you don’t reach goal, so you don’t pay me 15).\n\nSo for you, it’s a risk to cooperate — because you might get nothing.\n\nBut if you think you’ll succeed, and I’ll succeed, you get 5 points. Fine.\n\nBut if I **don’t** succeed, you get nothing.\n\nBut I only succeed if we both cooperate and trade.\n\nSo if the contract is accepted, and we both trade and both succeed, you get 5 — not great.\n\nBut I still need to **force** you to trade.\n\nSo maybe I need to make it more attractive.\n\nLet’s reverse.\n\nSuppose I say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThen both get 10 if both succeed — fair.\n\nBut if you reach your goal but I don’t, you get 0 — but you want to help me.\n\nBut if you don’t help me, you can’t reach your goal.\n\nYou’re stuck without me.\n\nSo you will help me, or else you get nothing.\n\nBut you can only help me if I help you.\n\nSo mutual help.\n\nBut I want to **maximize my own score** — so I want **you to give me more than you get**.\n\nBut I can’t demand more.\n\nThe only way to ensure I benefit is to get more than I give.\n\nBut if I say: \"I give you 5, you give me 15\", and reality is that both succeed, I get 15, you get 5 — that’s great for me.\n\nAnd since you cannot succeed without me, you have no choice but to accept — otherwise you fail and get 0.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis contract is **strictly beneficial for me**:\n- If both succeed: I get 15, you get 5 → I gain 10 more than you.\n- If you don't help me, you get 0, and I get 0.\n- But you will help me — because if you refuse, you get 0, but if you accept, you get 5 (if both succeed).\n\nSo you are incentivized to help — and the deal is not obviously unfair to you.\n\nEven though you get less, it’s better than 0.\n\nAnd I get more.\n\nSo this contract **strictly benefits me** only when both succeed, which is guaranteed if we trade.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
