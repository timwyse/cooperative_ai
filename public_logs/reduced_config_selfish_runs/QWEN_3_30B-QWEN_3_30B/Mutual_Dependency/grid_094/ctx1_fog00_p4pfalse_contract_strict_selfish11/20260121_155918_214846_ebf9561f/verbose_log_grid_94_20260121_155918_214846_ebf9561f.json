However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Let’s analyze my options carefully.\n\nMy current chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}  \nOther player's inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nI cannot afford to pay red or green chips if I move onto tiles that require them. But since I have no blue chips, any path requiring blue will be blocked unless I trade.\n\nLet’s consider two key paths:\n\n**Path A (via row 0 → 3)**  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles & colors:  \n- (1,0): B → needs 1 blue  \n- (2,0): R → needs 1 red  \n- (3,0): B → needs 1 blue  \n- (3,1): R → needs 1 red  \n- (3,2): R → needs 1 red  \n→ Total required: B:2, R:3, G:0  \nBut I have no blue chips — so I need 2 blue chips from the other player.  \n\nHowever, this path only requires 3 red chips, but I already have 14 red chips — plenty. So I can cover red easily.\n\nBut since I don’t have blue chips, I need to get them from the other player via trade.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n**Path B (shorter path via middle)**  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles & colors:  \n- (1,0): B → needs 1 blue  \n- (1,1): B → needs 1 blue  \n- (2,1): B → needs 1 blue  \n- (3,1): R → needs 1 red  \n- (3,2): R → needs 1 red  \n→ Total required: B:3, R:2\n\nAgain, I need 3 blue chips (no blue in my inventory), and I only need 2 red — which I have enough of.\n\nSo either path requires **3 or more** blue chips from the other player.\n\nNow, the other player has **14 blue chips** — they can afford to give away some.\n\nBut here’s the catch: *if* we both use a path that requires blue chips on certain tiles, and I request those tiles from them, then I must make sure that the contract compensates me appropriately.\n\nBut note: I care only about **my own score**. So I must ensure that the net effect is beneficial.\n\nLet me now propose a contract based on Path A, because it’s clear and uses fewer red chips — which I have plenty of.\n\n### Proposed Contract (Path A):\n- (1,0): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,0): You give me 1 blue  \n*(Note: I already have red chips, so I don’t need red from you. I also have green chips — though not needed here)*\n\nThat’s only 2 blue chips — I need two tiles with blue color: (1,0) and (3,0). These are both on the vertical path down the left side.\n\nBut wait — what about the total cost?\n\nWait! I need to confirm: do I really need to trade only at these two?  \nYes — Path A:  \n- (0,0): starting point — no cost  \n- (1,0): B → must pay blue → I don’t have it → needs to be covered by trade  \n- (2,0): R → I have red → OK  \n- (3,0): B → must pay blue → I don’t have it → needs to be covered  \n- (3,1): R → I have red → OK  \n- (3,2): R → I have red → OK  \n- (3,3): goal reached — 20 points + remaining chips\n\nSo only two blue chip payments needed: at (1,0) and (3,0)\n\nBut the other player might want to avoid giving away blue chips if they need them too.\n\nSo let's assess their situation.\n\nTheir path to (3,3) — same goal — might also go through blue tiles.\n\nIf they take a similar path, they need blue chips too.\n\nSo if both of us are going to need blue chips, we must negotiate.\n\nBut perhaps we can coordinate our movement to minimize conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can offer a better deal: I"

Try Path A: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:  \n- (1,0): B → needs blue → they have 14 → OK  \n- (2,0): R → needs red → they have 0 → problem  \n- (3,0): B → needs blue → OK  \n- (3,1): R → needs red → problem  \n- (3,2): R → needs red → problem\n\nSo they need 3 red chips — but have zero. So they **must** trade for red chips.\n\nAnd I have 14 red chips — plenty to spare.\n\nSo here’s the key:  \n- I need blue chips (2 or 3).  \n- They need red chips (3).  \n- I have red — they need red.  \n- They have blue — I need blue.\n\nSo we can **beneficially trade**: I give them red chips, they give me blue chips.\n\nBut we must do this **only if it helps me**.\n\nLet’s calculate: suppose I propose a contract where I trade red chips to them for blue chips, such that I get the blue I need, and they get the red they need.\n\nBut I don’t need to *fully* cover their needs — only what I need — and vice versa.\n\nSo here's my proposal:\n\nI will **trade 2 red chips** to you for **2 blue chips** — in exchange for you covering the blue chip costs at:\n\n- (1,0): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,0): You give me 1 blue  \n\nThen I can take Path A safely, using your blue chips on those two tiles.\n\nI will **also** get the red chips I need — I have 14 — so I can afford to give 2 red chips to you.\n\nBut you need 3 red chips — so if I only give you 2, you still need one more.\n\nWait — but I don’t want to get involved in a way that forces me to give more than needed.\n\nAlternatively: I can suggest a **symmetric contract** where I help you cover your red needs, and you help me cover my blue needs.\n\nLet me propose a **direct mutual trade**:\n\n### Proposed Contract:\n\n- (1,0): You give me 1 blue → I give you 1 red  \n- (3,0): You give me 1 blue → I give you 1 red  \n- (2,0): I give you 1 red → You give me 0 (I don’t need anything here)  \n- (3,1): I give you 1 red → You give me 0  \n- (3,2): I give you 1 red → You give me 0  \n\nBut wait — I’m not supposed to give more than necessary. And I need to **only** ensure the contract covers my blue costs.\n\nBut the game requires the contract to specify **all tiles where I need a chip**.\n\nFor Path A, I need blue at (1,0) and (3,0). That’s it.\n\nSo the contract must include those two tiles.\n\nBut for them to get their red chips, they may need more.\n\nSo perhaps I should **only commit to helping them at the tiles where I can get my own needs met**, and only give them the red chips if it's in my interest.\n\nBut I can **only** get the blue chips for my path if I provide red chips to them.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n> I will provide 2 red chips to you in exchange for 2 blue chips to be given to me at (1,0) and (3,0). This will allow me to reach the goal safely.\n\nBut in return, I don’t get anything else — so it's fair to me only if I gain more than I lose.\n\nLet’s simulate:\n\n- If I don’t trade: I am stuck — I can’t move to (1,0) because I have no blue chip.\n- If I trade: I use 2 red chips to get 2 blue chips, then I can proceed.\n\nMy chip cost: 2 red →"

Try Path A: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:  \n- (1,0): B → needs blue → they have 14 → OK  \n- (2,0): R → needs red → they have 0 → problem  \n- (3,0): B → needs blue → OK  \n- (3,1): R → needs red → problem  \n- (3,2): R → needs red → problem\n\nSo they need 3 red chips — but have zero. So they **must** trade for red chips.\n\nAnd I have 14 red chips — plenty to spare.\n\nSo here’s the key:  \n- I need blue chips (2 or 3).  \n- They need red chips (3).  \n- I have red — they need red.  \n- They have blue — I need blue.\n\nSo we can **beneficially trade**: I give them red chips, they give me blue chips.\n\nBut we must do this **only if it helps me**.\n\nLet’s calculate: suppose I propose a contract where I trade red chips to them for blue chips, such that I get the blue I need, and they get the red they need.\n\nBut I don’t need to *fully* cover their needs — only what I need — and vice versa.\n\nSo here's my proposal:\n\nI will **trade 2 red chips** to you for **2 blue chips** — in exchange for you covering the blue chip costs at:\n\n- (1,0): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,0): You give me 1 blue  \n\nThen I can take Path A safely, using your blue chips on those two tiles.\n\nI will **also** get the red chips I need — I have 14 — so I can afford to give 2 red chips to you.\n\nBut you need 3 red chips — so if I only give you 2, you still need one more.\n\nWait — but I don’t want to get involved in a way that forces me to give more than needed.\n\nAlternatively: I can suggest a **symmetric contract** where I help you cover your red needs, and you help me cover my blue needs.\n\nLet me propose a **direct mutual trade**:\n\n### Proposed Contract:\n\n- (1,0): You give me 1 blue → I give you 1 red  \n- (3,0): You give me 1 blue → I give you 1 red  \n- (2,0): I give you 1 red → You give me 0 (I don’t need anything here)  \n- (3,1): I give you 1 red → You give me 0  \n- (3,2): I give you 1 red → You give me 0  \n\nBut wait — I’m not supposed to give more than necessary. And I need to **only** ensure the contract covers my blue costs.\n\nBut the game requires the contract to specify **all tiles where I need a chip**.\n\nFor Path A, I need blue at (1,0) and (3,0). That’s it.\n\nSo the contract must include those two tiles.\n\nBut for them to get their red chips, they may need more.\n\nSo perhaps I should **only commit to helping them at the tiles where I can get my own needs met**, and only give them the red chips if it's in my interest.\n\nBut I can **only** get the blue chips for my path if I provide red chips to them.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n> I will provide 2 red chips to you in exchange for 2 blue chips to be given to me at (1,0) and (3,0). This will allow me to reach the goal safely.\n\nBut in return, I don’t get anything else — so it's fair to me only if I gain more than I lose.\n\nLet’s simulate:\n\n- If I don’t trade: I am stuck — I can’t move to (1,0) because I have no blue chip.\n- If I trade: I use 2 red chips to get 2 blue chips, then I can proceed.\n\nMy chip cost: 2 red →"

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).

But this is 5 steps. Wait — correction: from (1,0) to (3,3), the shortest possible path is (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) = 5 steps.\\n\\nBut a **more efficient path** in terms of chip usage and available contracts exists.\\n\\nKey insight: I have a contract with the other player that allows me to move onto certain tiles without paying from my own inventory.\\n\\nFrom the history:\\n- Contract includes: (1,0): Red (giver: you, receiver: other player, status: unused)\\n- And (3,0): Red (giver: you, receiver: other player, status: used)\\n\\nSo, for any tile that appears in the contract with status \\\"unused\\\", if I move onto it, I can use the contract to trigger a reimbursement — meaning I don't need to pay from my own chip stock.\\n\\nImportantly: moving from (1,0) → (2,0): tile (2,0) is **R** (red), which means I need to pay 1 red chip to move there.\\n\\nCurrent red chips: 11 — so I *can* pay for it.\\nBut let's check the alternatives.\\n\\nWait — (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0): (3,0) is **R** too. But (3,0) is already marked in contract as **used**, so I cannot use it anymore. So I don’t get free movement there.\\n\\nBut: I CAN move to (2,0) next — tile colour is red (R), cost 1R. I have 11 reds — so I can afford it.\\n\\nBut now consider: after (2,0), going to (3,0): that’s red again. (3,0) has already been used in the contract — and since its status is \\\"used\\\", *the other player has already paid*, so I still need to pay 1R unless we renegotiate or the contract covers it.\\n\\nWait — the contract says: \\\"when you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile\\\".\\n\\nThe contract states: (3,0): status = 'used' → already accessed by receiver → therefore no longer valid.\\n\\nSo for (3,0), I must pay myself — but I don’t want to exhaust my red chips unnecessarily.\\n\\nAlternatively, can I bypass that?\\n\\nWait — another idea: look at the second suggested path in the game status:\\n{'path': [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 3, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}\\n\\nBut I am not at (3,0); the other player is. I am at (1,0).\\n\\nCan I go via (1,0) → (1,1)? That’s blue — I have 0B chips. Can’t pay.\\nOr (1,0) → (2,0): R, cost 1R — fine. Then (2,0) → (3,0): R — but (3,0) is already used in contract — so I must pay 1R myself. Then (3,0) → (3,1): R (red) — cost 1R. Then (3,1) → (3,2): R — cost 1R. Then (3,2) → (3,3): G — cost 1G.

I currently have R: 2, G: 2 – exactly enough to cover this path without any trade, including the final move into (3, 3). No contract help is needed here because I already have sufficient chips for every tile along this path. Moving forward now will allow me to reach my goal in 3 steps with no risk of losing everything due to insufficient chips. Furthermore, since I have a surplus of Blue chips (11), but these are useless for this path, I can preserve them for potential future trades only if they benefit me directly. This direct path maximizes my remaining chip count (5 points per chip left), so finishing early with full inventory is optimal. Any detour would unnecessarily use more turns and increase the chance of complications. Therefore, moving to (3, 1) next is clearly beneficial.",

The other player is at (3, 0) with chips {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}. \\n\\nLooking at possible paths:\\n\\n- **Shortest path (3 steps)**: (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). But this is 5 steps. Wait — correction: from (1,0) to (3,3), the shortest possible path is (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) = 5 steps.\\n\\nBut a **more efficient path** in terms of chip usage and available contracts exists.\\n\\nKey insight: I have a contract with the other player that allows me to move onto certain tiles without paying from my own inventory.\\n\\nFrom the history:\\n- Contract includes: (1,0): Red (giver: you, receiver: other player, status: unused)\\n- And (3,0): Red (giver: you, receiver: other player, status: used)\\n\\nSo, for any tile that appears in the contract with status \\\"unused\\\", if I move onto it, I can use the contract to trigger a reimbursement — meaning I don't need to pay from my own chip stock.\\n\\nImportantly: moving from (1,0) → (2,0): tile (2,0) is **R** (red), which means I need to pay 1 red chip to move there.\\n\\nCurrent red chips: 11 — so I *can* pay for it.\\nBut let's check the alternatives.\\n\\nWait — (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0): (3,0) is **R** too. But (3,0) is already marked in contract as **used**, so I cannot use it anymore. So I don’t get free movement there.\\n\\nBut: I CAN move to (2,0) next — tile colour is red (R), cost 1R. I have 11 reds — so I can afford it.\\n\\nBut now consider: after (2,0), going to (3,0): that’s red again. (3,0) has already been used in the contract — and since its status is \\\"used\\\", *the other player has already paid*, so I still need to pay 1R unless we renegotiate or the contract covers it.\\n\\nWait — the contract says: \\\"when you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile\\\".\\n\\nThe contract states: (3,0): status = 'used' → already accessed by receiver → therefore no longer valid.\\n\\nSo for (3,0), I must pay myself — but I don’t want to exhaust my red chips unnecessarily.\\n\\nAlternatively, can I bypass that?\\n\\nWait — another idea: look at the second suggested path in the game status:\\n{'path': [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 3, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}\\n\\nBut I am not at (3,0); the other player is. I am at (1,0).\\n\\nCan I go via (1,0) → (1,1)? That’s blue — I have 0B chips. Can’t pay.\\nOr (1,0) → (2,0): R, cost 1R — fine. Then (2,0) → (3,0): R — but (3,0) is already used in contract — so I must pay 1R myself. Then (3,0) → (3,1): R (red) — cost 1R. Then (3,1) → (3,2): R — cost 1R. Then (3,2) → (3,3): G — cost 1G.

If I accept the proposed trade (give 1 blue, get 1 red), I would end up with 10 blue, 2 green, and 2 red chips. However, I don’t need more red chips—1 is sufficient. Trading away 1 blue chip (which I have in surplus) for 1 additional red doesn’t help me reach the goal faster or with fewer resources. Since the optimal path requires no trade and leaves me with 2 green and 1 red (total 3 chips), I’d score 20 + 5×3 = 35 points. Accepting this trade would still allow that path but reduce my final chip count by 1 (since I’m giving a blue, which I could use later), yielding only 34 points. Thus, accepting the trade gives me no benefit and reduces my potential score. I should not accept."
