Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My current chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The other player has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14'}, so they have plenty of red chips but lack blue and green. \\n\\nLooking at the shortest path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This requires 3 blue (B), 2 red (R), and 1 green (G). I have 14 blue and 2 green, but no red — so I’m missing 2 red chips for this path. \\n\\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This requires 2 blue, 3 red, 1 green. Again, I have no red chips, so I must either trade for red or find a way to reach the goal without paying for red moves.\\n\\nHowever, if I move to (1,0), which is red (R), I currently have zero red chips — so I cannot make that move unless the other player commits to covering the cost of this red move for me.\\n\\nBut here’s the key insight: **The contract** states that if I reach my goal, the other player gives me 20 points. If the other player reaches their goal, I give them 20 points. Since I care only about my own score, I have no incentive to help them finish early — but I do want to avoid getting penalized by failing to reach my goal. So I must ensure I can reach (3, 3) regardless.\\n\\nNow, consider moving to (0,1) instead — that's blue (B). I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford that move. But from (0,1), the next step is (1,1), which is red — again, I don’t have red chips.\\n\\nSo both possible initial moves (1,0) and (0,1) lead to red tiles later on, requiring red chips I don’t have.\\n\\nHowever, I notice that in the first proposed path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), tiles are: G→R→B→B→R→R→G. Wait: (0,0) is G, (1,0) is R, (2,0) is B, (3,0) is B, (3,1) is R, (3,2) is R, (3,3) is G.\\n\\nWait — correction: board layout:\\nRow 0: G B R R → (0,0)=G, (0,1)=B, (0,2)=R, (0,3)=R\\nRow 1: B R B B → (1,0)=B, (1,1)=R, (1,2)=B, (1,3)=B\\nRow 2: R R B R → (2,0)=R, (2,1)=R, (2,2)=B, (2,3)=R\\nRow 3: B B R G → (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G\\n\\nSo (0,0) is G → (0,0) = G, color G\\n(1,0) = B (not R! I made a mistake earlier)\\nLet me correct:\\n- (0,0): G\\n- (1,0): B\\n- (2,0): R\\n- (3,0): B\\n- (3,1): B\\n- (3,2): R\\n- (3,3): G\\n\\nSo path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\nTiles: G → B → R → B → B → R → G\\nCost per tile: 1 chip each\\nTotal cost: B (1), R (2), B (2), B (2), R (1), G (1"
