The shortest path to my goal is [(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires 4 moves and uses chips: {'B': 1, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}. I currently have 12 B, 2 G, and 0 R chips. However, I am missing 2 R chips for this path, which I do not have. The other player has 14 R chips but no B chips, and only 2 G chips. Since I need red chips and the other player has many, a trade involving covering red moves could benefit me. If I propose a trade where I cover 2 red moves for them (they are short on B, but I can help them with R), and in return they cover 2 red moves for me, that would let me bypass the red chip shortage on my path. However, I must ensure I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me. I currently cannot move on the path because I lack 2 red chips.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
