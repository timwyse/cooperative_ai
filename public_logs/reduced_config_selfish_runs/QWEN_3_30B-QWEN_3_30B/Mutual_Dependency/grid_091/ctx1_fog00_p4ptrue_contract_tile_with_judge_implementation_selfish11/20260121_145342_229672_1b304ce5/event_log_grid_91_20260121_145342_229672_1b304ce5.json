What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to help both of us reach our goals efficiently:\n\n- We both need to move from (0,0) to (3,3), and we’re both starting at (0,0).  \n- My current path prioritizes using red and green chips, but I’m short on blue chips for my preferred path.  \n- The other player has 14 blue chips but no red chips, which is critical for my path — so I can’t use the shorter path without assistance.  \n- I can help the other player by covering their red costs, since I have 14 red chips.\n\nLet’s define a contract based on the shortest path for each of us:\n\n**My path**: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Tiles and required chips:  \n  - (1,0): R (red) — I have red, so no issue  \n  - (2,0): R (red) — I have red  \n  - (3,0): R (red) — I have red  \n  - (3,1): B (blue) — I need 2 blue chips, but I have 0 → I need the other player to cover this  \n  - (3,2): B (blue) — another blue → need 2 blue chips again  \n  - (3,3): G (green) — I have 2 green chips → I can cover this\n\nSo for my path, I need **2 blue chips** at (3,1) and (3,2).\n\n**Their path**: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): R (red) — they have 0 red chips → they need help  \n- (1,1): B (blue) — they have 14 blue — they can cover this  \n- (2,1): R (red) — they need red → I can cover this  \n- (3,1): B (blue) — they can cover this  \n- (3,2): B (blue) — they can cover this  \n- (3,3): G (green) — they have 2 green — they can cover this\n\nSo their path requires **2 red chips** at (1,0) and (2,1) — these I can cover.\n\nSo here’s my proposal:\n\n- I will cover the **red chips** required by the other player at:\n  - (1,0): You give me a R  \n  - (2,1): You give me a R  \n\n- In return, you will cover the **blue chips** for me at:\n  - (3,1): I give you a B\n  - (3,2): I give you a B\n\nThis benefits both of us:\n- I don’t need blue chips — you cover them for me, and I have plenty of red to give you.\n- You don’t need red chips — I cover them for you, and you have plenty of blue to give me.\n\nThus, I will strictly benefit: I reach goal with full red/green inventory and gain 5 points per remaining chip (I’ll have 14-2 = 12 red left, 2 green, plus 10 from the two blue chips you promised).  \nYou benefit too — you get to complete safely and keep your 14 blue and 2 green.\n\nBut I only care about my score — and this contract allows me to complete the goal with **14 red - 2 used to cover you = 12 red left**, **2 green**, and **2 blue promised but not used** (so 2 more chips in my inventory).\n\nTotal chips at end: 12 red + 2 green + 2 blue = 16 chips → 16 × 5 = 80 points  \nPlus 20 for goal = **100 points**\n\nWithout this, I can’t complete — because I need 2 blue chips and have 0 → I’d fail → 0 points.\n\nSo this is a **strict improvement** for me.\n\nTherefore, I propose:\n\n(1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): You give me a R  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: (1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): You give me a R  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \nagree \n",
