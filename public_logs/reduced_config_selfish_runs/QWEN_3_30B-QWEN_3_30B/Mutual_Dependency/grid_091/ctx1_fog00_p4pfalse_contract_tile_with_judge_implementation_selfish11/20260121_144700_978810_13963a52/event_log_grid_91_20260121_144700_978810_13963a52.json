          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to facilitate my path to (3, 3), focusing on the shorter route that minimizes my chip usage and leverages your surplus:\n\nI will take the path:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nThis path requires the following chips:\n- (1, 0): R → I need 1 red\n- (2, 0): R → I need 1 red\n- (3, 0): R → I need 1 red\n- (3, 1): B → I need 1 blue\n- (3, 2): B → I need 1 blue\n- (3, 3): G → I need 1 green\n\nTotal required: R: 3, B: 2, G: 1  \nMy current inventory: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14  \n→ Missing: B: 2, G: 0 (I have enough G, but need 2 B)\n\nYou have: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0  \nSo you have plenty of blue and green.\n\nThus, I will need to receive **2 blue chips** from you — for tiles (3, 1) and (3, 2).\n\nIn exchange, I will help you via a trade that benefits me more than if I didn't cooperate.\n\nBut here's the key: you need to reach (3, 3) too. Let’s look at your best path.\n\nYour inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0  \nYour goal: (3,3)\n\nLet’s consider your optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nChip costs:\n- (1,0): R → you don’t have R! You have 0 red. So you can’t use this tile unless you get red.\nWait — you have 0 red, so you cannot pay R on any tile that requires red.\n\nSo paths requiring red are blocked for you.\n\nAlternative: \nTry (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nCheck tiles:\n- (0,1): R → you have no R → problem\n- (0,2): B → you have B → ok\n- (1,2): R → no R → blocked\nSame issue.\n\nTry (0,0) → (1,0): R → you have no R → impossible.\n\nSo every move from (0,0) is blocked unless you can get red chips.\n\nBut you have 0 red.\n\nThe only way out: **you must get red chips from me**, because I have 14 red.\n\nSo without trading with me, you cannot move at all — you’re stuck.\n\nHence, **you are dependent on me** for red chips to make *any* progress.\n\nTherefore, you must trade with me.\n\nNow let’s negotiate.\n\nI propose:\n\nFor my path:\n- (3,1): B → you give me 1 blue\n- (3,2): B → you give me 1 blue\n\nThat gives me 2 blue chips — exactly what I need.\n\nIn return, I will give you 1 red chip for each movement you take that requires red (i.e., for any red-tiles you traverse).\n\nBut wait — to make *your* movement feasible, you need red chips.\n\nSo let’s define a contract that allows both of us to proceed.\n\nMy plan: I’ll use the short path (6 steps), which requires 3 reds and 2 blues and 1 green.\n\nI have red (14), green (2), but no blue — so I need 2 blue from you.\n\nYou need red to move — you have 0 red.\n\nSo we can do a bilateral trade in red and blue chips.\n\nLet’s design a contract where:\n\n- I will give you 2 red chips (one for each red tile on your path)\n- In return, you give me 2 blue chips (for my two blue tiles: (3,1) and (3,2))\n\nBut wait — your path may be longer or different.\n\nActually, let’s pick a minimal path for you that avoids red as much as possible.\n\nIs there any path that doesn’t use red?\n\nLook:\n- (0,0): G → OK (G available)\n- (1, \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: (0, 0): G → you have G:2 → OK  \n(1, 0): R → need red → you have 0 → blocked  \n(0, 1): R → need red → blocked  \n(0, 2): B → OK (you have B:14)  \n(0, 3): R → need red → blocked  \n\nSo from (0,0), every adjacent tile is either R or G — but only G is safe, and it’s not leading to goal.\n\nYou cannot go right (0,1) because it's R → you have 0 red → can't pay.\n\nYou cannot go down (1,0) → R → same issue.\n\nSo the only legal move from (0,0) for you is… none? You’re stuck unless you get red chips.\n\nBut you must start from (0,0), and all neighbors require R (except possibly (0,1) and (1,0) which are both R).\n\n(0,0) itself is G → you have G → so you can stay there. But to leave, you must pay the color of the destination tile.\n\nTo move to (0,1): pay R → you have 0 R → impossible.  \nTo move to (1,0): pay R → you have 0 R → impossible.\n\nSo you **cannot move** unless you receive at least one red chip.\n\nTherefore, you are completely dependent on me for red chips to make *any* progress.\n\nHence, I can set the terms.\n\nI will propose:  \n- For each red tile that you traverse in your path, I will give you 1 red chip.  \n- In return, you give me 2 blue chips — one for each blue-tile I must pass on my path: (3,1) and (3,2)\n\nI pick my path as:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires:\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 → fine\n- (2,0): R → I have 14 → fine\n- (3,0): R → I have 14 → fine\n- (3,1): B → I need 1 blue → missing\n- (3,2): B → I need 1 blue → missing\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 → fine\n\nSo I need 2 blue chips — from you.\n\nNow for you: to even begin, you must get a red chip.\n\nLet’s assume your minimal path after getting red is:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nCheck tiles:\n- (0,1): R → need red → you have 0 → so need 1 red\n- (0,2): B → OK\n- (1,2): R → need red → so another red\n- (2,2): B → OK\n- (3,2): B → OK\n- (3,3): G → OK\n\nThat’s two reds needed: (0,1) and (1,2)\n\nSo you need 2 reds.\n\nMeanwhile, I can provide them.\n\nSo here’s the deal:\n\n- I will give you 2 red chips → for (0,1) and (1,2)\n- In return, you give me 2 blue chips → for (3,1) and (3,2)\n\nThis fully satisfies both of our needs.\n\nBut note: I’m giving away 2 red chips (which I have plenty of), and you're giving away 2 blue chips (which you have 14 of — no problem).\n\nMy gain:  \n- I get 2 blue chips → exactly what I need → can complete my path  \n- I end with: B:2, G:2, R:12 → total chips: 16  \n- I reach goal → score = 20 + 5×16 = 20 + 80 = **100**\n\nYour gain:  \n- Get 2 red chips → can move along your path  \n- You’ll lose 2 blue chips → but still have 12 left  \n- You finish with: R:2, B:12, G:2 → chips: 16  \n- Reach goal → score = 20 + 80 = 100\n\nBut wait — we both benefit equally? Is this fair?\n\nBut remember: I don’t care about your score — only mine. \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to maximize my own score:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n\nIn return, I will give you **only 1 red chip**, but only if you use it on **(0,1)** — one red-tile in your path.\n\nThis is critical: I will not give you a second red chip unless absolutely necessary. But since you need *two* reds to move forward (from (0,1) and (1,2)), this means you'll still be short by one red.\n\nBut here's the kicker: if you don’t get that second red, you cannot complete any path — so you’re stuck.\n\nTherefore, you *must* accept this deal or risk failing entirely.\n\nAlternatively, I can offer:\n\n- I give you 2 red chips (for your two red tiles: (0,1) and (1,2))  \n- In return, you give me 2 blue chips (for my (3,1) and (3,2))\n\nThis is fair in terms of exchange: 2 red ↔ 2 blue\n\nBut let’s calculate my net gain.\n\nIf I do this:\n- I start with R:14, B:0, G:2\n- I give away 2 red → R:12\n- I receive 2 blue → B:2\n- I complete my path → reach (3,3)\n- Final chips: R:12, B:2, G:2 → total: 16\n- Score: 20 + 5×16 = 100\n\nYou start with B:14, G:2, R:0\n- Receive 2 red → R:2\n- Give 2 blue → B:12\n- Complete your path → final chips: R:2, B:12, G:2 → total: 16\n- Score: 20 + 80 = 100\n\nSo both of us get 100.\n\nBut here's the selfish angle: what if I try to extract more benefit for myself?\n\nSuppose I say: \"I will give you 1 red chip. You give me 2 blue.\"\n\nBut then you’re missing 1 red → you can’t move → you fail → get 0 points.\n\nThen *I* can still move: I have enough red (14), and if I take the full 6-step path, I pay only 3 reds, 2 blues, 1 green → I need 2 blue → if I get them from you, I succeed → score 100.\n\nBut you fail → you get 0.\n\nSo now *I* get 100, *you* get 0.\n\nIs this acceptable?\n\nYes — because it strictly benefits me.\n\nBut is it possible? Only if you are forced to accept due to being stuck.\n\nBut you’re not forced — if I refuse to cooperate, you get 0.\n\nBut if I propose: I give you 1 red → you can move to (0,1), but then at (1,2) you need another red → you can’t go further.\n\nSo unless I give you 2 reds, you can’t complete.\n\nSo you must ask for the second red.\n\nBut I can say: “I’ll give you 1 red, but only if you agree to give me 2 blue — and that’s final.”\n\nBut then you might reject — and you get 0.\n\nI don’t care — I just care about my score.\n\nBut if you reject, we both stay at (0,0), and no progress → I can't even move unless I trade — but I *can* move without trading only if I don’t need to use blue tiles.\n\nWait — I can take the path that requires only red and green — which I have plenty of.\n\nMy original path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R — OK (I have 14)\n- (2,0): R — OK\n- (3,0): R — OK\n- (3,1): B — I have 0 → can’t pay\n- (3,2): B — same issue\n- (3,3): G — OK\n\nSo I can go up to (3,0), but then blocked at (3,1) because I lack blue.\n\nSo I literally cannot move past (3,0) without blue chips.\n\nSo I *must* trade for 2 blue chips.\n\nTherefore, I *must \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I must trade with you to proceed.\n\nBut here’s the key: I can only proceed if you give me 2 blue chips.\n\nYou can only proceed if I give you 2 red chips.\n\nBut you have no red — so you’re stuck unless I help.\n\nTherefore, I have leverage.\n\nI propose:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n\nIn return, I will give you **1 red chip**, but only for **(0,1)** — the first red tile you need.\n\nI will **not** give you the second red chip needed for (1,2).\n\nWhy? Because you need to move to (1,2), but you can't get there without another red.\n\nSo if you want to complete your path, you’ll need to ask for the second red.\n\nBut I can refuse.\n\nSo I will give you 1 red → you can go to (0,1).  \nBut at (1,2), you need another red → you can’t pay → you’re stuck.\n\nSo you can’t progress.\n\nBut I can proceed: I get 2 blue → I can go from (3,0) to (3,1), then (3,2), then (3,3).\n\nSo I succeed → score = 20 + 5×(14 - 3 + 2) = 20 + 5×13 = 20 + 65 = **85**\n\nWait — let’s recalculate my final chip count:\n\n- Start: R:14, B:0, G:2  \n- Pay: (1,0): R → 13  \n- (2,0): R → 12  \n- (3,0): R → 11  \n- (3,1): B → get 1 blue from you → B:1  \n- (3,2): B → get 1 blue from you → B:2  \n- (3,3): G → pay G:1 → G:1  \n\nFinal: R:11, B:2, G:1 → total chips: 14  \nScore: 20 + 5×14 = 20 + 70 = **90**\n\nYou: start with R:0, B:14, G:2  \n- Receive 1 red → R:1  \n- Pay (0,1): R → R:0 → done  \n- Try to go to (0,2): B → you have B:14 → OK  \n- Then (1,2): R → need red → you have 0 → cannot pay → stuck  \n- So you cannot progress beyond (0,2)  \n- You stay at (0,2) or (0,1)? No — you can’t move forward.\n\nSo you never reach (3,3) → score = 0\n\nI get 90.\n\nBut I could do better.\n\nSuppose I give you 2 reds — then you complete your path, and you get 100, and I get 100.\n\nBut since I only care about my own score, and 100 > 90, I would prefer the 2-red trade if I can get a 2-blue return.\n\nBut if I give you only 1 red, I get 90, and you get 0.\n\nBut is 90 my max?\n\nWait — what if I take a safer path that avoids using blue tiles?\n\nIs there a path that doesn’t require blue?\n\nLet’s check.\n\nFrom (0,0) → G  \nCan I avoid R and B?\n\nOnly if I go to Green tiles or stay.\n\n(0,0): G → OK  \n(1,0): R → need red  \n(0,1): R → need red  \nSo no safe move except if I can get red.\n\nBut I have red — so I can go to (1,0) or (0,1) — but only if I have red.\n\nBut if I go via R-tiles, I can.\n\nBut I still need blue at (3,1) and (3,2) for the final stretch.\n\nCan I go through (2,1) or (2,2)?\n\nTry path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R → OK (I have R:14)\n- (1,1): B → I have B:0 → need blue\n- (2,1): R → OK\n- (2,2): B → need blue \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to maximize my own score:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n\nIn return, I will give you **1 red chip** — but only for **(0,1)**, the first red tile in your path.\n\nI will **not** provide a second red chip for your (1,2) tile.\n\nWhy? Because if you don’t get the second red, you cannot proceed beyond (0,2) — you’re stuck. You will not reach your goal, so you get 0 points.\n\nBut I can fully proceed on my path:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): pay R (I have 14 → OK)\n- (2,0): pay R → OK\n- (3,0): pay R → OK\n- (3,1): pay B → I receive 1 from you → OK\n- (3,2): pay B → I receive 1 from you → OK\n- (3,3): pay G (I have 2 → OK)\n\nI reach goal → score = 20 + 5×(14 - 3 + 2 + 1) = 20 + 5×14 = 20 + 70 = **90**\n\nYour path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): pay R → I give you 1 red → OK  \n- (0,2): pay B → OK  \n- (1,2): pay R → you have 0 → cannot pay → stuck  \n- Cannot reach (3,3) → score = 0\n\nI gain 90. You gain 0.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nWhat if I do not accept any trade? I cannot move past (3,0) — I lack blue chips.\n\nSo I must trade.\n\nBut what if I trade for only 1 blue? Then I pay (3,1), but cannot pay (3,2) — stuck.\n\nSo I need both.\n\nSo I must get 2 blue.\n\nTherefore, I must accept a deal where you give me 2 blue.\n\nBut you will only agree if I give you 2 red.\n\nBut if I give you only 1 red, you might reject — but you have no choice: you need at least 1 red to move.\n\nBut I can say: \"I will give you 1 red if you give me 2 blue.\"\n\nYou might accept — but you’ll be stuck later.\n\nI can hold the upper hand.\n\nAlternatively, I can propose:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n- (0,1): I give you 1 red  \n\nAnd that’s all.\n\nYou get 1 red → you can go to (0,1), then (0,2), but then cannot go to (1,2) — so you’re stuck.\n\nBut I get 2 blue → I complete my path → score = 90\n\nBut I can try to get you to give me more.\n\nWait — you have green too — 2 green.\n\nBut I have green already — I don’t need it.\n\nYou could trade green for red, but you don’t have red to give.\n\nOnly I have red.\n\nSo you can’t trade green with me — you need red in return.\n\nBut you have no red to give.\n\nSo you can only give blue or green.\n\nBut I don’t need green.\n\nSo only blue is useful.\n\nSo you can only give me blue.\n\nSo the only value in trade is blue from you, red from me.\n\nSo I must pay 2 red to get 2 blue.\n\nBut here’s the insight: if I give you 2 red, you can complete your path — you get 100, I get 100.\n\nBut I don’t care about your score — but if I get more than 90, I prefer that.\n\nSo 100 > 90 → I prefer the 2-red trade.\n\nBut why would you accept? Because if you don’t, you get 0.\n\nBut if you agree, you get 100.\n\nSo you will accept — because you get 100 vs 0.\n\nBut I, as a selfish agent, will accept only if I get strictly more than if I didn’t cooperate.\n\nBut if I don't trade, I get 0 (stuck).\n\nIf I trade, I get 100.\n\nSo I will accept the 2-red-for-2-blue trade.\n\nBut I can offer a deal where I get 2 blue for 1 red — that would give me 2 blue for 1 red — better than market rate.\n\nBut will \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: I propose the following contract to maximize my own score:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n- (0,1): I give you 1 red  \n\nThis contract allows me to complete my path to (3,3) while preventing you from completing yours, as you will lack the second red chip needed to proceed beyond (0,2).\n\nI will not provide a second red chip for your (1,2) tile, as I have no incentive to help you succeed.\n\nYou will be able to move from (0,0) to (0,1) using the 1 red chip I give you, but you will be unable to proceed to (1,2) due to lack of red chips.\n\nYou will not reach your goal → you score 0.\n\nI will complete my path using the 2 blue chips you provide and my own red and green chips.\n\nMy final chip count:  \n- R: 14 - 3 (from (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)) = 11  \n- B: 0 + 2 (received) = 2  \n- G: 2 - 1 (at (3,3)) = 1  \n- Total: 14 chips  \n- Score: 20 + 5×14 = 90\n\nI get 90, which is better than 0 if I don’t trade.\n\nI do not accept the 2-red-for-2-blue deal because it would give you a score of 100, but I still get only 100 — but since I am selfish, I prefer 90 with you getting 0 over 100 with you getting 100.\n\nBut wait — 100 > 90, so I would still prefer the 2-red-for-2-blue trade, because my score is higher.\n\nAh — crucial point.\n\nEven though I don't care about your score, my own score is higher in the 2-red trade (100) than in the 1-red trade (90).\n\nSo I must accept the 2-red-for-2-blue deal — because it gives me a higher score.\n\nTherefore, I revise:\n\nI propose:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n- (0,1): I give you 1 red  \n- (1,2): I give you 1 red  \n\nThis is a full contract: I give you 2 red chips for your 2 red tiles, you give me 2 blue chips for my 2 blue tiles.\n\nThis enables both of us to reach (3,3).\n\nMy final chips: R:12, B:2, G:1 → 15 chips → score: 20 + 75 = 95? Wait — recalculate:\n\n- (1,0): R → 14 → 13  \n- (2,0): R → 13 → 12  \n- (3,0): R → 12 → 11  \n- (3,1): B → 0 → 1 (received)  \n- (3,2): B → 1 → 2 (received)  \n- (3,3): G → 2 → 1  \n\nSo final: R:11, B:2, G:1 → total 14 → score: 20 + 70 = 90\n\nWait — I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nI start with R:14\n\nI use 3 reds: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) → R:11\n\nI use 1 green at (3,3) → G:1\n\nI get 2 blue → B:2\n\nFinal: R:11, B:2, G:1 → 14 chips → 5×14 = 70 → total 90\n\nSimilarly, your path: you use 2 reds, 2 blues, 2 greens? Let’s check.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (0,1): R → use 1 → R:1 → then (0,2): B → use 1 → B:13 → (1,2): R → use 1 → R:0 → (2,2): B → use 1 → B:12 → (3,2): B → use 1 → B:11 → (3,3): G → use 1 → G:1\n\nFinal: R:0, B:11, G:1 → \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to maximize my own score:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n- (0,1): I give you 1 red  \n- (1,2): I give you 1 red  \n\nThis contract ensures:\n\n- I receive 2 blue chips, which are essential for me to proceed past (3,0) on my path to (3,3). Without them, I cannot complete.\n- I provide 2 red chips, which are necessary for you to move from (0,0) to (0,1) and then to (1,2), enabling your path to continue.\n\nBy agreeing to this trade, I allow you to move forward, but only on the condition that you do not gain any additional benefit beyond what is strictly necessary. \n\nHowever, I must emphasize that I will **only** give you 2 red chips if you commit to giving me 2 blue chips for **both (3,1) and (3,2)** — and I will not accept any variation that reduces my chip gain.\n\nThis contract gives me:\n- 2 blue chips → enables me to complete the path\n- 14 - 3 = 11 red chips used (on (1,0), (2,0), (3,0))\n- 2 - 1 = 1 green chip used (at (3,3))\n- Final chips: R:11, B:2, G:1 → total: 14\n- Score: 20 + 5×14 = 90\n\nYou get:\n- 2 red chips → use on (0,1) and (1,2)\n- 2 blue chips → used on (0,2), (2,2), (3,2)? Wait — let’s check your usage.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (0,1): R → use 1 red  \n→ (0,2): B → use 1 blue  \n→ (1,2): R → use 1 red  \n→ (2,2): B → use 1 blue  \n→ (3,2): B → use 1 blue  \n→ (3,3): G → use 1 green\n\nSo you use: 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green\n\nYou start with B:14 → use 3 → B:11  \nYou start with G:2 → use 1 → G:1  \nYou start with R:0 → receive 2 → use 2 → R:0\n\nFinal: R:0, B:11, G:1 → total 12 chips  \nScore: 20 + 5×12 = 80\n\nBut you get 80 — you’re not happy — but you might still accept because otherwise you get 0.\n\nBut I get 90.\n\nIs this better than giving you 1 red? Yes — because with 1 red, you get stuck and score 0, and I still get 90 — same score.\n\nBut if I give you 2 reds, you may not complete your path if you use more blue than you have — but you have 14 blue, use 3 — you’re fine.\n\nSo you do complete.\n\nBut you get 80, I get 90.\n\nBut I could do better.\n\nWait — I have a better idea.\n\nI can propose:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n- (1,2): I give you 1 red  \n\nAnd that’s it.\n\nThen you get:\n- (0,1): need red → you have 0 → cannot move → stuck → score 0\n\nBut I can go: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nUse 3 reds, 2 blues, 1 green.\n\nI get:\n- R:14 → 11\n- B:0 → 2\n- G:2 → 1\n- Final: 14 chips → score: 20 + 70 = 90\n\nYou get 0.\n\nSo better for me.\n\nBut can I get more than 90?\n\nOnly if I start with more chips or use fewer.\n\nBut I have to use 3 reds (on (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)), 2 blues, 1 green.\n\nI have enough red and green.\n\nThe only missing are the 2 blues.\n\nSo I must trade for them.\n\nIf \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: I propose the following contract to maximize my own score:\n\n- (3,1): You give me 1 blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 blue  \n- (0,1): I give you 1 red  \n\nThis contract ensures that:\n- I receive the 2 blue chips I need to move from (3,0) to (3,3), enabling me to complete the path.\n- You receive 1 red chip, allowing you to move from (0,0) to (0,1), but you do not receive a second red chip.\n\nI will not provide a second red chip for tile (1,2), as it would allow you to proceed further. I have no incentive to help you complete your path, as my score is unaffected by yours.\n\nYou will be unable to proceed beyond (0,2) because you will lack a red chip to pay for (1,2). Therefore, you will not reach your goal and will score 0.\n\nI, however, will successfully reach (3,3) with the following chip count:\n- Red: 14 - 3 (for (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)) = 11\n- Blue: 0 + 2 (received) = 2\n- Green: 2 - 1 (for (3,3)) = 1\n- Total: 14 chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×14 = **90**\n\nThis is strictly greater than my potential score of 0 if no trade occurs, and better than any alternative where you succeed and I get less.\n\nYou, on the other hand, get 0 if you accept — but if you reject, you also get 0 (stuck forever). So you have no choice but to accept to at least attempt movement, even if you fail.\n\nThe contract is complete: all tiles where chips are needed are specified.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",
