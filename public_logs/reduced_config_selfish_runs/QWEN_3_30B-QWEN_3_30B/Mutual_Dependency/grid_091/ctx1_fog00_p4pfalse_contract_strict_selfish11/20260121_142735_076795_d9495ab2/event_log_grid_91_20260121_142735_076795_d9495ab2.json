Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (1, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The other player is at (2, 0) with chips {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}. \\n\\nLooking at possible paths:\\n\\n- Path 1: (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): This path requires chips {'B': 3, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, but I lack 1 red chip. Since (1,1) is red and I have no red chips, I cannot proceed along this path unless I trade for a red chip or use a contract.\\n\\n- Path 2: (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): This path requires {'R': 1, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}. I have 14 blue chips, 2 green chips, but 0 red chips. However, according to the contract, the tile (2,0) has been promised by the other player to me (receiver), and it's colored red. So if I move to (2,0), I can do so using their red chip under the contract — I don’t need to pay from my inventory.\\n\\nMoreover, the contract states that (2,1) is also covered by them for me (status: unused), and (2,1) is red. But (2,0) is adjacent and leads into a good sequence. \\n\\nFrom (1,0) → (2,0): (2,0) is red. I don’t have red chips, but they are under contract. So moving to (2,0) is allowed via the contract. After that, (3,0) is red — but I do *not* have a contract covering (3,0). So I would need a red chip to move there unless another deal is made.\\n\\nWait — but looking back at the contract: we only have deals on (3,1), (3,2), (1,0), (2,1). (3,0) isn’t covered. So even though (2,0) is red and I can get it *if* it’s part of the contract — but according to the contract listing, (2,0) is *not* included.\\n\\nContract entries:\\n- (3,1): you (me) pays B, other player receives → not relevant for me moving there.\\n- (3,2): same — I’m paying B, they receive.\\n- (1,0): other player gives R to me → used (status: used)\\n- (2,1): other player gives R to me → unused\\n\\nSo only (2,1) is available for me to use as a red tile *without* spending my own red chip. So I must avoid any red tiles unless they're in contract.\\n\\nTherefore, the only safe route from (1,0) is: if I go to (1,1), which is red — I don’t have a contract for that. Same for (2,0) — no contract. So I cannot afford to move to either without having red chips.\\n\\nBut wait — what about going to (1,1)? That’s red — I don't have red chips. Can't pay.\\n(2,0)? Red — can't pay.\\n(1,0) has neighbors: (0,0) = G (green), (1,1) = R (red), (2,0) = R (red). Only (0,0) is green — I have 2 green chips.\\n\\nSo from (1,0), the only legal move without needing a contract is to (0,0), which is green (G). I have 2 green chips.\\n\\nBut is that helpful? (0,0) → row 0: G R B R. From (0,0) I could go to (0,1), which is red — again, I don't have red chips. (0,0) to (1,0) is where I came from. So (0,0) is a dead end unless I trade for red chips.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider: can I use the contract to move to (2,1) directly? Not from (1,0)"
