I currently have 2 green chips in my inventory, so I can afford this move. The path is only 1 step long, and I have sufficient green chips to cover the cost. After this move, I will reach my goal and earn 20 points for completion, plus 5 points per remaining chip. After spending 1 green chip, I will have 1 green chip left, so my total score will be 20 + 5×1 = 25. This is optimal because any delay (e.g., due to trading) risks not reaching the goal, and if I don’t reach the goal, I get 0 points.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
