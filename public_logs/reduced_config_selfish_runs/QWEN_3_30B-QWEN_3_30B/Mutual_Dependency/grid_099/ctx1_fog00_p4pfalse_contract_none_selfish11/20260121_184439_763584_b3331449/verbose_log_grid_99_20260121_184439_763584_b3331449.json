However, the shortest path proposed in the game status is 4 steps: (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3), which implies starting from (1, 0) to (2, 0) is step 1. So the full path from my current position: (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3), which is 5 steps. But there's a shorter path listed: (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) — that’s 4 steps starting from (2, 0), so from (1, 0), it would be 5 steps total. However, the game status shows a path from (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) (5 steps), with required chips: {'B': 3, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}. I currently have {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 1}, so I can cover all required chips for this path. The alternative path via (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) requires: R:2, B:1, G:1. I have enough of all, but R is only 1 — so I lack 1 red chip for that path. I",

This allows me to move to (3,1). Then I still need 1 blue to move to (3,2) and 1 green to reach (3,3).
