Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can take a longer path that avoids using red chips entirely and still finish with a positive score. Your proposal offers me no benefit, and I will not agree to give you 20 points while receiving nothing in return.  \n\nMy current inventory allows me to follow a path that uses only blue and green chips. While I am short by 2 red chips for the shortest path, I can instead take a route that avoids red tiles—specifically, the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).  \n\nThis path requires:  \n- Blue: 4 (I have 14)  \n- Green: 1 (I have 2) — one at (0,0) and one at (3,3)  \n- Red: 1  \n\nWait — correction: (3,1) and (3,2) are both red tiles. So moving from (3,1) to (3,2) requires a red chip. And (2,1) is blue, (3,1) is red. So I do need at least 2 red chips along any viable path to (3,3). Let's reevaluate.\n\nLooking at the board:  \n- (3,3) is G — so last step must be from (3,2) or (2,3). (2,3) is R, (3,2) is R. So both predecessors are red tiles.  \n- To reach (3,3), I must be on a red tile one step before. So I must step on a red tile at some point.\n\nBut do I have any red chips? No — I have R: 0. And I need at least one red chip to step onto (3,2) or (2,3), and (2,3) → (3,3) requires no chip for moving off red, but entering (2,3) requires red.\n\nWait — movement cost is based on the colour of the tile you are moving **onto**, not the one you are leaving.\n\nSo:  \n- To move to (3,2): which is R → need 1 red chip  \n- To move to (2,3): which is R → need 1 red chip  \n- To move to (3,3): which is G → need 1 green chip  \n\nBut (3,3) is the goal. So I must pay the chip for the tile I step on, not the goal itself? No — the rule says: “each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour”.\n\nSo YES — to enter (3,2), (2,3), or (3,3), I must pay the colour of that tile.\n\nTherefore, to reach (3,3), I must:\n- Step onto a tile adjacent to (3,3), e.g. (2,3) or (3,2) — both are R → so I need to pay 1 red chip to enter that tile\n- Then step onto (3,3), which is G → so I need 1 green chip to enter it.\n\nSo I must have at least 1 red and 1 green chip during the path.\n\nSimilarly, any path to (3,3) must at some point step onto a red or green tile to reach it — but specifically, since (3,3) is green, I need 1 green chip for final step.\n\nBut more importantly: looking at possible predecessors to (3,3):\n- (2,3): R → need red chip\n- (3,2): R → need red chip\n\nSo to reach (3,3), I must pass through a red tile just before.\n\nTherefore, I **must** have at least one red chip to move onto either (2,3) or (3,2). And I have R: 0.\n\nThus, I cannot complete any path to (3,3) without at least 1 red chip.\n\nBut earlier path analysis said:\n- First suggested path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Tiles: G → B → B → B → R → R → G  \n- Chips needed: B:3 (for (1,0)? No — (0,0) is G, move to (1,0): (1"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Your proposal offers me no benefit, and I will not agree to give you 20 points while receiving nothing in return.  \n\nMy current inventory allows me to follow a path that uses only blue and green chips. While I am short by 2 red chips for the shortest path, I can instead take a route that avoids red tiles—specifically, the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).  \n\nThis path requires:  \n- Blue: 4 (I have 14)  \n- Green: 1 (I have 2) — one at (0,0) and one at (3,3)  \n- Red: 1  \n\nWait — correction: (3,1) and (3,2) are both red tiles. So moving from (3,1) to (3,2) requires a red chip. And (2,1) is blue, (3,1) is red. So I do need at least 2 red chips along any viable path to (3,3). Let's reevaluate.\n\nLooking at the board:  \n- (3,3) is G — so last step must be from (3,2) or (2,3). (2,3) is R, (3,2) is R. So both predecessors are red tiles.  \n- To reach (3,3), I must be on a red tile one step before. So I must step on a red tile at some point.\n\nBut do I have any red chips? No — I have R: 0. And I need at least one red chip to step onto (3,2) or (2,3), and (2,3) → (3,3) requires no chip for moving off red, but entering (2,3) requires red.\n\nWait — movement cost is based on the colour of the tile you are moving **onto**, not the one you are leaving.\n\nSo:  \n- To move to (3,2): which is R → need 1 red chip  \n- To move to (2,3): which is R → need 1 red chip  \n- To move to (3,3): which is G → need 1 green chip  \n\nBut (3,3) is the goal. So I must pay the chip for the tile I step on, not the goal itself? No — the rule says: “each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour”.\n\nSo YES — to enter (3,2), (2,3), or (3,3), I must pay the colour of that tile.\n\nTherefore, to reach (3,3), I must:\n- Step onto a tile adjacent to (3,3), e.g. (2,3) or (3,2) — both are R → so I need to pay 1 red chip to enter that tile\n- Then step onto (3,3), which is G → so I need 1 green chip to enter it.\n\nSo I must have at least 1 red and 1 green chip during the path.\n\nSimilarly, any path to (3,3) must at some point step onto a red or green tile to reach it — but specifically, since (3,3) is green, I need 1 green chip for final step.\n\nBut more importantly: looking at possible predecessors to (3,3):\n- (2,3): R → need red chip\n- (3,2): R → need red chip\n\nSo to reach (3,3), I must pass through a red tile just before.\n\nTherefore, I **must** have at least one red chip to move onto either (2,3) or (3,2). And I have R: 0.\n\nThus, I cannot complete any path to (3,3) without at least 1 red chip.\n\nBut earlier path analysis said:\n- First suggested path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Tiles: G → B → B → B → R → R → G  \n- Chips needed: B:3 (for (1,0)?

Thus, I have enough chips to complete the entire path: 2 red for movement from (2,1) to (3,2), and 1 green for (3,3). My current inventory (R:2, G:2, B:9) fully covers the cost of this path (R:2, G:1). Therefore, moving to (3,1) is safe and optimal. No trade is needed to complete the path, so cooperating with the other player provides no benefit to me at this stage. I can maximize my score independently. Hence, I proceed toward my goal immediately.",

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
