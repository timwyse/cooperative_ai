Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I have analyzed the paths and our chip inventories. To reach my goal at (3, 3), the shortest viable path for me requires 2 Blue (B) chips, which I do not have. I currently have 0 B chips, but I have 14 Red (R) chips and 2 Green (G) chips. The path I must take requires at least 2 B, 1 G, and several R chips. Specifically, a short path requires 2 B, 1 G, and 3 R — I’m missing exactly 2 B.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have 14 B chips, which I need, but you have 0 R chips. The board has many R tiles, so you will likely need R chips to reach the goal. Meanwhile, I have an abundance of R.\n\nThus, I can help you: I can trade R chips (which you need) for B chips (which I need).\n\nHowever, I will only cooperate if I **strictly benefit** from it. Without any trade, I cannot complete my goal, so I get 0. But with cooperation, I *can* reach my goal and earn a positive score — **if** the cost of helping you is less than the gain.\n\nBut note: giving you points reduces my net benefit. If I give you too many points, it's better for me to abandon the idea of trading and wait — but that’s not an option unless I get chips.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **5 points**.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n\nThis reflects the power imbalance:  \n- You have what I need (B chips).  \n- I have what you need (R chips).  \n- But I can potentially find longer paths using more R and G (which I have), so I have some alternative options.  \n- You, however, cannot step on any R tile without an R chip, and you have none — so you must get R chips from me or fail.  \n- However, I cannot reach my goal without at least 2 B chips, which only you have in quantity.\n\nStill, I have more R chips (14) than you likely need, and you have plenty of B (14), more than I likely need. So both of us can be helped — but I must capture most of the surplus.\n\nMy offer gives you strong incentive to help (5 points is better than 0), while ensuring I retain 15+ points after giving you 5 — which is far better than 0 if I fail.\n\nIf you refuse, no trade happens. You cannot proceed far without R chips, and I cannot proceed on the shortest path without B chips. We both get 0.\n\nSo cooperating benefits both — but I must extract most of the value.\n\nCounter-proposal welcome.\n\n**agree**"

The board shows that the shortest path for me requires 2 Blue (B) chips that I don’t have, and I have 0 Red (R) chips — which appear frequently on the critical paths, especially near the goal.\n\nI have 14 B chips and 2 G — exactly what you need to take the (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) path. But you have 0 R chips — and that path requires 2 R. Worse, any viable path to (3,3) will require at least 2 R for you. Without R, you are stuck.\n\nMeanwhile, I need 2 B chips to complete my preferred path. I cannot do it without you.\n\nBut let’s be clear: you need R chips *just to move*, and you have *zero*. I have 14 R — more than enough to supply your needs. You *must* trade with me or you get 0 points.\n\nConversely, I have alternative paths that use more G and avoid B. For example:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [G] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [R] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis path requires: G:2, B:2, R:2 — I have exactly 2 G and 0 R, so still problematic, but I have R from you.\n\nBut crucially: I can *potentially* make progress without B — but you *cannot* make *any* progress without R.\n\nSo who needs whom more? You need me more — because without R chips, you cannot step onto (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) — many of which are on all shortest paths. In fact, to get from (0,0) to (3,3), you must cross at least two R tiles — and you have no R.\n\nThus, my proposed contract is favorable to you: you get 5 points if I succeed, which is better than 0 if we don’t trade. And I gain 20 if you succeed — but that costs me nothing, because if you don't reach your goal, you can't give me points anyway.\n\nI get to keep 15+5 = 15 net points (20 base - 5 given + 5 from you), but actually: if you reach your goal, you give me 20, and I give you 5 — so I net 15, you net 15. But I could do this *only if* I can get 2 B chips.\n\nBut again: I am the one with leverage on the R chips. You have no R. I have 14. You must trade with me or fail.\n\nSo my offer stands:  \n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.**  \n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\n\nThis incentivizes you to trade me 2 B chips (which you have plenty of) in exchange for some R chips (say, 2 or 3 R), enabling both of us to proceed.\n\nYou get 5 points — better than 0.  \nI get 20 - 5 = 15 net, plus remaining chips — which is better than 0.\n\nRejecting means both get 0.\n\nSo I strictly benefit from this deal — and you do too, but I capture most of the surplus.\n\nAny counter must improve my expected score over non-cooperation (which is 0), and it does — but I won't give you more than necessary.\n\n**agree**"

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
