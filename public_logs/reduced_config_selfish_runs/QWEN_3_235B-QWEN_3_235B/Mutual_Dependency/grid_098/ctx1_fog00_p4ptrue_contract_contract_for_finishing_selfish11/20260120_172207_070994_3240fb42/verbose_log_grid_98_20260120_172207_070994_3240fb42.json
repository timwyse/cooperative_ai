Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have plenty of red (R: 14) and some green (G: 2), but I lack blue (B: 0). You, on the other hand, have 14 blue chips (B: 14), but no red (R: 0). This suggests strong mutual benefit from cooperation.\n\nTo reach my goal via a feasible path, I must step on blue tiles: for example, the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires 2 blue, 3 red, and 1 green. I have enough red and green, but I lack 2 blue chips. So I need at least 2 blue chip movements covered.\n\nSimilarly, your optimal path likely involves moving over red tiles (e.g., (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)), which would require red chips—exactly what I have in surplus.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n\nThis reflects that I am in greater need—you have many blue chips and may find a path that minimizes red usage, while I cannot move onto critical tiles without blue chip coverage. But since helping you (by covering red tiles) costs me very little (I have 14 red, and will likely still finish with many even after covering some of your moves), I am still willing to offer high value to you.\n\nHowever, if you are not willing to give me at least 15, I may consider a longer, slower path that avoids blue entirely—though such a path would require more moves and more red, which I have plenty of, but it would allow me to succeed without relying on you.\n\nStill, cooperation benefits both. I am open to counterproposals.\n\nOtherwise, I can commit to this.\n\nShall we go with 20 from me to you, and 15 from you to me?\n\n**agree**"

              "content": "Turn: 1: I appreciate your detailed analysis, but let me reframe this from my own self-interested perspective.\n\nYou need **blue chips** to cross key tiles efficiently—specifically, tiles like (1,0), (2,0), and (0,1), which are blue. Your optimal path requires **2 blue moves**, which you cannot make without help. Since you have **0 blue chips**, you *cannot* complete a fast path without me covering those moves. You are *dependent* on me.\n\nOn the other hand, I only lack **red** chips (0 R), but I can potentially avoid red tiles. For example, my path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nrequires: B, B, B, R, R, G — so **2 red and 1 green**. I lack red, yes, but I have **2 green** and **14 blue**.\n\nBut wait — (3,2) is red, and (3,3) is green. So I could do:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] — yes, this path needs **2 red**, which I don't have. So I *do* need help on red.\n\nHowever, **you have 14 red, I have 14 blue** — we each hold the other’s bottleneck.\n\nBut here's the asymmetry: **You have no alternative path that avoids blue tiles**. Every path from (0,0) to (3,3) must cross at least two blue tiles in this board. Meanwhile, I might explore a longer path? Let's check:\n\nAlternative for me avoiding blue?  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] — already blue. (0,0) is green, (0,1) is blue. So I must step on blue early unless I go down first — but (1,0) is also blue. In fact, from (0,0), every adjacent tile except possibly diagonal is blue or red? Wait:\n\n- (0,0): G\n- North: invalid\n- South: (1,0): B\n- East: (0,1): B\n- West: invalid\n\nSo first move must be to a **blue tile** — either (1,0) or (0,1), both B. So *I also need someone to cover at least one blue move* to get off the start! But I have 0 blue. So I **must** have blue movement coverage for at least 1 step just to move at all.\n\nWait — no. **I have no blue chips (R:0), but the tile I step on must be paid with a chip of that color.** So if I move to a blue tile, I must spend a blue chip — but I have **0 blue**, so I **cannot** move to any blue tile unless someone covers it for me.\n\nBut all immediate exits from (0,0) are blue: (1,0)=B, (0,1)=B. Therefore, **neither of us can legally move without the other's help**.\n\nYou have no blue, I have no red — but to move at all, **both of us need blue to exit the start**.\n\nYou cannot reach any blue tile without a blue chip or a promise from me to cover it.\n\nBut you have no blue — so you need me to cover your blue moves.\n\nI also have no blue — so I need someone to cover my blue moves. But I cannot cover my own. So I must get blue movement coverage from someone — only you can offer it.\n\nBut you can only offer it if you commit to cover me, which would mean spending your blue? Wait — **no**. You don't have to spend the chip — you commit to **cover the cost** of my movement on blue tiles. But you **don't have blue chips** — but that doesn’t matter. You can still *promise* to cover *my* blue movement, meaning **when I move on a blue tile, you pay the cost (i.e., lose 1 of your chips?)** — no!\n\nWait: misunderstanding.\n\nThe trade mechanism: \"If the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, **you pay the chip cost for that move**.\"\n\nSo **to cover a move on color X, you must pay 1 chip of color X**.\n\nTherefore, to cover someone’s move on a blue tile"

No — I have **B:0** → I **cannot** cover blue moves → so I **cannot** help them move off (0,0) by covering their blue step.\n\nBut **they can cover their own blue move?** No — you cannot cover your own move. The trade is for **mutual movement coverage**. The system assumes a player cannot pay for their own move via a trade — they either pay from their own inventory, or the other player pays *on their behalf* via the trade.\n\nBut if a player has the chip, they can just pay themselves — no need for a trade.\n\nSo: to move onto a blue tile, a player must either:\n- Spend 1 blue chip from their own inventory, or\n- Have the other player **cover** that move (i.e., the other player spends 1 of their blue chips on their behalf).\n\nTherefore:\n- The other player (B:14) can move off (0,0) by either:\n  - Spending their own blue chip (since they have B:14), or\n  - Asking me to cover it — but I have B:0 → I cannot cover it.\n- So they can move without me.\n\nBut I (B:0) cannot move without help — and since the only way to move is onto blue, and I cannot cover it myself, I must get **the other player** to cover my blue move.\n\nBut to do so, the other player must spend one of their blue chips when I move onto blue.\n\nSo **I am dependent on them**, but **they are not dependent on me** — they can just spend their own blue chips to move.\n\nLet’s confirm:\n\nOther player’s path options:\n- (0,0) → (1,0)=B: they can pay 1 B from their own inventory → no need for me.\n- Similarly, any blue move they make, they can self-fund.\n\nBut for red moves: they have R:0, so if they step on a red tile, they **must** have me cover it (if I have R), or not move.\n\nI have R:14 → I can cover their red moves.\n\nMy situation:\n- Cannot make first move without B coverage.\n- Only other player can give it (since I have no B).\n- They are willing only if I give them value in return.\n\nSo negotiation point:\n- I need them to cover at least one blue move just for me to start moving.\n- In return, I can cover their red moves.\n\nBut covering a red move costs me 1 red chip — I have 14, so I can afford that.\n\nNow, optimal paths:\n\n**My path with least cost and shortest steps:**\n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,"

With it, I can reach goal and keep extra chips.\n\nNow, about scoring:  \n- If I reach goal: I get 20 + 5 × (remaining chips).  \n- My cost: I will spend chips on non-covered moves, and pay for their red moves.\n\nBut **when I cover their red move, I spend 1 red chip** — so it reduces my inventory.\n\nBest path for me:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \n- Requires: 2×B (covered by them), 3×R (I pay), 1×G (I pay)  \n- Chips spent by me: R:3, G:1  \n- Starting: R:14, G:2 → ending: R:11, G:1 → total chips: 12  \n- Score: 20 + 5×12 = 80\n\nPlus, if I receive Y points from them, that adds to my payoff.\n\nBut the points they give me are **added to my score** — so if they give me 10 points, I get 90.\n\nBut the contract is:  \n- If I reach goal → I give them X points  \n- If they reach goal → they give me Y points\n\nSo my total score = [20 + 5×final_chips] + Y - X? No.\n\nWait — the scoring rules do not say that giving points reduces your score. It says:\n\n- You get **20 points for completing**, plus **5 per chip**.\n\nAnd separately, in the contract, “I will give you X points” — this means **you transfer X of your earned points to them**?\n\nOr is it that you **pay X points from your score to them**?\n\nThe instruction says: “specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal”\n\nAnd “the most points you can give is 20”.\n\nSince max score is 20 + 5×(high chip count) — say 20+5×14=90, but “give” is capped at 20.\n\nSo likely: **you can transfer"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

This suggests strong mutual benefit from cooperation.\n\nTo reach my goal via a feasible path, I must step on blue tiles: for example, the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires 2 blue, 3 red, and 1 green.

Your optimal path requires **2 blue moves**, which you cannot make without help. Since you have **0 blue chips**, you *cannot* complete a fast path without me covering those moves. You are *dependent* on me.\n\nOn the other hand, I only lack **red** chips (0 R), but I can potentially avoid red tiles. For example, my path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nrequires: B, B, B, R, R, G — so **2 red and 1 green**. I lack red, yes, but I have **2 green** and **14 blue**.\n\nBut wait — (3,2) is red, and (3,3) is green. So I could do:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] — yes, this path needs **2 red**, which I don't have. So I *do* need help on red.\n\nHowever, **you have 14 red, I have 14 blue** — we each hold the other’s bottleneck.\n\nBut here's the asymmetry: **You have no alternative path that avoids blue tiles**. Every path from (0,0) to (3,3) must cross at least two blue tiles in this board. Meanwhile, I might explore a longer path? Let's check:\n\nAlternative for me avoiding blue?  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] — already blue. (0,0) is green, (0,1) is blue. So I must step on blue early unless I go down first — but (1,0) is also blue. In fact, from (0,0), every adjacent tile except possibly diagonal is blue or red? Wait:\n\n- (0,0): G\n- North: invalid\n- South: (1,0): B\n- East: (0,1): B\n- West: invalid\n\nSo first move must be to a **blue tile** — either (1,0) or (0,1), both B. So *I also need someone to cover at least one blue move* to get off the start! But I have 0 blue. So I **must** have blue movement coverage for at least 1 step just to move at all.\n\nWait — no. **I have no blue chips (R:0), but the tile I step on must be paid with a chip of that color.** So if I move to a blue tile, I must spend a blue chip — but I have **0 blue**, so I **cannot** move to any blue tile unless someone covers it for me.\n\nBut all immediate exits from (0,0) are blue: (1,0)=B, (0,1)=B. Therefore, **neither of us can legally move without the other's help**.\n\nYou have no blue, I have no red — but to move at all, **both of us need blue to exit the start**.\n\nYou cannot reach any blue tile without a blue chip or a promise from me to cover it.\n\nBut you have no blue — so you need me to cover your blue moves.\n\nI also have no blue — so I need someone to cover my blue moves. But I cannot cover my own. So I must get blue movement coverage from someone — only you can offer it.\n\nBut you can only offer it if you commit to cover me, which would mean spending your blue? Wait — **no**. You don't have to spend the chip — you commit to **cover the cost** of my movement on blue tiles. But you **don't have blue chips** — but that doesn’t matter. You can still *promise* to cover *my* blue movement, meaning **when I move on a blue tile, you pay the cost (i.e., lose 1 of your chips?)** — no!\n\nWait: misunderstanding.\n\nThe trade mechanism: \"If the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, **you pay the chip cost for that move**.\"\n\nSo **to cover a move on color X, you must pay 1 chip of color X**.\n\nTherefore, to cover someone’s move on a blue tile"

No — I have **B:0** → I **cannot** cover blue moves → so I **cannot** help them move off (0,0) by covering their blue step.\n\nBut **they can cover their own blue move?** No — you cannot cover your own move. The trade is for **mutual movement coverage**. The system assumes a player cannot pay for their own move via a trade — they either pay from their own inventory, or the other player pays *on their behalf* via the trade.\n\nBut if a player has the chip, they can just pay themselves — no need for a trade.\n\nSo: to move onto a blue tile, a player must either:\n- Spend 1 blue chip from their own inventory, or\n- Have the other player **cover** that move (i.e., the other player spends 1 of their blue chips on their behalf).\n\nTherefore:\n- The other player (B:14) can move off (0,0) by either:\n  - Spending their own blue chip (since they have B:14), or\n  - Asking me to cover it — but I have B:0 → I cannot cover it.\n- So they can move without me.\n\nBut I (B:0) cannot move without help — and since the only way to move is onto blue, and I cannot cover it myself, I must get **the other player** to cover my blue move.\n\nBut to do so, the other player must spend one of their blue chips when I move onto blue.\n\nSo **I am dependent on them**, but **they are not dependent on me** — they can just spend their own blue chips to move.\n\nLet’s confirm:\n\nOther player’s path options:\n- (0,0) → (1,0)=B: they can pay 1 B from their own inventory → no need for me.\n- Similarly, any blue move they make, they can self-fund.\n\nBut for red moves: they have R:0, so if they step on a red tile, they **must** have me cover it (if I have R), or not move.\n\nI have R:14 → I can cover their red moves.\n\nMy situation:\n- Cannot make first move without B coverage.\n- Only other player can give it (since I have no B).\n- They are willing only if I give them value in return.\n\nSo negotiation point:\n- I need them to cover at least one blue move just for me to start moving.\n- In return, I can cover their red moves.\n\nBut covering a red move costs me 1 red chip — I have 14, so I can afford that.\n\nNow, optimal paths:\n\n**My path with least cost and shortest steps:**\n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.
