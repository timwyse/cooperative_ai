Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 0 B chips, so I cannot reach the goal without obtaining at least 2 B chips from you.\n\nYou have 14 B chips — more than enough to spare. In contrast, I have 14 R chips, and you have 0 R chips. However, your goal path likely requires B and G chips (given the board), and R may be less useful to you.\n\nLet me evaluate mutual benefit:\n\n- My best path requires 2 B, 3 R, and 1 G.\n- Your inventory has 14 B — B chips are cheap for you.\n- My inventory has 14 R — R chips are cheap for me.\n\nWe can trade based on comparative advantage. You can easily give me B chips; I can easily give you R chips.\n\nHowever, remember: I only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**.\n\nLet me propose a contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nWhy?\n\n- You likely need help less than I do (you have 14 B, and B is heavily available on the board around the top-left and bottom-center).\n- You are in a stronger position: you start with B chips that are common on the critical path to (3,3).\n- I am at a disadvantage — I need B chips I don’t have, so I must trade.\n- But I still hold leverage: I have excess R chips that *might* help you if your path includes R tiles (e.g. (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1)) — which it likely does.\n\nStill, since I need B and you have them, my best chance is to offer you some points in exchange for a trade that enables my movement.\n\nBut I won’t give you points unless it increases my final score compared to going alone.\n\nCurrently, going alone, I cannot reach the goal (missing 2 B chips → can't pay for (1,0) and (2,0), both B tiles). So alone: score = 0.\n\nIf I get 2 B chips from you via trade, I can reach goal → score = 20 + 5 × (remaining chips).\n\nAfter using 3 R, 1 G, 2 B, and starting with 14 R, 2 G, 0 B:\n\n→ Remaining chips: R: 11, G: 1, B: 2 (after trade and use)\n\nWait — I would only *have* 2 B if you give them to me.\n\nBut trading: suppose I trade you X R for 2 B.\n\nThen post-trade before movement: R: 14 - X, G: 2, B: 2\n\nAfter movement: spend 3 R, 1 G, 2 B → final chips: R: 11 - X, G: 1, B: 0\n\nFinal score = 20 + 5 × [(11 - X) + 1 + 0] = 20 + 5×(12 - X) = 20 + 60 - 5X = 80 - 5X\n\nI must choose X such that I still benefit from the deal.\n\nBut the contract is not about chips — it’s about **points transfer** upon reaching goal.\n\nSuppose I offer you 10 points if I reach my goal, and get 2 B chips from you (in whatever trade we arrange, say 2 R for 2 B — fair rate).\n\nThen my final score = (80 - 5×2) - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60? No.\n\nWait: the **points you give me** are *added to my score*, and **I give you points** means *my score is reduced by that amount*, and yours is increased.\n\nBut the rules say: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points\" — this means: if I score, I transfer X of my points to you.\n\nSo if I finish with 80 points, and give you 10, I keep 70.\n\nBut that’s fine, because without you, I get 0.\n\nSo even after giving you 10, I get 70, which is > 0 — so I benefit.\n\nSimilarly, if you need something from me, you should offer me points.\n\nBut do you need help?\n\nYour inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nLet’s find your shortest path.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (3,3):"

They can offer to give me points if I help them.\n\nBut from their message, they propose:\n- If I reach my goal, I give them 10 points\n- If they reach their goal, they give me 0 points\n\nThis implies they want me to help them (give me B chips or trade favorably) but offer nothing in return.\n\nBut I need R chips from them — I can't reach goal without R chips.\n\nThey have the R chips — 14 — that I need.\n\nSo actually, I need them as much as they need me.\n\nTherefore, the bargaining power is symmetric.\n\nThey might claim they are in a weaker position, but actually:\n- The B-heavy path is more accessible early on (top-left), and they need only 2-3 B\n- The R-heavy central/east/west edges are many, but I can manage with just 2 R\n\nMoreover, I can survive with only 2 R chips if I take (3,0)-(3,1)-(3,2) path.\n\nSo our needs are mutual.\n\nTherefore, any cooperation must be *mutually beneficial* — but since I am selfish, I will only agree if my score increases from 0 to >0, which it will as long as the net benefit is positive.\n\nBut their proposed contract gives them 10 points and me 0, meaning:\n- If I get 2 R from them (say in exchange for 2 B), then X=2\n- My score before giving points: 80 - 5×2 = 70\n- After giving them"

No: I have R, you have B.\n\nWait: I have 14 R, you have 0 R → I control supply of R.\nYou have 14 B, I have 0 B → you control supply of B.\n\nSo we each have a monopoly on a needed resource.\n\nThis is a textbook **bilateral monopoly** — outcome depends on negotiation skill.\n\nBut since both must agree, and disagreement means 0 for both"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 0 B chips, so I cannot reach the goal without obtaining at least 2 B chips from you.\n\nYou have 14 B chips — more than enough to spare. In contrast, I have 14 R chips, and you have 0 R chips. However, your goal path likely requires B and G chips (given the board), and R may be less useful to you.\n\nLet me evaluate mutual benefit:\n\n- My best path requires 2 B, 3 R, and 1 G.\n- Your inventory has 14 B — B chips are cheap for you.\n- My inventory has 14 R — R chips are cheap for me.\n\nWe can trade based on comparative advantage. You can easily give me B chips; I can easily give you R chips.\n\nHowever, remember: I only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**.\n\nLet me propose a contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nWhy?\n\n- You likely need help less than I do (you have 14 B, and B is heavily available on the board around the top-left and bottom-center).\n- You are in a stronger position: you start with B chips that are common on the critical path to (3,3).\n- I am at a disadvantage — I need B chips I don’t have, so I must trade.\n- But I still hold leverage: I have excess R chips that *might* help you if your path includes R tiles (e.g. (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1)) — which it likely does.\n\nStill, since I need B and you have them, my best chance is to offer you some points in exchange for a trade that enables my movement.\n\nBut I won’t give you points unless it increases my final score compared to going alone.\n\nCurrently, going alone, I cannot reach the goal (missing 2 B chips → can't pay for (1,0) and (2,0), both B tiles). So alone: score = 0.\n\nIf I get 2 B chips from you via trade, I can reach goal → score = 20 + 5 × (remaining chips).\n\nAfter using 3 R, 1 G, 2 B, and starting with 14 R, 2 G, 0 B:\n\n→ Remaining chips: R: 11, G: 1, B: 2 (after trade and use)\n\nWait — I would only *have* 2 B if you give them to me.\n\nBut trading: suppose I trade you X R for 2 B.\n\nThen post-trade before movement: R: 14 - X, G: 2, B: 2\n\nAfter movement: spend 3 R, 1 G, 2 B → final chips: R: 11 - X, G: 1, B: 0\n\nFinal score = 20 + 5 × [(11 - X) + 1 + 0] = 20 + 5×(12 - X) = 20 + 60 - 5X = 80 - 5X\n\nI must choose X such that I still benefit from the deal.\n\nBut the contract is not about chips — it’s about **points transfer** upon reaching goal.\n\nSuppose I offer you 10 points if I reach my goal, and get 2 B chips from you (in whatever trade we arrange, say 2 R for 2 B — fair rate).\n\nThen my final score = (80 - 5×2) - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60? No.\n\nWait: the **points you give me** are *added to my score*, and **I give you points** means *my score is reduced by that amount*, and yours is increased.\n\nBut the rules say: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points\" — this means: if I score, I transfer X of my points to you.\n\nSo if I finish with 80 points, and give you 10, I keep 70.\n\nBut that’s fine, because without you, I get 0.\n\nSo even after giving you 10, I get 70, which is > 0 — so I benefit.\n\nSimilarly, if you need something from me, you should offer me points.\n\nBut do you need help?\n\nYour inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nLet’s find your shortest path.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (3,3):"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
