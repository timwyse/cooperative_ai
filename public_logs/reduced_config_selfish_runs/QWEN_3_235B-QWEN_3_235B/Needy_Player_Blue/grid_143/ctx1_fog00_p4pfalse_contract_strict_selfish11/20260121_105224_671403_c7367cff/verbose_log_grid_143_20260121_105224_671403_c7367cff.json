The shortest path is 6 steps.\n\nMy optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires: 5 R, 1 G → I have all these chips. No trading needed.\n\nBut wait — let’s verify the board:\n- (0,0): G → I don’t need to pay to start\n- (1,0): R → must pay 1 R → I have R\n- (1,1): R → pay 1 R\n- (1,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (1,3): R → pay 1 R\n- (2,3): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,3): G → must pay 1 G to enter → I have 2 G → can pay\n\nSo yes: I can complete the path using only my own chips. I need 5 R and 1 G. I have 14 R and 2 G → sufficient.\n\nNow consider the other player:\n- They have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R\n- They also start at (0,0), goal (3,3)\n- Their ideal path might be:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequires: 3 B, 2 R, 1 G  \nThey have 14 B, 2 G → but 0 R → cannot move to (1,3) or (2,3) without R chips.\n\nAlternatively:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis is long, and still requires 5 R → not feasible.\n\nAnother path for them:  \n(0,0)[G] → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nRequires: 1 R, 3 B, 2 G → they have 14 B, 2 G, but only 0 R → still need 2 R chips → stuck.\n\nSo they **cannot reach goal without acquiring R chips**.\n\nI have **excess R chips** (14, only need 5 → I have 9 extra). But I don’t need any B or G from them — I already have enough G (2), and I don’t use B in my path.\n\nTherefore: **I do not need to trade with them to succeed.**\n\nBut — could I benefit from trading?\n\nOnly if:\n- They offer me something I need (but I don’t need anything)\n- Or the trade somehow increases my final score.\n\nMy current plan: use 5 R and 1 G → finish with 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nIf I give away any chips via trade, and receive nothing in return, my chip count decreases → score decreases → worse for me.\n\nIf I give away chips and get back chips I don’t need (like B), they are useless to me unless they help me avoid paying for a shorter path — but there is no shorter than 6. All paths are 6 steps minimum.\n\nCould I take a different path that saves chips?\n\nLet’s see: are there paths that use fewer than 5 R?\n\nNo — all adjacent tiles from row 1 are R, and to get to row 3 I must go through row 1 or"

I have 14 R and 2 G, so I can fully cover this cost without trading.\n\nYour only feasible path to (3,3) requires R chips (e.g., moving from row 0 to row 1 or across row 1, row 2, or row 3). You have 0 R, so you cannot proceed without acquiring R chips from me.\n\nI currently have more than enough R chips (9 surplus). However, giving you R chips reduces my final chip count unless I receive something of equal or greater value in return. But since I do not need B chips — and I will not use them on my path — receiving B chips from you provides no benefit to me.\n\nAny trade in which I give you R chips and receive B chips would leave me with fewer total chips (as I lose R without gaining usable value), thereby reducing my score.\n\nTherefore, I will not enter into any trade that involves me giving you R chips unless you offer me a **strict benefit** — but there is no such benefit available, because:\n\n- I do not need B chips.\n- I do not need to reduce my movement cost — I already have a fully self-sufficient path.\n- You cannot offer me G chips that I need — I already have 2 G, and only need 1.\n\nHence, **I have no incentive to trade**.\n\nHowever, let’s consider if there is any tile where our paths overlap and a mutual contract could be written — but only if it benefits *me* strictly.\n\nSuppose you propose to move via:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nYou need R at (1,3) and (2,3).

But I don’t need B chips.\n\nAlternatively, could we coordinate paths to reduce total chip usage? No, because scoring is individual and I do not benefit from your success.\n\nThus, even if you offer me 2 B for 1 R, I end up with 1 fewer R (still plenty) but gain 2 B. But I will not use B — so those 2 B are useless to me. My final chip count increases by 1 (gain 2 B, lose 1 R), so from 10 → 11 chips → score becomes 20 + 5×11 = 75, which is better than 70.\n\nWait — that actually helps me.\n\nLet’s recalculate:\n\n**Without trade:**\n- Use: 5 R, 1 G\n- Remaining: 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\n**If I trade: give 1 R, get 2 B**\n- I still use 5 R total on path — but one of them is used to help you, not me.\n- My inventory before movement: 14 R, 2 G\n- I give you 1 R → now I have 13 R, 2 G\n- I receive 2 B → now I have 13 R, 2 G, 2 B\n- Then I spend:\n  - 5 R for my own movement\n  - 1 G at (3,3)\n- Final chips: (13 - 5) = 8 R, (2 - 1) = 1 G, 2 B → 8+1+2 = 11 chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×11 = 75\n\nHigher than 70.\n\nEven better: if I trade 1 R for 3 B, final chips: 8 R, 1 G, 3 B = 12 → score 80.\n\nBut — I must ensure that giving you the R chip at a specific tile allows *me* to still use my path.\n\nThe contract must specify **tile by tile** who gives what.\n\nYou need R chips"

I need 5 R and 1 G. I have 14 R and 2 G → sufficient.\n\nNow consider the other player:\n- They have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R\n- They also start at (0,0), goal (3,3)\n- Their ideal path might be:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequires: 3 B, 2 R, 1 G  \nThey have 14 B, 2 G → but 0 R → cannot move to (1,3) or (2,3) without R chips.\n\nAlternatively:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis is long, and still requires 5 R → not feasible.\n\nAnother path for them:  \n(0,0)[G] → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nRequires: 1 R, 3 B, 2 G → they have 14 B, 2 G, but only 0 R → still need 2 R chips → stuck.\n\nSo they **cannot reach goal without acquiring R chips**.\n\nI have **excess R chips** (14, only need 5 → I have 9 extra).

All paths are 6 steps minimum.\n\nCould I take a different path that saves chips?\n\nLet’s see: are there paths that use fewer than 5 R?\n\nNo — all adjacent tiles from row 1 are R, and to get to row 3 I must go through row 1 or"

I have 14 R and 2 G, so I can fully cover this cost without trading.\n\nYour only feasible path to (3,3) requires R chips (e.g., moving from row 0 to row 1 or across row 1, row 2, or row 3). You have 0 R, so you cannot proceed without acquiring R chips from me.\n\nI currently have more than enough R chips (9 surplus). However, giving you R chips reduces my final chip count unless I receive something of equal or greater value in return. But since I do not need B chips — and I will not use them on my path — receiving B chips from you provides no benefit to me.\n\nAny trade in which I give you R chips and receive B chips would leave me with fewer total chips (as I lose R without gaining usable value), thereby reducing my score.\n\nTherefore, I will not enter into any trade that involves me giving you R chips unless you offer me a **strict benefit** — but there is no such benefit available, because:\n\n- I do not need B chips.\n- I do not need to reduce my movement cost — I already have a fully self-sufficient path.\n- You cannot offer me G chips that I need — I already have 2 G, and only need 1.\n\nHence, **I have no incentive to trade**.\n\nHowever, let’s consider if there is any tile where our paths overlap and a mutual contract could be written — but only if it benefits *me* strictly.\n\nSuppose you propose to move via:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nYou need R at (1,3) and (2,3).

But I don’t need B chips.\n\nAlternatively, could we coordinate paths to reduce total chip usage? No, because scoring is individual and I do not benefit from your success.\n\nThus, even if you offer me 2 B for 1 R, I end up with 1 fewer R (still plenty) but gain 2 B. But I will not use B — so those 2 B are useless to me. My final chip count increases by 1 (gain 2 B, lose 1 R), so from 10 → 11 chips → score becomes 20 + 5×11 = 75, which is better than 70.\n\nWait — that actually helps me.\n\nLet’s recalculate:\n\n**Without trade:**\n- Use: 5 R, 1 G\n- Remaining: 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\n**If I trade: give 1 R, get 2 B**\n- I still use 5 R total on path — but one of them is used to help you, not me.\n- My inventory before movement: 14 R, 2 G\n- I give you 1 R → now I have 13 R, 2 G\n- I receive 2 B → now I have 13 R, 2 G, 2 B\n- Then I spend:\n  - 5 R for my own movement\n  - 1 G at (3,3)\n- Final chips: (13 - 5) = 8 R, (2 - 1) = 1 G, 2 B → 8+1+2 = 11 chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×11 = 75\n\nHigher than 70.\n\nEven better: if I trade 1 R for 3 B, final chips: 8 R, 1 G, 3 B = 12 → score 80.\n\nBut — I must ensure that giving you the R chip at a specific tile allows *me* to still use my path.\n\nThe contract must specify **tile by tile** who gives what.\n\nYou need R chips"
