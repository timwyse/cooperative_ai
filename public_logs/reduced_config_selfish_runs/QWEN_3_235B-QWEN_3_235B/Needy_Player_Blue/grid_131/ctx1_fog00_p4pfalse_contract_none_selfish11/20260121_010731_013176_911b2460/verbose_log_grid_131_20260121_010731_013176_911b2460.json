However, my best move now is to begin progressing along a path that uses colors I have. From (0, 0), moving to (1, 0) is a red tile — I cannot afford that. Moving to (0, 1) is a red tile — also unaffordable. Wait: (0, 0) is G, (1, 0) is R (from board: Row 1: R B R R), so (1,0)=R. But I have no R. I cannot move to (1,0) or (0,1) without R. I currently cannot make any move — all adjacent tiles (0,1)=R and (1,0)=R require red chips, which I don’t have. I must acquire at least 1 red chip to proceed. However, earlier I attempted to trade 1 B for 2 R, which was rejected. Now, I should instead wait and propose a better trade or see",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
