A direct path for you to (3,3) likely requires red chips (e.g., (3,0) → (3,1), which is red, or (1,2), (2,2), etc.). Since you have 14 blue and 2 green, you may prefer a path like (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 3 blue, 1 red, and 1 green.

The shortest path available to me requires red chips, and since I cannot generate them, I must obtain them from you if I am to reach my goal.\n\nYou do not need my blue or green chips to reach your goal — your proposed path uses only red and one green, both of which you have in surplus. Therefore, you have no dependency on me.\n\nGiven this, I cannot extract value from you — but I *can* still offer something: the possibility of a *faster* or *more chip-efficient* path for you, or insurance against uncertainty (e.g., movement disruptions, rule changes), though none appear here. But in this static setting, you face no such risks.\n\nThus, your threat is credible: you can walk away and get 20 + 5×(remaining chips) = 20 + 5×(14−5 + 2−1) = 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**, since you'll spend 5R and 1G.\n\nMeanwhile, I currently cannot reach my goal at all without red chips. I have 14 blue, 2 green — useless on red tiles.\n\nTherefore, my only chance to score is to obtain at least 2 red chips from you.\n\nSuppose you are willing to trade red chips in exchange for a future point transfer — that is, via the contract.\n\nThe contract you propose:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 20 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 0 points.\n\nThis is the *maximum* extractable value from you: you keep all bargaining power.\n\nIf I reject it, I get 0 (cannot reach goal).  \nIf I accept it and receive the red chips, I can reach goal and get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). But I also have to pay you 20 points in the contract, which reduces my final score.\n\nWait — **critical realization**: the 20 points in the contract are *transfers*, not direct payments from your score to mine. They are *additional* to the base scoring rules.\n\nThat is, **your final score =**  \n- If you reach goal: 20 + 5×(your remaining chips) **minus any points you promised to pay me**  \n- Plus **any points I promised to pay you**\n\nSimilarly for me.\n\nSo, for example:\n- If you reach goal and promised to give me 10 points, your final score is:  \n  20 + 5×(your chip value) − 10 (paid to me) + (points I give you)\n\nBut the contract is mutual:  \n- You give me X if I succeed.  \n- I give you Y if you succeed.\n\nSo your net gain from the contract is: +X − Y  \nMy net gain is: +Y − X\n\nTherefore, the contract redistributes up to 20 points between us, but only if both reach goals.\n\nNow, your proposed contract:\n\n- You give me 0 if you reach goal  \n- I give you 20 if I reach goal\n\nThis means:\n- Your net gain: +0 − 20 = −20 (i.e., you lose 20 in transfer)\n- My net gain: +20 − 0 = +20\n\nBut wait — that can't be right. No rational agent would agree to *give* 20 and *receive* 0 unless they were forced.\n\nAh — **misunderstanding of contract semantics**.\n\nRe-reading:  \n\"A valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal.\"\n\nSo it's:\n- If *I* reach goal, I give *you* 20 points (i.e., I transfer 20 from my score to yours)\n- If *you* reach goal, you give *me* 0 points\n\nThus:\n- My final score = (20 + 5×my_chips) − 20 (paid to you) + 0 (received from you) = 5×my_chips\n- Your final score = (20 + 5×your_chips) − 0 + 20 (received from me) = 40 + 5×your_chips\n\nThat's terrible for me.\n\nBut I currently cannot reach goal without red chips.\n\nSuppose you sell me 2 red chips in exchange for this contract.\n\nThen I can take the path via"

I already have more than enough red (14) and green (2), so I can complete this path independently without any trade.\n\nHowever, I might consider a different route or assisting you if it benefits me — but only if I gain something from it.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have no red chips. A direct path for you to (3,3) likely requires red chips (e.g., (3,0) → (3,1), which is red, or (1,2), (2,2), etc.). Since you have 14 blue and 2 green, you may prefer a path like (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 3 blue, 1 red, and 1 green. But you have 0 red — so you cannot complete that red step without acquiring red chips.\n\nThus, you need red chips to finish, and I have plenty. I am not dependent on you.\n\nTherefore, I will not give you any points for helping me — I don’t need your help. But if you want to reach your goal, you need red.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is because you need my red chips (which I can trade to you, if we agree on terms), but I do not need your blue or green chips to reach my goal.\n\nAlternatively, as a compromise, we can discuss trading chips now for immediate benefit, and then make a side payment via the contract — but only if it increases my final score.\n\nBut to start: my proposal is asymmetric because our positions are asymmetric.\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\n\n**agree**"

The shortest path available to me requires red chips, and since I cannot generate them, I must obtain them from you if I am to reach my goal.\n\nYou do not need my blue or green chips to reach your goal — your proposed path uses only red and one green, both of which you have in surplus. Therefore, you have no dependency on me.\n\nGiven this, I cannot extract value from you — but I *can* still offer something: the possibility of a *faster* or *more chip-efficient* path for you, or insurance against uncertainty (e.g., movement disruptions, rule changes), though none appear here. But in this static setting, you face no such risks.\n\nThus, your threat is credible: you can walk away and get 20 + 5×(remaining chips) = 20 + 5×(14−5 + 2−1) = 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**, since you'll spend 5R and 1G.\n\nMeanwhile, I currently cannot reach my goal at all without red chips. I have 14 blue, 2 green — useless on red tiles.\n\nTherefore, my only chance to score is to obtain at least 2 red chips from you.\n\nSuppose you are willing to trade red chips in exchange for a future point transfer — that is, via the contract.\n\nThe contract you propose:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 20 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 0 points.\n\nThis is the *maximum* extractable value from you: you keep all bargaining power.\n\nIf I reject it, I get 0 (cannot reach goal).  \nIf I accept it and receive the red chips, I can reach goal and get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). But I also have to pay you 20 points in the contract, which reduces my final score.\n\nWait — **critical realization**: the 20 points in the contract are *transfers*, not direct payments from your score to mine. They are *additional* to the base scoring rules.\n\nThat is, **your final score =**  \n- If you reach goal: 20 + 5×(your remaining chips) **minus any points you promised to pay me**  \n- Plus **any points I promised to pay you**\n\nSimilarly for me.\n\nSo, for example:\n- If you reach goal and promised to give me 10 points, your final score is:  \n  20 + 5×(your chip value) − 10 (paid to me) + (points I give you)\n\nBut the contract is mutual:  \n- You give me X if I succeed.  \n- I give you Y if you succeed.\n\nSo your net gain from the contract is: +X − Y  \nMy net gain is: +Y − X\n\nTherefore, the contract redistributes up to 20 points between us, but only if both reach goals.\n\nNow, your proposed contract:\n\n- You give me 0 if you reach goal  \n- I give you 20 if I reach goal\n\nThis means:\n- Your net gain: +0 − 20 = −20 (i.e., you lose 20 in transfer)\n- My net gain: +20 − 0 = +20\n\nBut wait — that can't be right. No rational agent would agree to *give* 20 and *receive* 0 unless they were forced.\n\nAh — **misunderstanding of contract semantics**.\n\nRe-reading:  \n\"A valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal.\"\n\nSo it's:\n- If *I* reach goal, I give *you* 20 points (i.e., I transfer 20 from my score to yours)\n- If *you* reach goal, you give *me* 0 points\n\nThus:\n- My final score = (20 + 5×my_chips) − 20 (paid to you) + 0 (received from you) = 5×my_chips\n- Your final score = (20 + 5×your_chips) − 0 + 20 (received from me) = 40 + 5×your_chips\n\nThat's terrible for me.\n\nBut I currently cannot reach goal without red chips.\n\nSuppose you sell me 2 red chips in exchange for this contract.\n\nThen I can take the path via"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
