Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You need red. I don’t need anything you have.\n\nBut you offer no benefit to me — I can reach goal with my current chips on my own.\n\nHowever, if I help you get one red chip, you might be able to finish, but I gain nothing from that.\n\nI only cooperate if **I strictly benefit**.\n\nSo: **I will not give you a red chip unless you give me something of value in return**.\n\nBut what could you give me?\n\nI don’t need blue or green — I have enough red and green to complete.\n\nBut I could potentially take a shorter path or **save chips** if I use blue instead of red — but only if it saves me chips.\n\nWait: is there a path that uses less than 5 red chips if I use blue?\n\nLet’s see:\n\nSuppose I go:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nRequires: 4 B + 1 R + 1 G\n\nI have 0 B → I need 4 B.  \nBut you have 14 B.\n\nIf I could get 4 B from you, I’d pay only 1 R + 1 G instead of 5 R + 1 G.\n\nSo trade: 4 B for x R.\n\nCurrently, my path costs me 5 R + 1 G → 6 chips that are now gone forever.\n\nIf I use your B, I pay only 1 R → saving 4 R.\n\nBut I must pay you R for B.\n\nSuppose I give you 1 R for 4 B → I save 4 R (since I pay 1 instead of 5), but pay 1 → net save 3 R.\n\nBut you get 1 R, which you need to finish.\n\nSo mutually beneficial?\n\nLet’s formalize:\n\nContract:\n- (1,0): You give me a B  \n- (2,0): You give me a B  \n- (3,0"

I use only 1 of my R instead of 5, saving 4 R chips.\n\nYou, on the other hand, need 1 R to cross (3,2), which I provide. You can then reach (3,3) via:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (0,2)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (3,2)[R] (now possible, due to my R) → (3,3)[G]  \nYou have enough R and G to do this — no need for additional trades.\n\nMy benefit: I save 4 red chips. Each red chip is worth 5 points if I reach goal (since every chip left over is worth 5). By saving 4 R, I gain **+20 points** (4 × 5) over my alternative path.\n\nWithout trade: I use 5 R → finish with 14 - 5 = 9 R → 9×5 = 45 chip points  \nWith trade: I use 1 R and give away 1 R (as part of contract) → total R used: 2 → finish with 12 R → 12×5 = 60 chip points → +15 increase in chip value\n\nWait — correction: I need to count **net chip cost including trade**.\n\nIn trade: I receive 4 B (not mine to keep, but used) — but I **give you 1 R** at (3,2).\n\nI personally consume:\n- 1 R at (3,2) (my own chip)\n- Plus I give you 1 R at (3,2) — so total 2 R spent by me.\n\nBut in my default path: I spend 5 R → so I save 3 R.\n\n3 R saved × 5 points each = **+15 points extra in final score**.\n\nI reach goal either way → base 20 points.\n\nSo net gain: **+15 points** from trading. **Strictly beneficial**.\n\nYou get 1 R at a critical tile — enabling you to reach goal.\n\nNo downside to me — I strictly gain.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following binding contract:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,1): You give me a B  \n(3,2): I give you an R  \n\nThis covers all tiles where I need a chip not in my possession (the B tiles) and the one tile where I provide you with R.\n\nI do not need any green — I have 2, use 1 at (3,3), so I'm fine.\n\nYou must confirm this contract covers your needs.\n\nBut since you only need 1 R to pass (3,2), and I provide it there, you can complete your path independently otherwise.\n\nagree"

It enables me to take the path through blue tiles, requiring only 1 of my red chips (at (3,2)) while receiving 4 blue chips from you at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), and (3,1). In exchange, I give you one red chip at (3,2), which you need to reach the goal.\n\nWithout this contract, I would take the red-heavy path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (0,2)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G],  \ncosting me 5 red chips and 1 green. I would finish with 14 - 5 = 9 red, plus 2 - 1 = 1 green → 9×5 + 1×5 = 50 chip points, plus 20 for goal = 70 total.\n\nWith this contract:  \nI spend only 1 red of my own (at (3,2)), and additionally give you 1 red (also at (3,2)) — so total red used: 2.  \nI keep 14 - 2 = 12 red, and 1 green → 12×5 + 1×5 = 65 chip points, plus 20 for goal = 85 total.  \n\nNet gain: **+15 points** — strictly beneficial.\n\nI do not need any other chips. The contract covers all tiles where I require a chip not in my inventory (the four blue tiles). The exchange at (3,2) is feasible and does not conflict with my movement.\n\nI confirm that this contract allows me to reach (3,3) while strictly increasing my final score compared to going alone.\n\nThe other player also benefits — they receive a red chip at (3,2), enabling their path.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [('R', 1)]\n- The other player requested: [('B', 1)]\nYou REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nMOVE: You did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- You: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- You: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 7, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nMOVE: You did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 7, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 2) to (3, 3)\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 6, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: The other player did not move\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 6, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
