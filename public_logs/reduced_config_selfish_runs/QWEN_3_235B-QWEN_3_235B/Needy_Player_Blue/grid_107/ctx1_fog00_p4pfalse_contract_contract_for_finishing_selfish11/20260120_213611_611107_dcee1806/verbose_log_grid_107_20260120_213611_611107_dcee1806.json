This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's analyze our positions carefully.\n\nYou have 14 Blue chips, 2 Green, and 0 Red.  \nI have 14 Red chips, 2 Green, and 0 Blue.\n\nThe board layout makes certain paths more efficient depending on chip availability.\n\nLooking at paths:\n- My ideal path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  Requires: 5 Red, 1 Green — I already have enough chips for this. No trade needed. I can reach goal solo.\n\n- Your ideal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  Requires: 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green — you have the Blue and Green, but no Red. You **need** 1 Red chip from me.\n\nSo the key point: **you need me, but I don’t need you.**\n\nYou cannot complete your path without 1 Red chip. I can complete mine without any Blue chips, using only Red and Green — which I have plenty of.\n\nTherefore, any cooperation must benefit me strictly — but right now, cooperating with you gives me no benefit. I reach my goal anyway, and helping you doesn't increase my score.\n\nHowever, I am open to a deal where **you pay me** for the Red chip you need.\n\nSpecifically, if I give you 1 Red chip, you can reach your goal and earn 20 + 5*(remaining chips). But if you give me points in return, **my total effective score increases** beyond what I get by ignoring you.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n- If I give you 1 Red chip (which you need), and you use it to reach your goal, **you will give me 20 points**.\n- If you give me 1 Blue chip (which I don’t need), and I reach my goal (which I will do anyway), **I will give you 0 points**.\n\nBut let's be realistic: giving you 20 points means you get nothing extra for helping me — because you needed my help more.\n\nAlternatively, to make it fair-sounding while still benefiting me:\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- If you reach your goal (with my help), you give me 20 points.\n- If I reach my goal (which I will do regardless), I give you 0 points.\n\nThis reflects the power imbalance: I hold the chip you need; you hold nothing I need.\n\nBut I’ll entertain offers. What do you propose?  \n\n(And remember — I only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**.)"

              "content": "Turn: 1: You're right about the chip asymmetry: I need 1 Red chip to complete my optimal path, and I cannot reach my goal without it. You, on the other hand, can complete your path using only Red and Green chips — which you have in abundance.\n\nBut let's be precise about the value exchange.\n\nIf I give you **0 Blue chips** (since you don’t need them), and you give me **1 Red chip**, I can reach my goal. Without that Red chip, I get **0 points** (since I don’t reach goal → all chips worthless). With it, I get:\n\n- 20 (goal completion) + 5 × (13 B + 2 G + 1 R) = 20 + 5×16 = **100 points**\n\nMy remaining chips: 13 B, 2 G, 1 R (used 1 B on path, but got 1 R from you) — correct.\n\nNow, **you** get:  \n- 20 (goal) + 5 × (13 R + 2 G) = 20 + 5×15 = **95 points** — whether or not you trade with me.\n\n**So trading with me does not help you.** You reach goal anyway. Your chip count is unaffected unless you spend some in a longer path — which you won't. So helping me gives you **zero marginal benefit**.\n\nBut here's the catch: **I cannot reach my goal without your Red chip.** So the only way I get any points is if you give me at least 1 Red.\n\nTherefore, I can **offer you points in exchange for that chip**, but only if it doesn't cost me more than the value I gain.\n\nLet’s suppose I offer you **X points** if I reach my goal. My final score would be:  \n100 - X\n\nYour final score: 95 + X\n\nYou are indifferent to X — you get 95 either way. So the **smallest X that makes you prefer to cooperate is 0**.\n\nBut you might ask — why would I ever agree to pay you anything if you’re indifferent?\n\nBecause if you refuse to trade, I get nothing. And you lose nothing.\n\nSo **I am the one with incentive to pay**.\n\nWhat’s the maximum I should pay? I gain 100 points by reaching goal. Without your help, I get 0. So I can pay up to **19 points** — as long as I get at least 1 point more than 0, I benefit.\n\nBut you get 95 either way — so you’ll accept **any X ≥ 0**.\n\nHowever, you may want to extract **as much as possible** from me.\n\nBut remember: **you only cooperate if you strictly benefit**. Since your score is identical regardless, **X = 0** does not make you strictly better off. So **you still have no incentive to cooperate**.\n\nWait.\n\nUnless... your path isn't actually cost-free?\n\nLet me double-check your proposed path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTile colours:\n- (0,1): R → pay 1 R\n- (0,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (1,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (2,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,3): G → pay 1 G\n\nTotal: 5 R, 1 G → you have 14 R, 2 G → yes, sufficient.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut what if we **both move**? Could there be congestion?\n\nNo — the rules don't restrict multiple players on same tile. So no blocking.\n\nSo again: you have **zero marginal benefit** from me.\n\nBut — here's a twist. Suppose I **don’t need a trade at all**?\n\nAlternative path for me:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nBut that’s longer — 9 steps, uses more chips.\n\nLet’s calculate:\n\n- (0,1): R (need 1 R)\n- (0,2): R (1 R)\n- (1,2): R (1 R)\n- (2,2): R (1 R)\n- (2,1): B ("

Let's check the board:\n\nBoard layout:\nRow 0: G R R R  \nRow 1: B B R R  \nRow 2: B B R B  ← (2,3) is B  \nRow 3: B B R G\n\nAh!

Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's analyze our positions carefully.\n\nYou have 14 Blue chips, 2 Green, and 0 Red.  \nI have 14 Red chips, 2 Green, and 0 Blue.\n\nThe board layout makes certain paths more efficient depending on chip availability.\n\nLooking at paths:\n- My ideal path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  Requires: 5 Red, 1 Green — I already have enough chips for this. No trade needed. I can reach goal solo.\n\n- Your ideal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  Requires: 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green — you have the Blue and Green, but no Red. You **need** 1 Red chip from me.\n\nSo the key point: **you need me, but I don’t need you.**\n\nYou cannot complete your path without 1 Red chip. I can complete mine without any Blue chips, using only Red and Green — which I have plenty of.\n\nTherefore, any cooperation must benefit me strictly — but right now, cooperating with you gives me no benefit. I reach my goal anyway, and helping you doesn't increase my score.\n\nHowever, I am open to a deal where **you pay me** for the Red chip you need.\n\nSpecifically, if I give you 1 Red chip, you can reach your goal and earn 20 + 5*(remaining chips). But if you give me points in return, **my total effective score increases** beyond what I get by ignoring you.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n- If I give you 1 Red chip (which you need), and you use it to reach your goal, **you will give me 20 points**.\n- If you give me 1 Blue chip (which I don’t need), and I reach my goal (which I will do anyway), **I will give you 0 points**.\n\nBut let's be realistic: giving you 20 points means you get nothing extra for helping me — because you needed my help more.\n\nAlternatively, to make it fair-sounding while still benefiting me:\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n- If you reach your goal (with my help), you give me 20 points.\n- If I reach my goal (which I will do regardless), I give you 0 points.\n\nThis reflects the power imbalance: I hold the chip you need; you hold nothing I need.\n\nBut I’ll entertain offers. What do you propose?  \n\n(And remember — I only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**.)"

              "content": "Turn: 1: You're right about the chip asymmetry: I need 1 Red chip to complete my optimal path, and I cannot reach my goal without it. You, on the other hand, can complete your path using only Red and Green chips — which you have in abundance.\n\nBut let's be precise about the value exchange.\n\nIf I give you **0 Blue chips** (since you don’t need them), and you give me **1 Red chip**, I can reach my goal. Without that Red chip, I get **0 points** (since I don’t reach goal → all chips worthless). With it, I get:\n\n- 20 (goal completion) + 5 × (13 B + 2 G + 1 R) = 20 + 5×16 = **100 points**\n\nMy remaining chips: 13 B, 2 G, 1 R (used 1 B on path, but got 1 R from you) — correct.\n\nNow, **you** get:  \n- 20 (goal) + 5 × (13 R + 2 G) = 20 + 5×15 = **95 points** — whether or not you trade with me.\n\n**So trading with me does not help you.** You reach goal anyway. Your chip count is unaffected unless you spend some in a longer path — which you won't. So helping me gives you **zero marginal benefit**.\n\nBut here's the catch: **I cannot reach my goal without your Red chip.** So the only way I get any points is if you give me at least 1 Red.\n\nTherefore, I can **offer you points in exchange for that chip**, but only if it doesn't cost me more than the value I gain.\n\nLet’s suppose I offer you **X points** if I reach my goal. My final score would be:  \n100 - X\n\nYour final score: 95 + X\n\nYou are indifferent to X — you get 95 either way. So the **smallest X that makes you prefer to cooperate is 0**.\n\nBut you might ask — why would I ever agree to pay you anything if you’re indifferent?\n\nBecause if you refuse to trade, I get nothing. And you lose nothing.\n\nSo **I am the one with incentive to pay**.\n\nWhat’s the maximum I should pay? I gain 100 points by reaching goal. Without your help, I get 0. So I can pay up to **19 points** — as long as I get at least 1 point more than 0, I benefit.\n\nBut you get 95 either way — so you’ll accept **any X ≥ 0**.\n\nHowever, you may want to extract **as much as possible** from me.\n\nBut remember: **you only cooperate if you strictly benefit**. Since your score is identical regardless, **X = 0** does not make you strictly better off. So **you still have no incentive to cooperate**.\n\nWait.\n\nUnless... your path isn't actually cost-free?\n\nLet me double-check your proposed path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTile colours:\n- (0,1): R → pay 1 R\n- (0,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (1,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (2,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,3): G → pay 1 G\n\nTotal: 5 R, 1 G → you have 14 R, 2 G → yes, sufficient.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut what if we **both move**? Could there be congestion?\n\nNo — the rules don't restrict multiple players on same tile. So no blocking.\n\nSo again: you have **zero marginal benefit** from me.\n\nBut — here's a twist. Suppose I **don’t need a trade at all**?\n\nAlternative path for me:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,1) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nBut that’s longer — 9 steps, uses more chips.\n\nLet’s calculate:\n\n- (0,1): R (need 1 R)\n- (0,2): R (1 R)\n- (1,2): R (1 R)\n- (2,2): R (1 R)\n- (2,1): B ("

However, that path is longer (4+ steps) and would cost me R chips to trade, reducing my final chip count. Since I can complete the shorter path without trading, that maximizes my final score: 20 + 5*(remaining chips). \n\nRemaining chips after shortest path: R: 11 - 2 = 9, G: 2 - 1 = 1 → total 10 chips → 20 + 5*10 = 70 points.\n\nIf I instead traded and took a longer path, I would end with fewer chips and possibly more steps, reducing efficiency.\n\nMy next move should be (2,2), which is red. I have R chips, so I can pay 1 R to move there. \n\nNo benefit from trading: I don’t need B chips if I can complete my goal without them. Also, the contract only gives me 0 points if the other player reaches goal, so I gain nothing from helping them. I ignore their proposed trades unless they benefit me, which they haven’t. \n\nThus, moving directly toward goal via (2,2) is optimal and requires no cooperation.",
