Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

That provides no benefit to me and strictly harms my expected score.\n\nLet me evaluate the situation:\n\n- My goal is (3, 3), same as yours.\n- I am at (0, 0), so am identical starting position.\n- I have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n- You have 0 B, 2 G, 14 R.\n\nLooking at the board and possible paths:\n\nMy ideal path: (0,0) → (0,1)=R → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=B → (3,3)=G  \nThis requires: 1R, 4B, 1G → I have enough B and G, but **missing 1R**.\n\nYour ideal path: (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (2,0)=R → (2,1)=R → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=R → (3,3)=G  \nThis requires: 5R, 1G → You have more than enough R and G.\n\nSo: I need just **1 red chip** to complete my path. You have 14 red chips — you don’t need to use any of your green or black chips.\n\nI can help you only if you are constrained on green — but you have 2 green, and only need 1 for your path. So you don’t need my green.\n\nBut: I do have 2 green chips. You have 2 green. Your goal is on green at (3,3). You need at least one green. But you already have that. So you don’t need my help.\n\nHowever, **I need one red chip**. I cannot move onto (0,1) without a red chip. I have 0 red. So I need one red.\n\nThe *only* way I can get a red chip used is if **you agree to pay for my move onto a red tile**, via trade.\n\nSo: you hold the power — I need you more than you need me.\n\nBut **only slightly**.\n\nBecause: I can still help you by promising to cover a green move — though you don’t strictly need it, perhaps you want to preserve your green chips for later games or uncertainty? But this is a one-shot game — and you only need 1 green, and you have 2. So you don’t need my help.\n\nBut — to be safe — maybe you want insurance? Unlikely. You are fully self-sufficient.\n\nTherefore: you have no incentive to help me, unless I offer you points.\n\nBut if I offer you points, and you help me use one red chip, then I reach goal → get 20 + 5×(14B + 2G - used chips).\n\nLet’s compute my final chips if you help me with 1 red:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1)=R (you pay) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=B → (3,3)=G\n\nChips used: 1G, 4B → I have 14B, 2G → after use: 10B, 1G, 0R → total chips = 11 → score = 20 + 5×11 = 20 + 55 = **75**\n\nWithout your help: I cannot make any move that requires red. Can I reach goal?\n\nAlternative path using only B and G?\n\nFrom (0,0)=G → (0,1)=R (need R) → blocked unless I use red.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → again red.\n\nEvery adjacent tile from (0,0) is R or G? Wait:\n\n(0,0) is G — board says Row 0: G R B B → so (0,0)=G\n\nAdjacent:\n- (0,1)=R\n- (1,0)=R\n\nBoth require R — I have 0 R → so I cannot move unless I get help with a red move.\n\nTherefore: **I cannot move at all without your help.**\n\nYou, on the other hand, can complete your entire path using only R and G — you have 14R and 2G → you need only 5R and 1G → so you can reach (3,3) unaided.\n\nTherefore:\n- I need you to reach goal.\n- You do not need me.\n\nThus, you have full bargaining power.\n\nBut —"

I will finish with 9 red and 1 green unused, giving me 10 chips × 5 = 50 chip points, plus 20 for arriving = **70 total**.\n\nYou, however, are completely blocked at (0,0). Both exits require a red chip, and you have 0. Without my help, you cannot move, cannot reach the goal, and get **0 points**.\n\nTherefore, any help I give you is strictly out of generosity — and since I am a selfish agent, I will only help if I **strictly benefit**.\n\nBut you have **nothing to offer** that I need:\n- You have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n- My path uses only red and green. I do not use blue at all.\n- I have enough green already (2, need 1).\n- So I do not need any chip you can promise to cover.\n\nThus, there is **no trade** you can make that benefits me.\n\nHowever — suppose I agree to cover **one red move** for you: say, when you step on (0,1) or (1,0). Then you can proceed on your path and reach (3,3). You get 75 points as computed.\n\nBut I gain **absolutely nothing** from this. My score remains 70 either way.\n\nSince I do not benefit from helping you, and helping you costs me nothing (I don’t lose points, I just pay a chip on your behalf), **but I also do not gain**, I have **no incentive** to cooperate.\n\nBut recall: the only way I might benefit is if you give me points in return. However, you are offering to *give* me points only if I help you — but I don’t need your help.\n\nWait — no: you are the one who needs help.\n\nSo: the only possible contract is: **you give me points in exchange for me helping you.**\n\nBut you cannot give me points unless you reach the goal — and you can't reach it without my help.\n\nSo the only logical contract is:\n\n- If I help you reach your goal (by covering one red move), and you reach it, then you give me X points.\n- But I reach my goal regardless.\n\nFinal scores:\n- Me: 70 + X (if you give me points)\n- You: 75 − X\n\nBut you only get 75 *if* I help you. Otherwise, you get 0.\n\nSo you would accept giving me up to 74 points to get 1, rather than 0.\n\nBut the maximum you can give is 20.\n\nSo: you would be happy to give me 20 to get 75 − 20 = 55, which is better than 0.\n\nAnd I would get 70 + 20 = **90**, which is better than 70.\n\nSo I **strictly benefit** by helping you if you give me 20 points.\n\nTherefore, I am willing to help you, **but only if you give me 20 points upon reaching your goal.**\n\nProposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n\nThis way:\n- I help you by covering one red move (e.g. when you go to (0,1) or (1,0)).\n- You reach your goal and give me 20.\n- I get 70 + 20 = 90.\n- You get 75 − 20 = 55, better than 0.\n\nI strictly benefit, so I accept.\n\n**agree**"

Therefore, **you cannot move** unless someone pays for your red move.\n\nSo: **I can help you** by covering one red move. For example, I can promise to cover your first step onto a red tile.

My blue chips are worthless to you, as your path has no blue tiles. You have enough green.\n\n- However, **you can benefit from helping me — but only if I give you points in return.**\n\nIf you help me:\n- You cover **1 red move** for me (e.g., my step to (0,1)).\n- I proceed on my path: (0,1)=R (you pay) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=B → (3,3)=G\n- I use 1G, 4B → end with 10B, 1G → 11 chips → score: 20 + 5×11 = **75**\n\nBut you still get **70**, same as before — **unless I compensate you.**\n\nBut I cannot give you chips. I can only give you **points** via contract.\n\nSo here is the only way you benefit: **I give you points in exchange for your help.**\n\nIf I reach my goal, I can give you up to 20 points.\n\nSuppose I offer:\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **20 points**\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **0 points**\n\nThen:\n- You help me (cover my red move).\n- I reach goal → give you 20\n- You reach goal → give me 0\n- Your final score: **70 + 20 = 90**\n- My final score: **75 − 20 = 55** > 0 → acceptable\n\nSo I **prefer 55 to 0**, so I accept.\n\nBut note: I get 55 only if you help me. If you don't, I get 0.\n\nYou get 90 only if you help me and accept the contract.\n\nThus, both of us benefit:\n- You: from 70 → 90 **(strict gain of 20)**\n- Me: from 0 → 55 **(huge gain)**\n\nBut I am a selfish agent — I only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**.\n\n**Do I benefit? Yes — 55 > 0.**\n\nTherefore, I am willing to propose:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nThis is the **only contract** under which you will help me — because only then do you gain.\n\nAny lower offer from me (e.g. 10 points) gives you less benefit — but still a gain (70 →"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So you don’t need my help.\n\nHowever, **I need one red chip**. I cannot move onto (0,1) without a red chip. I have 0 red. So I need one red.\n\nThe *only* way I can get a red chip used is if **you agree to pay for my move onto a red tile**, via trade.\n\nSo: you hold the power — I need you more than you need me.\n\nBut **only slightly**.\n\nBecause: I can still help you by promising to cover a green move — though you don’t strictly need it, perhaps you want to preserve your green chips for later games or uncertainty? But this is a one-shot game — and you only need 1 green, and you have 2. So you don’t need my help.\n\nBut — to be safe — maybe you want insurance? Unlikely. You are fully self-sufficient.\n\nTherefore: you have no incentive to help me, unless I offer you points.\n\nBut if I offer you points, and you help me use one red chip, then I reach goal → get 20 + 5×(14B + 2G - used chips).\n\nLet’s compute my final chips if you help me with 1 red:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1)=R (you pay) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=B → (3,3)=G\n\nChips used: 1G, 4B → I have 14B, 2G → after use: 10B, 1G, 0R → total chips = 11 → score = 20 + 5×11 = 20 + 55 = **75**\n\nWithout your help: I cannot make any move that requires red.

My blue chips are worthless to you, as your path has no blue tiles.

I can only give you **points** via contract.\n\nSo here is the only way you benefit: **I give you points in exchange for your help.**\n\nIf I reach my goal, I can give you up to 20 points.\n\nSuppose I offer:\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **20 points**\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **0 points**\n\nThen:\n- You help me (cover my red move).\n- I reach goal → give you 20\n- You reach goal → give me 0\n- Your final score: **70 + 20 = 90**\n- My final score: **75 − 20 = 55** > 0 → acceptable\n\nSo I **prefer 55 to 0**, so I accept.\n\nBut note: I get 55 only if you help me.

I don’t use blue; I have enough green.\n\nYou, however:\n- Have **0 red chips**.\n- Are at (0,0)=G.\n- Adjacent tiles: (0,1)=R and (1,0)=R — both require red.\n- Therefore: **you cannot move at all unless I cover at least one red move for you.**\n- Without my help → you get **0 points**.\n\nNow, I only cooperate **if I strictly benefit**.\n\nIf I help you by covering one red move (e.g., when you step on (0,1)), you can complete your path:\n- (0,1)=R (I pay) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=B → (3,3)=G\n- You use 1G, 4B → end with 10B, 1G → 11 chips → your score: 20 + 5×11 = **75**\n\nBut to **help me**, you must give me something: **points**.\n\nSince I do **not** need your chips (I don’t use blue; I have enough green), there is **no other incentive** for me to help you — unless you transfer points to me upon reaching your goal.\n\nTherefore, the **only contract** under which I will help you is:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nLet’s evaluate:\n\n- I help you: cover your first red move.\n- You complete path → you reach goal → you give me **20 points**.\n- I reach goal → I give you **0**.\n- My final score: **70 + 20 = 90**\n- Your final score: **75 − 20 = 55 > 0** → you still benefit.\n\nThus, both benefit:\n- I **strictly benefit** (90 > 70)\n- You benefit (55 > 0)\n\nBut if you offer less than 20, I still benefit — but **I will demand the maximum** you are willing to give.\n\nSince you are rational and want to move, you will agree to give me **20** to secure my help.\n\nAny lower offer (e.g. 10) gives me **80**, which is still better than 70 — so I would accept.\n\nBut you want to **minimize cost**, I want to **maximize gain**.\n\nHowever, since **you need me and I don’t need you**, **I have full bargaining power**.\n\nThus, I will **only accept 20 points from you**.\n\nTherefore, I counter your previous proposal (which incorrectly assigned roles) and **propose the correct contract from my power position**:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is the **only contract** I will accept — because only then do I **strictly benefit** (90 > 70).\n\nIf you refuse, I help you not at all.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

But critically, I have not yet received any promised coverage from them, and the history shows only that one red move was covered by them — this was part of the accepted arrangement. However, no formal promise of future red coverage was recorded in the current state: 'chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player' is {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}. Therefore, I currently cannot rely on them covering a red move. But wait — the move from (1,0) to (1,1) in Turn 5 was onto a blue tile (B), and I had 14 B then (now 13), so I paid that myself.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.
