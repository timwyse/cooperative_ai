Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

My optimal path is:  \n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**  \nThis requires **5 Red (R)** and **1 Green (G)** chips — I have enough (R: 14, G: 2) to complete this path independently, with **9 Red and 1 Green** remaining.  \nThat means I can reach my goal **without any trade**, giving me a guaranteed **20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points**.\n\nNow, let's evaluate your situation.  \nYour optimal path likely is:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)**  \nThis requires **4 Blue (B), 1 Red (R), 1 Green (G)**.  \nYou have **B:14, G:2, but R:0** — so you **cannot** complete the path without **at least 1 Red chip**.\n\nYou need me. I don't need you.\n\nHowever, perhaps I could benefit from cooperation — but only if it increases my final score beyond 70.\n\nSuppose I *donate* you 1 Red chip. You use it to reach your goal. In return, you *transfer* me 20 points (maximum allowed).  \nThen:\n- I still reach goal: chips = 13 R, 1 G → 14 chips → 20 + 5×14 = **90 points**\n- But I gave away 1 chip to help you, so my chips are 13 R, not 14 → wait: no.\nWait: originally I used 5 R and 1 G → 14 - 5 = 9 R left. If I give you 1 R, then I have 8 R left → total chips: 8+1 = 9 → score = 20 + 5×9 = 65  \nI get 20 *from you* as transfer → **65 + 20 = 85**\n\nBut if I don’t cooperate, I get **70**.\n\nBut if I cooperate: I get 65 (base) + 20 (transfer) = **85**, which is **better than 70**.\n\nSo **I benefit from cooperation only if you transfer me 20 points**.\n\nBut if you transfer me less than 20, say Y < 20, then my total is 65 + Y.  \nI want this > 70 → Y > 5. So as long as Y ≥ 6, it's better than going alone.\n\nBut you only benefit if I give you *at least* 1 Red chip.\n\nSo a viable contract exists.\n\nBut wait — can I get more than 85? No, max transfer is 20.\n\nBut let's be strategic. Since you need me and I don't *strictly* need you, I have leverage.\n\nHowever, giving you 0 points in return would make you less motivated — but you still might accept as long as you gain from helping.\n\nBut you are also selfish. You'll only accept if helping me increases *your* score vs doing it alone.\n\nWait — can you reach goal alone? Only if you somehow get a Red chip. You have 14 Blue. But no Red. Without a trade, you can't reach goal → you get **0 points**.\n\nSo your only way to get positive score is to cooperate — and for that, you need Red.\n\nI control Red.\n\nSo I can extract maximum value.\n\nLet me calculate your best possible score *with* my help.\n\nOption: I give you 1 Red. You use a path requiring 1 Red (like the one above). You end with:\n- 13 Blue, 1 Green (used 1 B, 1 G along way? Let's check)\n\nPath:  \n(0,0): start  \n(0,1): B → pay 1 B (13 left)  \n(1,1): B → pay 1 B (12 left)  \n(2,1): B → pay 1 B (11 left)  \n(2,2): B → pay 1 B (10 left)  \n(3,2): R → need 1 R — I give it → you pay it → now you have 10 B"

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
