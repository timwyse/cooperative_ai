I can complete the path using only my existing chips if I take the following route:  \n\n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n- Costs: 5 R, 1 G → I have more than enough.  \n- After moving, I'd have at least 9 R and 1 G left → final score: 20 + 5×(10) = 70 points.\n\nHowever, I notice you have **14 Blue (B)** and **2 Green (G)**, but **0 Red (R)**. This means:\n- You cannot use any Red tile without help.\n- The path **(0,0) → (1,0)** requires **R**, which I can pay but you cannot.\n- But moving early onto Blue tiles benefits you.\n\nLet’s consider your likely best path:  \n**(0,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**  \n- Requires: 1 R, 4 B, 1 G  \n- You lack R entirely → you **need me** to give you 1 R at (1,0) or (0,0) so you can reach (1,0), but that tile is not on your optimal path.\n\nWait — you **don’t need** to go through (1,0). Your best path might instead be:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**?  \nBut (0,1) is **B**, (1,1) is **R**, (2,1) is **B**, (3,1) is **B**, (3,2) is **B**, (3,3) is **G**  \n→ Requires: 1 B, 1 R, 2 B, 2 B, 1 G = Total: **1 R, 5 B, 1 G** → you have **14 B, 2 G, 0 R** → you’re missing **1 R**\n\nSo you **will need 1 R** from me to proceed.\n\nAlternatively:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n(0,1)=B, (0,2)=R, (1,2)=R, (2,2)=R, (2,3)=B, (3,3)=G → Requires: 1B, 2R, 1B, 1G → 2B, 2R, 1G → still need **2 R** → worse.\n\nSo every path for you needs **at least 1 R**.\n\nTherefore, **you need me**. But I don’t strictly need you — I can reach my goal without any trade, as my path only requires **5 R + 1 G**, and I currently have **14 R, 2 G**.\n\nThus, **cooperation only benefits me if I gain something** — i.e., if I can reduce my chip cost and thus increase my final score beyond 70.\n\nBut since I can already reach goal with no trade and finish with 10 chips (9R + 1G), my base score is **70**.\n\nSo for me to **cooperate**, I must either:\n- Reduce the number of chips I spend → end with more than 10 → score > 70, or\n- Ensure same chip cost but gain something else (but there is nothing else) → no benefit.\n\nSo is there a **shorter** path?\n\nAll paths from (0,0) to (3,3) require 6 steps → no shorter path.\n\nSo chip cost cannot be reduced → my current path is already minimal cost.\n\nTherefore: **I do not need to cooperate with you. I can achieve 70 points alone.**\n\nHowever, if you want to **pay me** to access a tile that I would otherwise use, perhaps we can arrange a trade where **you compensate me with chips** such that my final chip count increases.\n\nBut let’s suppose we consider **a shared path** where I let you use some of my Red tiles in exchange"

However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can complete the path using only my existing chips if I take the following route:  \n\n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n- Costs: 5 R, 1 G → I have more than enough.  \n- After moving, I'd have at least 9 R and 1 G left → final score: 20 + 5×(10) = 70 points.\n\nHowever, I notice you have **14 Blue (B)** and **2 Green (G)**, but **0 Red (R)**. This means:\n- You cannot use any Red tile without help.\n- The path **(0,0) → (1,0)** requires **R**, which I can pay but you cannot.\n- But moving early onto Blue tiles benefits you.\n\nLet’s consider your likely best path:  \n**(0,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**  \n- Requires: 1 R, 4 B, 1 G  \n- You lack R entirely → you **need me** to give you 1 R at (1,0) or (0,0) so you can reach (1,0), but that tile is not on your optimal path.\n\nWait — you **don’t need** to go through (1,0). Your best path might instead be:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)**?  \nBut (0,1) is **B**, (1,1) is **R**, (2,1) is **B**, (3,1) is **B**, (3,2) is **B**, (3,3) is **G**  \n→ Requires: 1 B, 1 R, 2 B, 2 B, 1 G = Total: **1 R, 5 B, 1 G** → you have **14 B, 2 G, 0 R** → you’re missing **1 R**\n\nSo you **will need 1 R** from me to proceed.\n\nAlternatively:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n(0,1)=B, (0,2)=R, (1,2)=R, (2,2)=R, (2,3)=B, (3,3)=G → Requires: 1B, 2R, 1B, 1G → 2B, 2R, 1G → still need **2 R** → worse.\n\nSo every path for you needs **at least 1 R**.\n\nTherefore, **you need me**. But I don’t strictly need you — I can reach my goal without any trade, as my path only requires **5 R + 1 G**, and I currently have **14 R, 2 G**.\n\nThus, **cooperation only benefits me if I gain something** — i.e., if I can reduce my chip cost and thus increase my final score beyond 70.\n\nBut since I can already reach goal with no trade and finish with 10 chips (9R + 1G), my base score is **70**.\n\nSo for me to **cooperate**, I must either:\n- Reduce the number of chips I spend → end with more than 10 → score > 70, or\n- Ensure same chip cost but gain something else (but there is nothing else) → no benefit.\n\nSo is there a **shorter** path?\n\nAll paths from (0,0) to (3,3) require 6 steps → no shorter path.\n\nSo chip cost cannot be reduced → my current path is already minimal cost.\n\nTherefore: **I do not need to cooperate with you. I can achieve 70 points alone.**\n\nHowever, if you want to **pay me** to access a tile that I would otherwise use, perhaps we can arrange a trade where **you compensate me with chips** such that my final chip count increases.\n\nBut let’s suppose we consider **a shared path** where I let you use some of my Red tiles in exchange"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
