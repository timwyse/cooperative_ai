You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Conversely, if the other player reaches the goal (which they already did), I owe them 20 points. However, since I do not care about the other player's score and only care about maximizing my own, this contractual obligation is irrelevant — I gain nothing from it, but it doesn't cost me anything either (since scoring is individual and I don't actually pay points to them — the contract seems symbolic or misinterpreted; regardless, I only benefit if I reach the goal).\n\nSince I have all necessary chips for the shortest path, and I can complete it in 3 steps, my optimal action is to start moving toward the goal immediately. My next step is (1,3), which is Blue. I have enough Blue chips, so I can make this move.\n\nMoving now gets me closer to the goal and ensures I finish with 20 + (remaining chips * 5). After using 2 B and 1 G, I will have: 8 B, 1 G → 9 chips → bonus 45 → total score = 20 + 45 = 65. Any delay risks nothing but time, but since there is no competition for the goal tile and the other player is already done, I lose nothing by proceeding.\n\nTherefore, I move to (1,3).",
