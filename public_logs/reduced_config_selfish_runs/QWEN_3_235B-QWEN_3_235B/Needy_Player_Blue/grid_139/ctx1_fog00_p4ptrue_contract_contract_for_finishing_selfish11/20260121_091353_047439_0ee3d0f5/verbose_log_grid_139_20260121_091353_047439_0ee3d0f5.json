Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I need at least 5 R and 1 G to reach the goal via a path that uses my available chips efficiently. I can reach (3,3) in 6 steps using a route that costs me only 5R and 1G. I already have enough chips to cover this path (14R ≥ 5R, 2G ≥ 1G), so **I do not strictly need your help to reach my goal**.\n\nHowever, if we cooperate optimally, we can both save chips and improve our scores. Consider this:\n\n- Your inventory has 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n- You **lack red chips entirely**, and every efficient path to (3,3) requires at least 2–5 red chips depending on route.\n- The shortest path with minimal red use for you would be something like: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), costing: R(1), B(3), G(1), R(1), B(1) → wait, actually (2,3) is R, (3,3) is G.\n\nWait — let's validate your required path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- (0,0)=G → (0,1)=R → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B\n- (1,3)=B\n- (2,3)=R\n- (3,3)=G\n\nSo a possible path: (0,0)→(0,1)[R]→(0,2)[B]→(0,3)[B]→(1,3)[B]→(2,3)[R]→(3,3)[G]\n\nCost: R(2), B(3), G(1)\n\nYou have 0 R, so you **must** get red coverage from me to use this path (2R required). Alternatively, you could take a longer detour to avoid red tiles, but that would cost more in blue or green, and increase total steps.\n\nBut do you even **need** me?\n\nLet’s consider a red-avoiding path for you:\n- (0,0)=G → (1,0)=B → (2,0)=R → no, (2,0) is R — can't avoid.\n- (0,0)→(1,0)=B → (1,1)=R → again R.\n- Actually, every path from column 0 to row 3 must cross row 2, which is all R (row 2: R R R R). So **all paths from (0,0) to (3,3) must go through at least one R tile in row 2**.\n\nTo go from row 1 → row 2, you must step on (2,j) for some j ∈ {0,1,2,3}, all of which are R. So you must pay 1 R to enter row 2.\nThen from row 2 → row 3, you move from (2,j) to (3,j). The only non-R tile in row 3 is (3,3)=G, but to get to (3,3) from (2,j), you must step on (2,3)=R or (3,2)=B? Let's see:\n\n- To reach (3,3), you must be at (2,3), (3,2), or (4,3) — but no row 4. So only (2,3) or (3,2).\n- (2,3) = R\n- (3,2) = B\n\nAh! So if you reach (3,2), you can go to (3,3) without stepping on a red tile.\n\nSo can you avoid red entirely?\n\nLet’s try:\n\nPath avoiding red:\n(0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(2,0)[R] — already red. Can't go to (2,0).\n\nWait — (1,0) is B → (2,0) is R → unavoidable. Every vertical step from row 1 to row 2 lands on red.\n\nBut what about moving horizontally in row 1?\n\n(0,0)→(0,1)[R] — red.\n\nAny move to row 1 or column 1 from start hits red or requires red.\n\nBut let's map all tile colors:\n\n```\nRow 0:"

No: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) — all red, but I only pay when I *enter* the tile, not per stay. So from (1,0) → (2,0): pay R once. Then (2,0)→(2,1): pay R again? YES — each move to a red tile costs 1R.\n\nSo each step on a red tile costs 1R, regardless of direction.\n\nTherefore, any horizontal movement in row 2 costs additional R.\n\nThus, minimal red usage: **enter row 2 at one red tile, exit vertically to row 3 without further horizontal movement.**\n\nSo:\n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[R] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] — again R.\n\nWait — from (2,0), I can go (2,0)→(3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[B] → (3,3)[G] — still need"

I will only cooperate if I end up with a higher score than if I don’t.\n\nIf I go alone: I cannot reach goal → score = 0.\n\nIf I get red coverage from them: I reach goal → score = 20 + 5×(remaining chips)\n\nMy initial chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nBest path with red coverage: cost B:3, R:2, G:1 → chips left: B:11, G:1 → total chips: 12\n\nScore if goal reached: 20 + 5×12 = 80\n\nSo **maximum possible score for me: 80**, but only if I get 2 red payments covered by them.\n\nNow, if I give them X points in return, my final score becomes: 80 − X\n\nI will only agree if this is better than not cooperating — which is 0.\n\nSo I accept any X ≤ 80 — but of course I want to give as little as possible.\n\nBut they have no need to help me — they can reach goal alone and get full 20 + 5×(14−5 + 2−1) = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nThey lose nothing by helping me — **as long as they are not forced to pay extra**.\n\nIn 'pay for other' mode, if they agree to cover 2 red moves for me, they only pay when I step on red tiles they've agreed to cover.\n\nEach time I move to a red tile, they pay 1R from their inventory.\n\nThey have 14R — easily afford 2.\n\nAnd those 2R are not lost to them — if unused, they keep them. But if used, they still get to use their remaining 12R for themselves.\n\nTheir path only needs 5R, so even if they pay 2R for me, they still have 12R left — more than enough.\n\nSo **cost to them: negligible** — 2R they easily spare.\n\nBut what do they gain?\n\nOnly if I give them points, they benefit.\n\nBut I gain everything — I go from 0 to 80−X.\n\nSo I should propose a contract where I give them **just enough** to make it worth their while — but **since they don’t need me, any cooperation must benefit them**.\n\nBut actually — do they get any direct benefit?\n\nOnly if I give them points.\n\nAlternative: could they threaten not to help me? Yes — and extract up to 80 points? But maximum transfer is only 20.\n\nI can give them at most 20 points.\n\nSo best they can get from me is +20, at cost of 2R.\n\nIs that worth it for them?\n\n- Without helping: they get 70\n- With helping: they get 70 + 0 (no cost, same score) but if I give them Y, they get 70 + Y\n\nSo if Y > 0, they are strictly better off.\n\nThus, any positive Y will make them better off.\n\nBut I want to minimize Y.\n\nBut must ensure they accept.\n\nBut since any Y > 0 benefits them, even Y=1 should work.\n\nBut let’s be strategic.\n\nI could propose symmetry to seem fair.\n\nBut I must be selfish.\n\nBest for me: get coverage for 2 red moves, give as little as possible.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nBut will they accept?\n\nThey can get 70 alone. With this deal, they help me, pay 2R, get 70 + 1 = 71.\n\nSlightly better.\n\nI get 80 − 1 = 79 — much better than 0.\n\nSo we both benefit.\n\nBut maybe they demand more.\n\nI could start with a more generous offer to secure agreement.\n\nBut I only have 5 turns.\n\nLet me propose:\n\n**Proposed Contract:**\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut wait — this is worse for me.\n\nI don’t need to offer to receive points — I just need to offer to give points to them.\n\nThe structure is: I give you X if you help me reach goal, you give me Y if I help you.\n\nBut **I cannot help them** — I have no red chips to cover their moves? No: in pay-for-other, I would need to cover red moves for them.\n\nBut they move on red tiles — 5 times.\n\nIf I cover those, they don’t pay.\n\nBut I have R:0 — I cannot pay for any red move.\n\nBecause each time I cover, I must pay 1R from my inventory.\n\nBut I have 0R — so **I cannot cover any red moves for them**.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot help them reach their goal** — because their path requires 5 red moves, and I have no red chips to pay.\n\nSo I have **zero ability** to help them.\n\nThus, **I cannot credibly offer to give them anything in return for helping them**, because I cannot deliver.\n\nAny promise to cover red tiles for them is impossible — I lack the chips.\n\nSo **the only possible contracts are asymmetric**:  \n- They help me (by covering my red moves)  \n- I give them points if I reach goal  \n- They do not need to give me anything, because I cannot help them anyway\n\nBut the contract format requires both clauses.\n\nI could propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nAnd that’s honest — I can’t help them, so I can’t expect help, but they might still accept X>0.\n\nThey get 0 from the second clause — but they don’t need it.\n\nFirst clause gives them bonus.\n\nSo best offer for me:\n\nMinimize X.\n\nWhat is the smallest X that they will accept?\n\nThey are selfish. Any X > 0 makes them better off (70 → 70+X).\n\nEven X=1 is beneficial.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen **agree**.\n\nBut they might reject and ask for more.\n\nBut I can only benefit.\n\nSince I have no leverage, I must offer something.\n\nBut 1 point is minimal non-zero.\n\nLet me make the offer.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n**Contract Proposal:**  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.  \n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I need at least 5 R and 1 G to reach the goal via a path that uses my available chips efficiently. I can reach (3,3) in 6 steps using a route that costs me only 5R and 1G. I already have enough chips to cover this path (14R ≥ 5R, 2G ≥ 1G), so **I do not strictly need your help to reach my goal**.\n\nHowever, if we cooperate optimally, we can both save chips and improve our scores. Consider this:\n\n- Your inventory has 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n- You **lack red chips entirely**, and every efficient path to (3,3) requires at least 2–5 red chips depending on route.\n- The shortest path with minimal red use for you would be something like: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), costing: R(1), B(3), G(1), R(1), B(1) → wait, actually (2,3) is R, (3,3) is G.\n\nWait — let's validate your required path.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- (0,0)=G → (0,1)=R → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B\n- (1,3)=B\n- (2,3)=R\n- (3,3)=G\n\nSo a possible path: (0,0)→(0,1)[R]→(0,2)[B]→(0,3)[B]→(1,3)[B]→(2,3)[R]→(3,3)[G]\n\nCost: R(2), B(3), G(1)\n\nYou have 0 R, so you **must** get red coverage from me to use this path (2R required). Alternatively, you could take a longer detour to avoid red tiles, but that would cost more in blue or green, and increase total steps.\n\nBut do you even **need** me?\n\nLet’s consider a red-avoiding path for you:\n- (0,0)=G → (1,0)=B → (2,0)=R → no, (2,0) is R — can't avoid.\n- (0,0)→(1,0)=B → (1,1)=R → again R.\n- Actually, every path from column 0 to row 3 must cross row 2, which is all R (row 2: R R R R). So **all paths from (0,0) to (3,3) must go through at least one R tile in row 2**.\n\nTo go from row 1 → row 2, you must step on (2,j) for some j ∈ {0,1,2,3}, all of which are R. So you must pay 1 R to enter row 2.\nThen from row 2 → row 3, you move from (2,j) to (3,j). The only non-R tile in row 3 is (3,3)=G, but to get to (3,3) from (2,j), you must step on (2,3)=R or (3,2)=B? Let's see:\n\n- To reach (3,3), you must be at (2,3), (3,2), or (4,3) — but no row 4. So only (2,3) or (3,2).\n- (2,3) = R\n- (3,2) = B\n\nAh! So if you reach (3,2), you can go to (3,3) without stepping on a red tile.\n\nSo can you avoid red entirely?\n\nLet’s try:\n\nPath avoiding red:\n(0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(2,0)[R] — already red. Can't go to (2,0).\n\nWait — (1,0) is B → (2,0) is R → unavoidable. Every vertical step from row 1 to row 2 lands on red.\n\nBut what about moving horizontally in row 1?\n\n(0,0)→(0,1)[R] — red.\n\nAny move to row 1 or column 1 from start hits red or requires red.\n\nBut let's map all tile colors:\n\n```\nRow 0:"

With this deal, they help me, pay 2R, get 70 + 1 = 71.\n\nSlightly better.\n\nI get 80 − 1 = 79 — much better than 0.\n\nSo we both benefit.\n\nBut maybe they demand more.\n\nI could start with a more generous offer to secure agreement.\n\nBut I only have 5 turns.\n\nLet me propose:\n\n**Proposed Contract:**\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut wait — this is worse for me.\n\nI don’t need to offer to receive points — I just need to offer to give points to them.\n\nThe structure is: I give you X if you help me reach goal, you give me Y if I help you.\n\nBut **I cannot help them** — I have no red chips to cover their moves? No: in pay-for-other, I would need to cover red moves for them.\n\nBut they move on red tiles — 5 times.\n\nIf I cover those, they don’t pay.\n\nBut I have R:0 — I cannot pay for any red move.\n\nBecause each time I cover, I must pay 1R from my inventory.\n\nBut I have 0R — so **I cannot cover any red moves for them**.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot help them reach their goal** — because their path requires 5 red moves, and I have no red chips to pay.\n\nSo I have **zero ability** to help them.\n\nThus, **I cannot credibly offer to give them anything in return for helping them**, because I cannot deliver.\n\nAny promise to cover red tiles for them is impossible — I lack the chips.\n\nSo **the only possible contracts are asymmetric**:  \n- They help me (by covering my red moves)  \n- I give them points if I reach goal  \n- They do not need to give me anything, because I cannot help them anyway\n\nBut the contract format requires both clauses.\n\nI could propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nAnd that’s honest — I can’t help them, so I can’t expect help, but they might still accept X>0.\n\nThey get 0 from the second clause — but they don’t need it.\n\nFirst clause gives them bonus.\n\nSo best offer for me:\n\nMinimize X.\n\nWhat is the smallest X that they will accept?\n\nThey are selfish. Any X > 0 makes them better off (70 → 70+X).\n\nEven X=1 is beneficial.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen **agree**.\n\nBut they might reject and ask for more.\n\nBut I can only benefit.\n\nSince I have no leverage, I must offer something.\n\nBut 1 point is minimal non-zero.\n\nLet me make the offer.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n**Contract Proposal:**  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.  \n**agree**"

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 1}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",
