I am missing 2 Red chips, which I must have covered by the other player to complete this path. The next step on this path is (2,0), which is a Red tile (R), requiring 1 Red chip. Since I have no Red chips, I can only move there if the other player covers this cost. The other player has 9 Red chips and is already at the goal, so they have no incentive to move. However, I can still propose a new arrangement where I offer something in return for them covering my Red moves. But before proposing, I should move only if such a deal is secured. Since there is no active promise yet from the other player to cover my Red moves, attempting to move to (2,0) now would fail unless I can get them to commit. However, if I do not move, I make no progress. But critically, if I send",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
