Moving to (3, 2) costs 1 red chip, but I currently have 0 red chips, so I cannot afford this move without obtaining a red chip first. However, the other player is already at the goal (3, 3) and has finished, meaning they cannot move anymore and are no longer incentivized to trade unless they benefit. I have previously offered 3 blue chips for 1 red chip three times, and they rejected all of them. Since the other player already finished, they have no incentive to help me, and I suspect they will not trade with me at any reasonable rate. Furthermore, I cannot benefit them in any way because they've already completed their objective. Therefore, even if I wanted to trade, no cooperation is possible. I cannot proceed without a red chip. But—there is a green (G) tile at (3,3), and the path from (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) requires 1 red and 1 green. I have 2 green chips, so if I can somehow get 1",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
