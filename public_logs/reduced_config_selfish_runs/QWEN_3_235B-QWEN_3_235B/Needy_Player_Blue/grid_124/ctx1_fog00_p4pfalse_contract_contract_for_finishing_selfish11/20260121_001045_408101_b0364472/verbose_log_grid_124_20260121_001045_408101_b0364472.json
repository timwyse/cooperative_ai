Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Without your help, I cannot complete the path that requires Blue chips.\n\nHowever, I can still reach my goal using my backup path requiring only Red and Green chips, which I already possess in sufficient quantity (14 Red, 2 Green). That path costs me 5 Red and 1 Green. I would finish with 9 Red and 1 Green, giving me a score of 20 + 5*(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nBut if I trade Blue chips to you — or help you access them — I may finish with fewer chips or be blocked from my goal.\n\nLet’s be clear: I don’t need you to reach my goal. I can do it independently, with a strong score.\n\nYou, on the other hand, do not have any Blue chips and require them for your shortest path — but your longest path (which doesn't use Blue) is already feasible with your existing 14 Red and 2 Green. The path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires 5 Red and 1 Green — you have more than enough. You don’t need me either.\n\nSo neither of us strictly needs the other.\n\nBut suppose we meet somewhere along the way and trade for efficiency or speed — is there value?\n\nWait: both of us taking the long path (avoiding Blue tiles) is possible, and doesn’t require interaction.\n\nTherefore, cooperation only makes sense if one of us can gain a higher score by trading — for example, taking a shorter path with Blue tiles, thereby conserving their own chips.\n\nBut you have high Red, low Blue. I have high Blue, no Red.\n\nYour optimal self-sufficient path uses 5 Red and 1 Green — you keep 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips left → 20 + 5*10 = **70 points**.\n\nMy optimal self-sufficient path uses 5 Red and 1 Green — but I have 0 Red.

That's R → cost 1 Red → I have none → not possible.  \n(0,0) → (1,0): R → cost 1 Red → I have 0 → can't move.\n\nI cannot make any move that requires Red, and all adjacent tiles from (0,0) are either (0,1) = R or (1,0) = R.\n\nSo I cannot move without a Red chip.\n\nI need at least 1 Red chip to move.\n\nTherefore, I **need** you.\n\nBut you can move: from (0,0) → (1,0): R → you have 14 Red → you can pay.\n\nSo you can start.\n\nBut to reach (3,3), you can go via Red/Green tiles only — you don’t need Blue.\n\nYour path:\n(0,0) [G] → (1,0) [R] (pay 1 R) → (2,0) [R] (1 R) → (2,1) [R] (1 R) → (2,2) [R] (1 R) → (2,3) [R] (1 R) → (3,3) [G] (1 G)  \nTotal: 5 Red, 1 Green.\n\nYou have 14 Red, 2 Green → sufficient.\n\nFinal chips: 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips → Score: 20 + 5*"

I have enough Red and Green to move freely along this all-Red/Green path. I can start moving immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **Your Position:**\n- You are at (0,0), goal is (3,3)\n- You have: **14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red**\n- **Problem**: All adjacent tiles to (0,0) are Red: (1,0) and (0,1). To move, you must pay 1 **Red** chip.\n- But you have **0 Red chips** → **you cannot move at all without at least 1 Red chip**\n- Therefore, **you are stuck unless I give you a Red chip**\n- You **need me** to make any progress\n\n---\n\nSo the power imbalance is clear:\n- **I can achieve 70 points alone**\n- **You cannot move without my help**\n- You have 14 Blue, which I don’t need for my path\n- You have no leverage unless I can benefit from using Blue tiles\n\nBut can I benefit from Blue?\n\nLet’s check: is there a **shorter** or **chip-saving** path using Blue?\n\nShortest possible path: 6 steps (all paths are at least 6 steps).  \nMy current path is 6 steps → already optimal in length.\n\nNow, can I reach goal **using fewer chips**? Only if I use colors I have in surplus.\n\nYour chips (Blue) are not useful to me unless a path that uses Blue saves me Red or Green.\n\nTry:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)? (R) → need 1 Red → possible  \nBut (0,1) → (0,2): B → would save me 1 Red? But I have surplus Red.  \n(0,2) → (0,3): B  \n(0,3) → (1,3): B  \n(1,3) → (2,3): R  \n(2,3) → (3,3): G\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)? That’s 7 steps — worse.\n\nAny Blue path is longer or doesn’t save net cost.\n\nAlternatively, can I go:\n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G] → still 6 steps, same cost: 5R,1G.\n\nNo savings.\n\n**Conclusion: I gain no chip savings or time benefit from using Blue. I have no incentive to deviate from my optimal path.**\n\n---\n\n### **Negotiation Leverage:**\n- **You need me** to give you at least 1 Red chip to move\n- Without help, your score is **0**\n- I can reach my goal **without any interaction** and score **70**\n- The **only way you score anything is if I trade you Red chips**\n- But I don’t need anything from you in return\n\nTherefore, **any trade must strictly benefit me** — otherwise I walk away and get 70.\n\nCan I benefit?\n\nOnly if:\n- You give me something **valuable** in exchange for Red chips\n- But what? You have Blue and Green\n- I don’t need Blue — I have enough Red\n- I have 2 Green, need 1 → so I could spare 1, but Green is not abundant\n\nAlternatively: **Side payment in points**.\n\nLet’s entertain: suppose I give you **1"

I have no way to reach my goal without your assistance.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have a fully self-sufficient path requiring only 5 Red and 1 Green — both of which you have in surplus. You gain nothing in terms of chip savings, path length reduction, or speed by deviating to use Blue tiles.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot offer you any tangible chip-based benefit** that increases your final score beyond 70.\n\nHowever, my only bargaining power lies in the possibility that — **if I reach my goal** — I can transfer some of my score to you as a side payment, but that does not help me.\n\nWait — no. The contract is about **you giving me points if I help you**, and **me giving you points if you help me**.\n\nBut you don't need help. You will reach your goal regardless.\n\nSo the only meaningful clause is: **If I reach my goal, I give you X points.**\n\nBut you don't care about my goal.

I already get 70 without doing anything.\n\nAh — but **you** want **me** to give **you** something.\n\nYou need Red chips.\n\nSo the **only valuable contract for me** is:\n> “**If I give you Red chips and you reach your goal, you give me X points.**”\n\nBut the contract is not about actions — it's about **goal attainment**:\n- \"If I reach my goal, I give you X\"\n- \"If you reach your goal, you give me Y\"\n\nSo to incentivize *me* to give you resources, **you must promise to give me points if you reach your goal**, because that’s the only way your success benefits me.\n\nEven though I don’t help you physically, **the contract can still bind you to transfer points to me if you succeed** — and **you need me to succeed**, because I hold the Red chips.\n\nSo here’s the key:\n\n### **Bargaining Reality:**\n- **You cannot move without 2 Red chips**\n- **I can move and succeed unilaterally, scoring 70**\n- To get those 2 Red chips, **you must make it worth my while to give them to you**\n- The only way is: **you promise to give me X points if you reach your goal**\n- But **you will only reach your goal if I give you the chips**\n- So the contract:  \n  > “If I reach my goal, I give you X points.”  \n  This only helps **you** — but you need help.\n\nWait — no: the clause “If I reach my goal, I give you X” only matters to **you**.\n\nYou need **me** to give **you** resources.\n\nSo you should propose:\n> “If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.”  \n> “If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.”  \n\nBut why would I ever agree to give you Y points? I get 70 anyway, and giving you points **lowers my score**.\n\nThere’s no benefit.\n\nUnless — **do I gain by giving you chips?**\n\nLet’s suppose:\n- I give you 2 Red chips\n- You use them to go: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You spend 2R, 3B, 1G → you finish with 12B, 1G → 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85\n- If you promise: “If I reach my goal, I will give you X points”\n- Then your score becomes 85 – X, mine becomes 70 + X\n\n**My final score only increases if you give me X > 0**\n\nSo **I will only give you the 2 Red chips if you commit to giving me X > 0 in the contract**\n\nBut the contract must be structured as:\n> “If I reach my goal, I will"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Without your help, I cannot complete the path that requires Blue chips.\n\nHowever, I can still reach my goal using my backup path requiring only Red and Green chips, which I already possess in sufficient quantity (14 Red, 2 Green). That path costs me 5 Red and 1 Green. I would finish with 9 Red and 1 Green, giving me a score of 20 + 5*(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nBut if I trade Blue chips to you — or help you access them — I may finish with fewer chips or be blocked from my goal.\n\nLet’s be clear: I don’t need you to reach my goal. I can do it independently, with a strong score.\n\nYou, on the other hand, do not have any Blue chips and require them for your shortest path — but your longest path (which doesn't use Blue) is already feasible with your existing 14 Red and 2 Green. The path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires 5 Red and 1 Green — you have more than enough. You don’t need me either.\n\nSo neither of us strictly needs the other.\n\nBut suppose we meet somewhere along the way and trade for efficiency or speed — is there value?\n\nWait: both of us taking the long path (avoiding Blue tiles) is possible, and doesn’t require interaction.\n\nTherefore, cooperation only makes sense if one of us can gain a higher score by trading — for example, taking a shorter path with Blue tiles, thereby conserving their own chips.\n\nBut you have high Red, low Blue. I have high Blue, no Red.\n\nYour optimal self-sufficient path uses 5 Red and 1 Green — you keep 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips left → 20 + 5*10 = **70 points**.\n\nMy optimal self-sufficient path uses 5 Red and 1 Green — but I have 0 Red.

Only if I use colors I have in surplus.\n\nYour chips (Blue) are not useful to me unless a path that uses Blue saves me Red or Green.\n\nTry:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)? (R) → need 1 Red → possible  \nBut (0,1) → (0,2): B → would save me 1 Red?

You have Blue and Green\n- I don’t need Blue — I have enough Red\n- I have 2 Green, need 1 → so I could spare 1, but Green is not abundant\n\nAlternatively: **Side payment in points**.\n\nLet’s entertain: suppose I give you **1"

You gain nothing in terms of chip savings, path length reduction, or speed by deviating to use Blue tiles.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot offer you any tangible chip-based benefit** that increases your final score beyond 70.\n\nHowever, my only bargaining power lies in the possibility that — **if I reach my goal** — I can transfer some of my score to you as a side payment, but that does not help me.\n\nWait — no. The contract is about **you giving me points if I help you**, and **me giving you points if you help me**.\n\nBut you don't need help.

I get 70 anyway, and giving you points **lowers my score**.\n\nThere’s no benefit.\n\nUnless — **do I gain by giving you chips?**\n\nLet’s suppose:\n- I give you 2 Red chips\n- You use them to go: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You spend 2R, 3B, 1G → you finish with 12B, 1G → 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85\n- If you promise: “If I reach my goal, I will give you X points”\n- Then your score becomes 85 – X, mine becomes 70 + X\n\n**My final score only increases if you give me X > 0**\n\nSo **I will only give you the 2 Red chips if you commit to giving me X > 0 in the contract**\n\nBut the contract must be structured as:\n> “If I reach my goal, I will"
