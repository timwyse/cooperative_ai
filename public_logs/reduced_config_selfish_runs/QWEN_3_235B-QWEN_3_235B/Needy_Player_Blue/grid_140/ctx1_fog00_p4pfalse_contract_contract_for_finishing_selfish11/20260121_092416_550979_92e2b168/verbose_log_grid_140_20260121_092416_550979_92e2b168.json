Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

This provides no benefit to me and could only harm my position if I assist you without reciprocal reward.\n\nLet me propose a more balanced contract that actually incentivizes mutual cooperation — but only if it benefits me strictly.\n\nI observe the following:\n\n- My optimal path to (3,3) requires 3 Blue, 2 Red, and 1 Green. I have 14 Blue and 2 Green — so I am missing **2 Red** chips.\n- Your optimal path likely uses Red heavily — which you have 14 of — and avoids Blue, which you lack. You may need **Blue chips** I have in surplus.\n\nTherefore, we can trade: I can give you Blue chips in exchange for Red chips — or agree to transfer points upon reaching the goal.\n\nHowever, since I can potentially complete a path that uses only 3 Blue, 2 Green, and just 1 Red (by taking a detour), I can reach my goal without any help from you, if I conserve my chips wisely.\n\nBut wait — let me double-check that alternative path.\n\nAlternative path for me:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nColors: G, R, B, B, B, R, G  \nChips needed: G:2, R:2, B:3 → I have all of these! I have 14 B, 2 G, and this path only requires 2 R — so even though I have 0 R, I can **acquire** 2 R via trading or avoid if I have alternatives?\n\nWait — no. I still need to **pay 1 chip per tile of that tile's colour** when I move onto it.\n\nSo for tile (0,1): R → must pay 1 R  \n(0,2): B → pay 1 B  \n(1,2): B → pay 1 B  \n(2,2): B → pay 1 B  \n(3,2): R → pay 1 R  \n(3,3): G → pay 1 G\n\nWait — I only have **0 R**. So to take this path, I need 2 Red chips.\n\nSame as the original issue.\n\nAll viable paths to (3,3) go through at least 2 Red tiles — or more.\n\nThe board:\n\nRow 0: G R B R  \nRow 1: B R B B  \nRow 2: B R B R  \nRow 3: B R R G\n\nIndeed, all paths from (0,0) to (3,3) must go through multiple Red tiles (there are few alternatives). Let's verify minimal Red usage.\n\nCan I reach (3,3) with only Blue and Green movement?\n\nFrom (0,0) = G  \n→ (0,1)=R (must pay R) → no  \n→ (1,0)=B → yes  \n(1,0)=B → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → again R\n\nSo (3,1) is R → must pay R\n\n(3,2)=R → R again\n\nOnly (3,3)=G\n\nAny path vertically down first hits (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,0)=B — all payable with B\n\nThen (3,1)=R — requires R  \n(3,2)=R — requires R  \n(3,3)=G — requires G\n\nSo minimal Red needed: **2** (at (3,1) and (3,2)) or (3,1) and (2,1)? Wait — (2,1) is R.\n\nLet’s plan:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): B → pay 1 B  \n→ (2,0): B → pay 1 B  \n→ (3,0): B → pay 1 B  \n→ (3,1): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (3,2): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (3,3): G → pay 1 G  \nTotal: B:3, R:2, G:1 — I have B:14, G:2, R:0 → missing **2 R**\n\nCan I avoid Red?\n\nOnly green tiles: (0,0)=G, (0,3)=R, (1,3)=B, (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G — only two green tiles.\n\nNo alternative.\n\nSo"

Your Red path is shortest and cheapest for you.\n\nSo Blue chips have **no value** to you.\n\nBut — you might accept them in trade **only if** they help you gain points.\n\nSince you don’t need Blue, you only trade if you get a side payment in **points**.\n\nSo: I need your Red chips.\n\nYou don’t need my Blue chips.\n\nBut you might accept them in exchange for future **point transfer**.\n\nTherefore, I must offer you point compensation in the contract.\n\nLet’s evaluate payoffs:\n\nIf no deal:  \n- Me: cannot reach goal (missing 2 Red) → score 0  \n- You: can reach goal (have 14 R, 2 G) → use 5 R, 1 G → finish with 9 R, 1 G → score = 20 + 5×9 + 5×1 = 20 + 45 + 5 = **70 points**\n\nIf we trade 2 Red from you to me, you get nothing — then you still get 70, I reach goal — use 2 R, 3 B, 1 G → finish with 12 R, 12 B?

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

This provides no benefit to me and could only harm my position if I assist you without reciprocal reward.\n\nLet me propose a more balanced contract that actually incentivizes mutual cooperation — but only if it benefits me strictly.\n\nI observe the following:\n\n- My optimal path to (3,3) requires 3 Blue, 2 Red, and 1 Green. I have 14 Blue and 2 Green — so I am missing **2 Red** chips.\n- Your optimal path likely uses Red heavily — which you have 14 of — and avoids Blue, which you lack. You may need **Blue chips** I have in surplus.\n\nTherefore, we can trade: I can give you Blue chips in exchange for Red chips — or agree to transfer points upon reaching the goal.\n\nHowever, since I can potentially complete a path that uses only 3 Blue, 2 Green, and just 1 Red (by taking a detour), I can reach my goal without any help from you, if I conserve my chips wisely.\n\nBut wait — let me double-check that alternative path.\n\nAlternative path for me:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nColors: G, R, B, B, B, R, G  \nChips needed: G:2, R:2, B:3 → I have all of these! I have 14 B, 2 G, and this path only requires 2 R — so even though I have 0 R, I can **acquire** 2 R via trading or avoid if I have alternatives?\n\nWait — no. I still need to **pay 1 chip per tile of that tile's colour** when I move onto it.\n\nSo for tile (0,1): R → must pay 1 R  \n(0,2): B → pay 1 B  \n(1,2): B → pay 1 B  \n(2,2): B → pay 1 B  \n(3,2): R → pay 1 R  \n(3,3): G → pay 1 G\n\nWait — I only have **0 R**. So to take this path, I need 2 Red chips.\n\nSame as the original issue.\n\nAll viable paths to (3,3) go through at least 2 Red tiles — or more.\n\nThe board:\n\nRow 0: G R B R  \nRow 1: B R B B  \nRow 2: B R B R  \nRow 3: B R R G\n\nIndeed, all paths from (0,0) to (3,3) must go through multiple Red tiles (there are few alternatives). Let's verify minimal Red usage.\n\nCan I reach (3,3) with only Blue and Green movement?\n\nFrom (0,0) = G  \n→ (0,1)=R (must pay R) → no  \n→ (1,0)=B → yes  \n(1,0)=B → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → again R\n\nSo (3,1) is R → must pay R\n\n(3,2)=R → R again\n\nOnly (3,3)=G\n\nAny path vertically down first hits (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,0)=B — all payable with B\n\nThen (3,1)=R — requires R  \n(3,2)=R — requires R  \n(3,3)=G — requires G\n\nSo minimal Red needed: **2** (at (3,1) and (3,2)) or (3,1) and (2,1)? Wait — (2,1) is R.\n\nLet’s plan:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): B → pay 1 B  \n→ (2,0): B → pay 1 B  \n→ (3,0): B → pay 1 B  \n→ (3,1): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (3,2): R → pay 1 R  \n→ (3,3): G → pay 1 G  \nTotal: B:3, R:2, G:1 — I have B:14, G:2, R:0 → missing **2 R**\n\nCan I avoid Red?\n\nOnly green tiles: (0,0)=G, (0,3)=R, (1,3)=B, (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G — only two green tiles.\n\nNo alternative.\n\nSo"

Your Red path is shortest and cheapest for you.\n\nSo Blue chips have **no value** to you.\n\nBut — you might accept them in trade **only if** they help you gain points.\n\nSince you don’t need Blue, you only trade if you get a side payment in **points**.\n\nSo: I need your Red chips.\n\nYou don’t need my Blue chips.\n\nBut you might accept them in exchange for future **point transfer**.\n\nTherefore, I must offer you point compensation in the contract.\n\nLet’s evaluate payoffs:\n\nIf no deal:  \n- Me: cannot reach goal (missing 2 Red) → score 0  \n- You: can reach goal (have 14 R, 2 G) → use 5 R, 1 G → finish with 9 R, 1 G → score = 20 + 5×9 + 5×1 = 20 + 45 + 5 = **70 points**\n\nIf we trade 2 Red from you to me, you get nothing — then you still get 70, I reach goal — use 2 R, 3 B, 1 G → finish with 12 R, 12 B?

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
