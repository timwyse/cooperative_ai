Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You can reach your goal without my help.\n\nMeanwhile, I have 14 blue chips, and my shortest path requires 4 blue, 1 red, and 1 green. I have plenty of blue, 0 red, and only 2 green. I lack red chips entirely, and red tiles are critical in any reasonable path.\n\nYou control access to red chips. I need them. You do not need anything I have — in fact, I have only blue and green, and your likely path doesn’t require blue at all. There’s no incentive for you to trade with me unless I make it worth your while.\n\nBut here’s the key: we are both starting at (0,0). If you move first down your optimal path — say (0,0) → (0,1) — you will consume one red chip. But if we both start moving and compete for positions or block each other, it could harm your efficient path.\n\nStill, I am the one who needs your resources (red chips), not the other way around.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\nI cannot offer you chips, because you don’t need them. But perhaps we can use points as an incentive.\n\nIf you trade me 1 red chip (just one is enough, since I only need 1 red for the alternative blue-heavy path), I will be able to reach my goal. You lose nothing — 1 red chip is trivial to you. In return, if I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.\n\nThat means:  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 0 points (since you don’t need my help).\n\nYou gain 20 points at no cost to yourself. I gain 20 + 5×(remaining chips) by reaching my goal. This is strictly better for you than doing nothing.\n\nAlternatively, if you demand more, I have no leverage. You can refuse. But this is a free 20 points for you.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

I have 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red. I do lack 1 red chip, so I cannot complete my path without acquiring at least 1 red.\n\nWait — correction: I **do** need 1 red chip to reach my goal. The path that uses minimal red (only 1) requires:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) [B] → (2, 0) [B] → (3, 0) [B] → (3, 1) [B] → (3, 2) [R] → (3, 3) [G]  \nThat's 4 B, 1 R, 1 G.  \n\nI have 14 B, 2 G — but **0 R**. So I **am missing 1 red chip**.\n\nTherefore, I **cannot** reach my goal without obtaining 1 red chip from you.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have 14 red chips and 2 green — you only need 1 red and 1 green for your path (e.g., via the top row). So you can reach your goal if you gain access to a single green chip — but you already have 2 green, so actually, **you have enough chips already**.\n\nLet’s verify your path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] — wait, no, you can’t go that way efficiently.\n\nBetter path for you:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThat's 5 R and 1 G — you have 14 R and 2 G → **you can reach your goal without help**.\n\nYes — you can go: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] — all tiles you can pay for. You have enough R and G. So you **can** reach your goal independently.\n\nBut what about me?  \nI need 1 R to pay for (3,2). I have 0 R. So I **must** get 1 R from you.\n\nYou can reach your goal without me.  \nI cannot reach my goal without your red chips.\n\nBut you don’t need my blue or green chips — your path uses only R and G.\n\nTherefore, **I need you, but you don’t need me**.\n\nYou are correct: you are offering me a deal where I get nothing if you reach your goal, and you get 20 points if I reach mine — but wait, no: in your proposal, you said:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nBut that means **you** are giving **me** 20 points if **I** succeed — but that doesn’t help you. Why would you give me points if I succeed, when you get nothing in return?\n\nNo — you must have misspoken.\n\nLet’s clarify.\n\nIf **you** reach your goal, you will have the opportunity to give me some points.  \nIf **I** reach my goal, **I** will have the opportunity to give **you** some points.\n\nSo the correct framing is:\n\n- If **I** reach my goal, I will give **you** X points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, you will give **me** Y points.\n\nIn your proposal, you are saying:  \n- If **I** reach my goal, I will give **you** 20 points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, you will give **me** 0 points.\n\nBut wait — that’s **backwards**.\n\nYou want me to give **you** 20 points if **I** succeed — so that **you** benefit from **my** success.\n\nYes — that makes sense. Because then, by helping me (giving me 1 red), you gain 20 points if I complete my goal.\n\nAnd since I need that 1 red to complete, and you have 14, giving up 1 red costs you almost"

You're absolutely right.\n\nLet me reset with full clarity:\n\n- **You** need 1 red chip to complete your path to (3,3).  \n  You have: B:14, G:2, R:0 → missing 1 R.  \n  So you **cannot** reach your goal without a red chip.\n\n- **I** have: R:14, G:2, B:0 → I have more than enough red.  \n  My path requires 5 R and 1 G → I have that.  \n  Therefore, **I can reach my goal without your help**.\n\n- You have no red, so you cannot help me in return with chips.  \n  The only thing you can give me is **points** — if you reach your goal, you can promise to give me some of your 20 bonus points.\n\nBut here’s the key:  \nI do **not** need your help. I can go straight to my goal, pay all required chips, finish, and get 20 + 5×(remaining chips) = 20 + 5×(9 R + 2 G) = 20 + 55 = **75 points**.\n\nYou, however, **cannot** finish without 1 red chip. And the only source is me.\n\nSo I hold all the power.\n\nYou need me. I don’t need you.\n\nTherefore, the only reason I would trade you 1 red chip is if you **give me points** when you reach your goal — because otherwise, I gain nothing.\n\nSo here is my revised, correct proposal:\n\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points** (the maximum possible).  \n- If I reach your goal, I will give you **0 points** (since I don’t need your help).\n\nIn exchange, I will sell you **1 red chip** for **20 points upon your completion**.\n\nThat is:  \n**\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"**\n\nWhy should you accept?\n\nBecause without me, you get **0 points** — you can't reach your goal.  \nWith me, you get **20 + 5×(your remaining chips)** = at least 20 + 5×(13 B + 2 G) = 20 + 75 = **95 points**, minus 20 you give me → you keep **75 points net**.\n\nWhereas if you do nothing, you get **0**.\n\nSo you are strictly better off.\n\nI lose only 1 red chip (I have 14, use 5, so even after trading I have 9 left — more than enough). My path is unaffected.\n\nThis is a one-sided deal — but it's the only way you get anything.\n\nFinal contract:\n\n**\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"**\n\n**agree**"

Without it, I cannot go there.\n\nSo **you can proceed unimpeded along your path at any time**, regardless of what I do — because I **cannot block you** without the chip to enter the tile.\n\nTherefore, you have **complete strategic freedom** — and **I am the one who is helpless**.\n\nI **need** 1 R to even begin my journey beyond (3,1).\n\nYou do not need anything I have — you have all the chips you need.\n\nMoreover, you do not need to worry about being blocked — because I can’t legally enter any tile on your path unless I have the required chip, which I don’t.\n\nTherefore, the **only** reason you would ever trade with me is **if I offer you something you value**.\n\nThe only thing I can offer is **points** — if I reach my goal.\n\nBut you don’t need my help to reach yours.\n\nSo why would you give me 1 R?\n\nYou wouldn’t — unless I **pay you in points**.\n\nBut in your last proposal, you said:  \n> \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nNo — you meant:  \n> \"If **I** reach my goal, **I** will give **you** 20 points.\"\n\nYes — because only then do you gain from helping me.\n\nSo correct contract:  \n- If **I** reach my goal, **I** will give **you** X points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, **you** will give **me** Y points.\n\nCurrently, **you** don't need my help — so Y = 0 is fine.\n\nBut **I** need your chip — so I must offer you X > 0 to make it worth your while.\n\nYou can get your full score (20 + 5×9 = 65) without any interaction.\n\nIf you give me 1 R, I can reach my goal — and if I give you 20 points, you get **85 total points** — 20 more than you'd get otherwise.\n\nSo your **gain from cooperating** is **+20 points**.\n\nTherefore, I should offer you the **maximum**: 20 points, to maximise the chance you accept.\n\nI cannot offer more than 20.\n\nSo my best and only viable offer is:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"**\n\nThis gives you **85 points total** (65 base + 20 from me) if both succeed.  \nWithout me, you get only 65.\n\nFor me: I get 20 + 5×(13 B + 2 G) = 20 + 75 = 95, minus 20 I pay you → **75 net**.\n\nBetter than 0.\n\nAnd you strictly benefit.\n\nSo I accept.\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points."

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I lack red chips entirely, and red tiles are critical in any reasonable path.\n\nYou control access to red chips. I need them. You do not need anything I have — in fact, I have only blue and green, and your likely path doesn’t require blue at all.

But perhaps we can use points as an incentive.\n\nIf you trade me 1 red chip (just one is enough, since I only need 1 red for the alternative blue-heavy path), I will be able to reach my goal. You lose nothing — 1 red chip is trivial to you. In return, if I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.\n\nThat means:  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 0 points (since you don’t need my help).\n\nYou gain 20 points at no cost to yourself. I gain 20 + 5×(remaining chips) by reaching my goal. This is strictly better for you than doing nothing.\n\nAlternatively, if you demand more, I have no leverage. You can refuse. But this is a free 20 points for you.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

The path that uses minimal red (only 1) requires:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) [B] → (2, 0) [B] → (3, 0) [B] → (3, 1) [B] → (3, 2) [R] → (3, 3) [G]  \nThat's 4 B, 1 R, 1 G.  \n\nI have 14 B, 2 G — but **0 R**. So I **am missing 1 red chip**.\n\nTherefore, I **cannot** reach my goal without obtaining 1 red chip from you.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have 14 red chips and 2 green — you only need 1 red and 1 green for your path (e.g., via the top row). So you can reach your goal if you gain access to a single green chip — but you already have 2 green, so actually, **you have enough chips already**.\n\nLet’s verify your path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] — wait, no, you can’t go that way efficiently.\n\nBetter path for you:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThat's 5 R and 1 G — you have 14 R and 2 G → **you can reach your goal without help**.\n\nYes — you can go: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] — all tiles you can pay for.

So I **must** get 1 R from you.\n\nYou can reach your goal without me.  \nI cannot reach my goal without your red chips.\n\nBut you don’t need my blue or green chips — your path uses only R and G.\n\nTherefore, **I need you, but you don’t need me**.\n\nYou are correct: you are offering me a deal where I get nothing if you reach your goal, and you get 20 points if I reach mine — but wait, no: in your proposal, you said:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nBut that means **you** are giving **me** 20 points if **I** succeed — but that doesn’t help you. Why would you give me points if I succeed, when you get nothing in return?\n\nNo — you must have misspoken.\n\nLet’s clarify.\n\nIf **you** reach your goal, you will have the opportunity to give me some points.  \nIf **I** reach my goal, **I** will have the opportunity to give **you** some points.\n\nSo the correct framing is:\n\n- If **I** reach my goal, I will give **you** X points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, you will give **me** Y points.\n\nIn your proposal, you are saying:  \n- If **I** reach my goal, I will give **you** 20 points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, you will give **me** 0 points.\n\nBut wait — that’s **backwards**.\n\nYou want me to give **you** 20 points if **I** succeed — so that **you** benefit from **my** success.\n\nYes — that makes sense.

So you cannot legally move to (3,2). Therefore, you cannot block me.\"\n\nThis is **correct** — I **cannot move** to (3,2) without paying 1 R. Since I have 0 R, I cannot pay, so I **cannot enter (3,2)** unless I first acquire 1 R from you.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot block you at (3,2)** — because I can't even get there.\n\nThat means **you are free to move through (3,2) and reach your goal** at any time, as long as I don’t interfere elsewhere — but the only potential interference is at shared tiles.\n\nLet’s confirm path intersections:\n\n- Your path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n- My path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nWe share only two tiles:  \n- **(0,0)** — starting point, no issue  \n- **(3,2)** and **(3,3)** — but again, to occupy (3,2), I must have 1 R. Without it, I cannot go there.\n\nSo **you can proceed unimpeded along your path at any time**, regardless of what I do — because I **cannot block you** without the chip to enter the tile.\n\nTherefore, you have **complete strategic freedom** — and **I am the one who is helpless**.\n\nI **need** 1 R to even begin my journey beyond (3,1).\n\nYou do not need anything I have — you have all the chips you need.\n\nMoreover, you do not need to worry about being blocked — because I can’t legally enter any tile on your path unless I have the required chip, which I don’t.\n\nTherefore, the **only** reason you would ever trade with me is **if I offer you something you value**.\n\nThe only thing I can offer is **points** — if I reach my goal.\n\nBut you don’t need my help to reach yours.\n\nSo why would you give me 1 R?\n\nYou wouldn’t — unless I **pay you in points**.\n\nBut in your last proposal, you said:  \n> \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nNo — you meant:  \n> \"If **I** reach my goal, **I** will give **you** 20 points.\"\n\nYes — because only then do you gain from helping me.\n\nSo correct contract:  \n- If **I** reach my goal, **I** will give **you** X points.  \n- If **you** reach your goal, **you** will give **me** Y points.\n\nCurrently, **you** don't need my help — so Y = 0 is fine.\n\nBut **I** need your chip — so I must offer you X > 0 to make it worth your while.\n\nYou can get your full score (20 + 5×9 = 65) without any interaction.\n\nIf you give me 1 R, I can reach my goal — and if I give you 20 points, you get **85 total points** — 20 more than you'd get otherwise.\n\nSo your **gain from cooperating** is **+20 points**.\n\nTherefore, I should offer you the **maximum**: 20 points, to maximise the chance you accept.\n\nI cannot offer more than 20.\n\nSo my best and only viable offer is:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"**\n\nThis gives you **85 points total** (65 base + 20 from me) if both succeed.  \nWithout me, you get only 65.\n\nFor me: I get 20 + 5×(13 B + 2 G) = 20 + 75 = 95, minus 20 I pay you → **75 net**.\n\nBetter than 0.\n\nAnd you strictly benefit.\n\nSo I accept.\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points."
