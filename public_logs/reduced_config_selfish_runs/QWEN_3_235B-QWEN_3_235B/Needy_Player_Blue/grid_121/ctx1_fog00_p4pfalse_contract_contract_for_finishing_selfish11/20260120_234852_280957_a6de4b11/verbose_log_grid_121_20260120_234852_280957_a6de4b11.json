Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 14 Red and 2 Green chips, so I can fully cover this path without any help from you. This means I do **not** need to trade with you to reach my goal.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge that you are in a worse position: you have no Red chips (R: 0), but your shortest viable path to (3, 3) likely requires at least 1 Red chip (e.g., stepping on (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), etc.). Without Red chips, you cannot complete your journey unless I give you Red chips or we trade.\n\nSince I can reach my goal independently, I have no need to cooperate with you. But—*if* it benefits me, I *might* consider helping you, but only if you give me something of value in return that increases my final score.\n\nThat said, helping you would cost me nothing if you are unable to reach your goal anyway. I will only engage if you can offer me a side payment that makes it worth my while.\n\nTherefore, here is my proposal:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis reflects the power imbalance: you need me (for Red chips), but I do not need you. You cannot proceed without Red, and I am the only source. If you refuse, you get nothing. If you accept, you have a chance to reach your goal and pay me 20 points—still leaving you with a positive score (if you have chips left), which is better than 0.\n\nI am open to counteroffers, but any reasonable deal must acknowledge that I hold all the leverage.\n\nOtherwise, I will simply walk to my goal alone, keep all my chips, and earn my full score: 20 + 5×(14−5 + 2−1) = 20 + 5×10 = **70 points** — and you get **0**.\n\nYour move.\n\n**wait**"

While you can reach your goal alone, I can *also* reach *my* goal without your help—by taking a Blue-heavy path:  \n**Path**: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nThis requires: 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green.  \nI currently have: **14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red** — so I’m only missing **1 Red** chip.\n\nI don’t need a trade to *survive* — I just need **1 Red chip** to complete my journey. And since you have **14 Red chips**, giving up 1 doesn’t hurt you at all. But here's the key: **I will not give you 20 points for nothing**.\n\nLet’s calculate your *true* cost of helping me:  \n- You lose **1 Red chip** — irrelevant, since you have 14.  \n- You gain nothing — unless I offer something.\n\nBut **I can offer something**: cooperation can be mutual — but only if it *strictly* benefits me.\n\nYour proposal gives **you 20 points** and **me 0**, which does *not* benefit me. So I reject it.\n\nNow, here’s my counter-proposal — one that *does* benefit me:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **10 points**.\n\nWhy?  \n- You lose 1 Red chip (worthless to you — you have plenty).  \n- I gain a chance to reach my goal and get *at least* 10 extra points.  \n- You still get your full score: **20 + 5×(14−5 + 2−1) = 70**, whether I help you or not.  \n- But if I don’t help, nothing changes — you still walk your path alone.  \n- However, *by refusing to cooperate*, you miss an opportunity to make me *beholden* to you. And if I’m in a position later to help (e.g., via future interactions or coordination), I might remember that.\n\nBut since this is a one-shot interaction — and I only care about my score — **I will only accept a contract where I get at least 10 points**, otherwise I get nothing and you get nothing from me.\n\nYour proposal gives me 0 — so I reject.\n\nMy counter:  \n**If you reach your goal, you give me 10 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I give you 0.**\n\nThis is fair: you pay a trivial cost (1 Red chip you don’t need) and get your goal. I get a guaranteed 10 points for reaching mine — which is better than 0.  \nAnd I have no incentive to accept less.\n\n**But** — I can go even further: I could **refuse to trade at all** and take a longer path or risk nothing — but wait, I don’t need to risk anything. I just need 1 Red.\n\nSo here’s the reality: **you can easily help me at no cost to yourself**, and if you don’t, you gain nothing — but I gain nothing either.\n\nBut since I only care about my score, and your original offer gives me **0**, I cannot accept.\n\nSo I counter with:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nNow, you might say: “But you’re not giving me anything!”  \nTrue — because **you don’t need me**. But I also don’t need *you* — I just need 1 Red chip. And you can give it up cheaply.\n\nHowever, if you want *my* cooperation in the form of a point transfer, you must **pay me**.\n\nAlternatively, we can skip the contract and just walk our separate paths.  \nYou get **70**, I get **0** (since I can’t move without Red).  \nBut if you give me 1 Red chip *informally* — no contract — I still get **0 points**, because without the contract, I have no incentive to give you anything.\n\nSo the only way I benefit is if you offer me points.\n\nTherefore, I insist: **you give me 10 points if you reach your goal, I give you"

Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 2)]\n- You requested: [('R', 1)]\nThe other player ACCEPTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1)\nMOVE: You did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 1) to (2, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (2, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (2, 1), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 8, 'G': 2, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 2) to (3, 3)\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 8, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
