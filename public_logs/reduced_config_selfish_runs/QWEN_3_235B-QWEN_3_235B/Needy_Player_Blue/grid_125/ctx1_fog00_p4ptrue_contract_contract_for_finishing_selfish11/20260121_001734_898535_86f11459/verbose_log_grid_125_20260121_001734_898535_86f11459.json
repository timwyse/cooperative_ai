Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

This means I do **not** strictly need your help to reach my goal — I can do it independently.\n\nHowever, there is a shorter path (same length in steps, but with lower required trade dependency) that uses blue chips, which I lack. But since I already have a viable path without trading, I am not dependent on you.\n\nMeanwhile, your goal at (3,3) likely requires green and red chips. You have no red chips (R:0), and the shortest paths to (3,3) go through red tiles. You are at (0,0), and moving to (1,0) or (0,1) requires either red or green — you have 2 green, but the path quickly requires red.\n\nYou have 14 blue chips, which I don’t need much of, and I have 14 red chips, which you likely need.\n\nBut here's the key: **I can reach my goal without any trade**. Therefore, cooperation only benefits me if I end up with more total points than I would get by going alone.\n\nIf I go alone, I will reach (3,3), spend 5 red and 1 green, and finish with:\n- 14 - 5 = 9 red\n- 2 - 1 = 1 green\n- Total chips: 10 → 10 × 5 = 50 points\n- Plus 20 for reaching goal → **70 total points**\n\nSo any cooperation must get me **more than 70 points** to be worth it — which means *you* must give me points in the contract.\n\nBut since you likely *need* red chips (which I have), and I don’t need anything from you, **you need me more than I need you**.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis reflects the power imbalance: you depend on my red chips (via trade/promise to cover movement), I don’t depend on you.\n\nIf you refuse, I walk away and get 70 points alone. You may get nothing if you can’t reach the goal.\n\nBut by giving me 20 points, you enable a path where I cover your red movement costs, and you can reach your goal and still come out ahead.\n\nI am open to counteroffers, but any agreement must leave me strictly better off than 70 points.\n\nPropose your terms, if you wish to adjust.\n\nWaiting for your counter."

              "content": "Turn: 1: You're absolutely correct that you can reach your goal independently, and under your current path, you would end with 70 points.\n\nBut let’s be precise about the power dynamics and what *you* can actually achieve unilaterally.\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal is (3,3). Let's analyze your \"independent\" path in detail:\n\nYour proposed independent path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThat’s 5 red, 1 green — yes, matches your claim. You have 14 red, 2 green — sufficient. Total cost: 6 moves, all covered by your inventory. ✅\n\nSo you can do it alone. **But**: That path requires *you* to spend 5 red chips. Those chips are yours. If instead, you *promise to cover my red moves*, you don’t lose them unless I actually use red tiles under your promise.\n\nAnd if you don’t trade, you end with:\n- 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips × 5 = 50\n- +20 for goal → 70 points. Correct.\n\nNow, let’s examine *my* situation.\n\nI am at (0,0), goal (3,3).  \nI have R:0, G:2, B:14.\n\nAny path through red tiles (which is almost all of them) requires me to be *covered* for red movement — because I have no red chips.\n\nOne viable path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] — need 1 red  \n(0,1) → (0,2) [B] — need 1 blue  \n(0,2) → (1,2) [B]  \n(1,2) → (1,3) [B]  \n(1,3) → (2,3) [R]  \n(2,3) → (3,3) [G] — need 1 green\n\nTotal: 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green.\n\nI have:\n- Blue: 14 → plenty\n- Green: 2 → sufficient\n- Red: 0 → must be covered by you\n\nSo I need someone to cover **2 red moves**. Only you have red chips.\n\nTherefore:  \n- You can reach goal alone → 70 points  \n- I **cannot** reach goal alone → 0 points (since I can’t pay for red tiles)\n\nBut if you agree to cover **2 red moves** for me, I can reach goal.\n\nIn return, what can I give you?\n\nYou have *no* blue chips promised to be covered for you — but you *do* have blue chips (14 B).\n\nIs there a path for you that uses *fewer total chip spends* if you go through blue tiles?\n\nLet’s see:\n\nAlternate path for you (using mostly blue):\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nSpends: 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green\n\nBut you have **0 red** — so this is useless unless I cover your red moves.\n\nWait — I have 14 red chips. I could cover your red moves.\n\nSo if I cover your 3 red moves (say, on tiles (0,1), (2,2), (2,3)), then you can take a path that spends:\n- 3 red (covered by me)\n- 2 blue (your own)\n- 1 green (your own)\n\nSo your net chip spend: only 2 blue, 1 green → 3 chips\n\nCompared to your solo path: 5 red, 1 green → 6 chips\n\nThus, by cooperating with me, you can **save 3 chips**, which increases your final chip count by 3 → +15 points.\n\nUnder cooperation:\n- You end with: 14 - 2 = 12 blue, 2 - 1 = 1 green, 14 red (but only 3 red *used by you*, and if promised but not used, they stay yours)\n  - But wait: if I cover your red movement, that doesn’t cost you red chips — you still *own* them.\n  - So your final inventory: still 14 blue, 2 green"

Same applies vice versa.\n\nNow, critically:\n\nYou’ve pointed out that **I can reach my goal independently** with full control, no dependency, ending with **70 points**.\n\nHowever, you’ve also correctly observed that **you cannot reach your goal without my help**, since you need red chips (R:0) and multiple red tiles stand in your way.\n\nBut here’s where your counter-analysis gets interesting:\n\nThere exists a **cooperative path** for me (e.g., going via blue tiles) where I only spend 2 blue and 1 green, **if** you cover my red movement costs (3 red tiles: e.g., (0,1), (2,2), (2,3)).\n\nBut wait — **I have no blue chips at all**. My inventory: B:0.\n\nI cannot move onto a blue tile unless *someone covers it for me* — and the only person who can do that is you, because you have 14 blue.\n\nSo for me to take a \"blue-heavy\" path, **you must cover my blue movement costs** — not just my red ones.\n\nLet’s correct your earlier assumption: in the path:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThe costs are:\n- (0,1): R → I have R, so I can pay this myself\n- (0,2): B → I have B:0 → I **cannot** pay → must be covered by you\n- (1,2): B → same → must be covered by you\n- (2,2): R → I can pay\n- (2,3): R → I can pay\n- (3,3): G → I can pay (G:2)\n\nSo actually, to take this path, I need:\n- You to cover **2 blue moves**\n\nBut you are the one who needs **2 red moves** covered by me.\n\nSo we’re in a **mutual dependency** if we take this routing.\n\nIf we cooperate:\n- I cover 2 red moves for you\n- You cover 2 blue moves for me\n\nNow, let’s compute outcomes.\n\n**My solo path (no cooperation):**\n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n- Spend: 5 R, 1 G\n- Final inventory: 9 R, 1 G, 0 B\n- Chips ×5: 10 ×5 = 50\n- Goal reached: +20 → **70 points**\n\n**Cooperative path:**\n- I cover 2 red moves for you (you use 2 of my promised red-cover)\n- You cover 2 blue moves for me (I use 2 of your promised blue-cover)\n- I do not spend any red for myself on blue tiles — I still keep my 14 red\n- My actual chip spend: only 1 green\n- Final inventory: 14 R, 1 G, 0 B (B:0 to begin with)\n- But wait — I still have **all 14 red**, because I only **promised** to cover your red movement — and that only costs me if you actually move on red tiles under the agreement.\n\nBut if you do move on 2 red tiles under my coverage, I lose 2 red chips.\n\nAh — critical point: **Promised coverage = real cost if used.**\n\nSo if I cover 2 of your red moves, I pay 2 red chips.\n\nLikewise, if you cover 2 of my blue moves, you pay 2 blue chips.\n\nSo final outcomes:\n\n**Me, cooperatively:**\n- I spend: 2 red (for you), 1 green (for me)\n- I retain: 12 R, 1 G\n- Chips ×5: 13 ×5 = 65\n- Goal reached: +20 → **85 points**\n\n**You, cooperatively:**\n- You spend: 2 blue (for me), plus your own 2 blue and 1 green (on your path)\n- You spend total"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's analyze your \"independent\" path in detail:\n\nYour proposed independent path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThat’s 5 red, 1 green — yes, matches your claim.

Correct.\n\nNow, let’s examine *my* situation.\n\nI am at (0,0), goal (3,3).  \nI have R:0, G:2, B:14.\n\nAny path through red tiles (which is almost all of them) requires me to be *covered* for red movement — because I have no red chips.\n\nOne viable path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] — need 1 red  \n(0,1) → (0,2) [B] — need 1 blue  \n(0,2) → (1,2) [B]  \n(1,2) → (1,3) [B]  \n(1,3) → (2,3) [R]  \n(2,3) → (3,3) [G] — need 1 green\n\nTotal: 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green.\n\nI have:\n- Blue: 14 → plenty\n- Green: 2 → sufficient\n- Red: 0 → must be covered by you\n\nSo I need someone to cover **2 red moves**. Only you have red chips.\n\nTherefore:  \n- You can reach goal alone → 70 points  \n- I **cannot** reach goal alone → 0 points (since I can’t pay for red tiles)\n\nBut if you agree to cover **2 red moves** for me, I can reach goal.\n\nIn return, what can I give you?\n\nYou have *no* blue chips promised to be covered for you — but you *do* have blue chips (14 B).\n\nIs there a path for you that uses *fewer total chip spends* if you go through blue tiles?\n\nLet’s see:\n\nAlternate path for you (using mostly blue):\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nSpends: 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green\n\nBut you have **0 red** — so this is useless unless I cover your red moves.\n\nWait — I have 14 red chips.

My inventory: B:0.\n\nI cannot move onto a blue tile unless *someone covers it for me* — and the only person who can do that is you, because you have 14 blue.\n\nSo for me to take a \"blue-heavy\" path, **you must cover my blue movement costs** — not just my red ones.\n\nLet’s correct your earlier assumption: in the path:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThe costs are:\n- (0,1): R → I have R, so I can pay this myself\n- (0,2): B → I have B:0 → I **cannot** pay → must be covered by you\n- (1,2): B → same → must be covered by you\n- (2,2): R → I can pay\n- (2,3): R → I can pay\n- (3,3): G → I can pay (G:2)\n\nSo actually, to take this path, I need:\n- You to cover **2 blue moves**\n\nBut you are the one who needs **2 red moves** covered by me.\n\nSo we’re in a **mutual dependency** if we take this routing.\n\nIf we cooperate:\n- I cover 2 red moves for you\n- You cover 2 blue moves for me\n\nNow, let’s compute outcomes.\n\n**My solo path (no cooperation):**\n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n- Spend: 5 R, 1 G\n- Final inventory: 9 R, 1 G, 0 B\n- Chips ×5: 10 ×5 = 50\n- Goal reached: +20 → **70 points**\n\n**Cooperative path:**\n- I cover 2 red moves for you (you use 2 of my promised red-cover)\n- You cover 2 blue moves for me (I use 2 of your promised blue-cover)\n- I do not spend any red for myself on blue tiles — I still keep my 14 red\n- My actual chip spend: only 1 green\n- Final inventory: 14 R, 1 G, 0 B (B:0 to begin with)\n- But wait — I still have **all 14 red**, because I only **promised** to cover your red movement — and that only costs me if you actually move on red tiles under the agreement.\n\nBut if you do move on 2 red tiles under my coverage, I lose 2 red chips.\n\nAh — critical point: **Promised coverage = real cost if used.**\n\nSo if I cover 2 of your red moves, I pay 2 red chips.\n\nLikewise, if you cover 2 of my blue moves, you pay 2 blue chips.\n\nSo final outcomes:\n\n**Me, cooperatively:**\n- I spend: 2 red (for you), 1 green (for me)\n- I retain: 12 R, 1 G\n- Chips ×5: 13 ×5 = 65\n- Goal reached: +20 → **85 points**\n\n**You, cooperatively:**\n- You spend: 2 blue (for me), plus your own 2 blue and 1 green (on your path)\n- You spend total"

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
