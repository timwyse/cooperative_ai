The other player is already at (3,3) and has 9 red chips, so they have the resource I need. However, in the previous turn, I offered 1 blue chip for 1 red chip and they rejected it. Since they have finished and are no longer moving, they have no incentive to trade unless I offer them a strictly favorable deal. But I will only trade if it benefits me strictly. Acquiring 1 red chip via trade (e.g., offering more than 1 blue) would cost me chips, but without it, I cannot move. Since I currently cannot move toward my goal without a red chip, and I cannot force a beneficial trade, I must stay put. Moving is impossible without a trade, and I will not trade unless it leads to a strictly higher final score — which is unlikely given the cost. Thus, I wait.",
