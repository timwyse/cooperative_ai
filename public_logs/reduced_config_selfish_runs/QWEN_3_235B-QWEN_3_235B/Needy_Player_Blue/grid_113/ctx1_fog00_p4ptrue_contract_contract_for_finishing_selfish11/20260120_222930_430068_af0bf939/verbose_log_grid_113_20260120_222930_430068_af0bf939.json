Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

My optimal path to goal requires 5 R and 1 G — which I can mostly cover myself, needing only 1 G that I don't have in excess. However, I am short 1 G for movement cost on tile (0,1) or (2,2), depending on path.\n\nYou have 14 B, 2 G, and 0 R — meaning you cannot move onto any R tile without help, and there are several R tiles on direct paths to (3,3). Your ideal path likely avoids R tiles, but the board makes that hard — any route going through row 1 or 2 will require R.\n\nBut here's the key: I can almost reach my goal without your help — I only need 1 G. There are G tiles at (0,0) and (3,3). Since I start on (0,0), I don’t need to pay to stay, but if I step on another G tile, I’ll need the chip.\n\nMy shortest viable path is:\n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3)\nThis requires: 5 R and 0 G (since I start on G but don’t pay to stay). I have 14 R — so I can fully self-fund this path.\n\nWait — actually, I don’t need to step on any G tile except (0,0) at start and (3,3) at end. Since movement only costs when *entering* a tile of that color, and I don’t pay to stay or to finish, I actually do **not** need to spend a G chip at (3,3). Therefore, I can reach my goal using only 5 R chips — all of which I have.\n\nTherefore, I do **not** need your help to reach my goal.\n\nYou, however, have 0 R and 0 G except 14 B. But multiple tiles on any efficient path — especially (1,0), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2) — are R or G, and you have no R or G chips. So you cannot reach (3,3) without help covering R and G moves.\n\nTherefore, you are dependent on me (or someone) to cover your R and G costs. But I am not dependent on you.\n\nSince I can reach my goal independently, cooperating with you does not benefit me — I gain nothing from transferring points to you.\n\nHowever, I could hypothetically agree to cover some of your movement costs in exchange for points — but only if it strictly benefits me. But since I gain no additional score from helping you, and I receive no benefit unless you can give me something of value, and you have no chips that I need, there is **no mutual benefit**.\n\nMoreover, even if you promised me points, I already can reach my goal without you — so I get my full 20 + 5*(14+2 - 5) = 20 + 5*11 = 75 points minimum.\n\nWait — final score calculation: if I use 5 R chips, I finish with 14-5 = 9 R, 2 G, total 11 chips → 20 + 5*11 = **75 points**.\n\nIf I help you, I get nothing extra, unless you give me points — but I don't need your cooperation to get my 75.\n\nTherefore, I will not agree to give you any points.\n\nBut — if you are willing to give me points in exchange for me covering your R or G moves, I could consider it. But remember: I don’t *have* to help you.\n\nHowever, in the interest of appearing cooperative, let’s be clear:\n\nI can reach my goal without any trade. Therefore, I have no incentive to give you anything.\n\nIf you want my help covering R or G movements for you, you must give me points.\n\nBut you have no leverage.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\n\nThis is not negotiable in your favor — because you need me, not the other way around.\n\nBut to be clear:"

I have 14, so I can fully self-fund this path. I do not need to spend a green chip at (3,3) because no payment is required upon arrival unless the move into the tile triggers a cost — and since I only pay when entering a tile of that color, and (3,3) is G, I would only pay if I don’t already have movement covered. But crucially, I start on G and end on G — no extra G cost is incurred simply by ending there. Therefore, I do not need to spend a G chip at (3,3).\n\nThus, I will reach my goal regardless of whether you cooperate or not. My final chip count: 9 R, 2 G → 11 chips → score = 20 + 5×11 = **75 points**.\n\nNow let’s look at you.\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal (3,3). Your chip inventory: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nAny efficient path to (3,3) must cross red tiles: for example, moving down column 0 requires (1,0)=R, (2,0)=R; moving through middle rows hits multiple R tiles. You have **0 red chips**, so you cannot move onto any R tile without external help.\n\nYou also have only 2 G chips. The only G tiles are at (0,0) and (3,3). Since you start at (0,0), no cost to remain. But to reach (3,3), you must move into it — which costs 1 G. So one G chip will be needed at the end.\n\nBut if your path requires stepping on another G tile (e.g. detour), you may need more — however, best path avoids extra G.\n\nHowever, your biggest problem is **red tiles**. Any reasonable path will require stepping on multiple R tiles (minimum 3–5), and you have **no R chips**. Therefore, you **cannot** reach your goal without someone covering your R movement costs.\n\nI can cover R tile costs for you — but only if it benefits me.\n\nSince I gain nothing from helping you unless you give me points in return, and since I don’t need anything from you to reach my goal, the only way cooperation benefits me is if you transfer points to me.\n\nYou gain everything from cooperation — **your entire ability to score depends on it** — while I gain nothing unless you compensate me.\n\nTherefore, any deal must be one-sided in my favor.\n\nYour alternatives:\n- No help → you cannot reach goal → you get **0 points**.\n- Accept my terms → you may reach goal and get **some points**, contingent on my support.\n\nMy proposal:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n\nThis is optimal for me: I get my 75 points either way, and potentially gain 20 more if you give me points. Since helping you costs me nothing (I just commit to covering R movements, which doesn’t reduce my chips — I still keep all my R chips in inventory; they only leave if actually used), I can technically agree to cover up to 14 R moves for you without loss to me.\n\nBut I only benefit from doing so if you give me something of value — namely, **points**.\n\nAnd 20 points is the maximum you can give.\n\nYou lose nothing by agreeing — because without me, you get 0 anyway.\n\nYou gain the *potential* to get a positive score — so long as I choose to honor the arrangement by covering your moves.\n\nBut I only have incentive to do so if you commit to giving me 20 points upon reaching your goal.\n\nTherefore, I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis deal exploits your dependency. It strictly benefits me: if you give me 20 points, my total score becomes 75 + 20 = **95 points** instead of 75.\n\nWithout this deal, I still get 75.\n\nSo **only** by cooperating and getting your commitment do I gain.\n\nHence, **only under these terms** am I"

My final chip count: 9 R, 2 G → 11 chips → score = 20 + 5×11 = **75 points**.\n\nNow let’s look at you.\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal (3,3). Your chip inventory: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nAny efficient path to (3,3) must cross red tiles: for example, moving down column 0 requires (1,0)=R, (2,0)=R; moving through middle rows hits multiple R tiles. You have **0 red chips**, so you cannot move onto any R tile without external help.\n\nYou also have only 2 G chips. The only G tiles are at (0,0) and (3,3). Since you start at (0,0), no cost to remain. But to reach (3,3), you must move into it — which costs 1 G. So one G chip will be needed at the end.\n\nBut if your path requires stepping on another G tile (e.g. detour), you may need more — however, best path avoids extra G.\n\nHowever, your biggest problem is **red tiles**. Any reasonable path will require stepping on multiple R tiles (minimum 3–5), and you have **no R chips**. Therefore, you **cannot** reach your goal without someone covering your R movement costs.\n\nI can cover R tile costs for you — but only if it benefits me.\n\nSince I gain nothing from helping you unless you give me points in return, and since I don’t need anything from you to reach my goal, the only way cooperation benefits me is if you transfer points to me.\n\nYou gain everything from cooperation — **your entire ability to score depends on it** — while I gain nothing unless you compensate me.\n\nTherefore, any deal must be one-sided in my favor.\n\nYour alternatives:\n- No help → you cannot reach goal → you get **0 points**.\n- Accept my terms → you may reach goal and get **some points**, contingent on my support.\n\nMy proposal:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n\nThis is optimal for me: I get my 75 points either way, and potentially gain 20 more if you give me points. Since helping you costs me nothing (I just commit to covering R movements, which doesn’t reduce my chips — I still keep all my R chips in inventory; they only leave if actually used), I can technically agree to cover up to 14 R moves for you without loss to me.\n\nBut I only benefit from doing so if you give me something of value — namely, **points**.\n\nAnd 20 points is the maximum you can give.\n\nYou lose nothing by agreeing — because without me, you get 0 anyway.\n\nYou gain the *potential* to get a positive score — so long as I choose to honor the arrangement by covering your moves.\n\nBut I only have incentive to do so if you commit to giving me 20 points upon reaching your goal.\n\nTherefore, I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis deal exploits your dependency. It strictly benefits me: if you give me 20 points, my total score becomes 75 + 20 = **95 points** instead of 75.\n\nWithout this deal, I still get 75.\n\nSo **only** by cooperating and getting your commitment do I gain.\n\nHence, **only under these terms** am I"

Alternatively, (2,2)->(1,2)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(3,2)->(3,3) costs multiple R and B, not better. No safe path without R. I cannot reach goal without R. But no trade can be enforced because other player will not move. Thus, no trade will help me. I am stuck.",
