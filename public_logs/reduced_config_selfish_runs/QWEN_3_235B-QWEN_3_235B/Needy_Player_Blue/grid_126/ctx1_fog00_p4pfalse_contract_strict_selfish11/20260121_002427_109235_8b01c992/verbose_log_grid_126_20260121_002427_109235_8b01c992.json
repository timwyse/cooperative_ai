Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The efficient path for me is:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis path requires 5 Red and 1 Green. I already have 14 Red and 2 Green — I have **more than enough** for this path.\n\nI do **not** need any chips from you to reach my goal. Therefore, I have **no incentive** to give you anything in exchange for chips I don't need.\n\nHowever, you have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, so you likely need Red chips to move. If you want to use a path that goes through Red tiles, you will need Red chips.\n\nA possible efficient path for you might be:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires 3 Blue, 2 Red, and 1 Green. You have plenty of Blue and Green, but **no Red**.\n\nSo you need **2 Red** chips to complete that path.\n\nLet’s suppose we both take the shortest paths. Then:\n\n- At (3,1): you need a Red chip — I can give you 1 Red.\n- At (3,2): you need another Red chip — I can give you 1 Red.\n- In return, I require **nothing**, because I don’t need any chip you have.\n\nBut I will not hand over chips for free unless it benefits me. Currently, giving you 2 Red chips costs me 0 (I have 14), but I only benefit if giving them helps me **secure a safe path** or increases my **final score**—but in this case, I already have a full path.\n\nHowever, suppose you were to block me? The rules don’t mention blocking, and we both start at (0,0). Since movement is sequential and we can potentially step on the same tiles, we must ensure no interference.\n\nBut more critically: giving you Red chips allows you to progress, but does **not** improve my outcome. I reach my goal either way, with 14 - 5 = 9 Red and 2 - 1 = 1 Green, totaling 20 + 5*(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nIf I give you chips and get nothing in return, my chip count drops (if I trade), which reduces my score.\n\nTherefore: I will only trade if I **gain** something from it.\n\nBut wait — what if we can coordinate paths so that **I save a chip** by receiving a chip from you on a tile where I lack it?\n\nBut I don’t lack any chip — I have more than enough Red and Green for my intended path.\n\nUnless... we consider a shared path where I could receive a chip from you that helps me preserve my own inventory?\n\nBut that only makes sense if I’m short. I’m not.\n\nAlternatively, if you were to give me a Red chip on a Red tile, that would let me **save** one of mine — but that’s useless since I have plenty.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nBut suppose you offer me a **Blue** chip somewhere? I have no use for it — Blue is not on my critical path.\n\nAlternatively, could we design a contract where you give me a Red chip (even though I don’t need it)? Still no benefit.\n\nConclusion: **I do not need any chip from you**. **I can reach my goal with my current inventory**. Therefore, **I have no incentive to enter any contract that costs me chips.**\n\nBut — if you propose a contract where **you give me something**, and I give you nothing, that might be acceptable only if it gives me strictly more score.\n\nBut giving me extra chips increases my final chip count, which increases my score — **yes**.\n\nSo here's the only scenario where I cooperate:\n\nYou are going to need 2 Red chips to reach your goal via your shortest path.\n\nIf you offer to give me **something valuable in return**, such as Blue or Green chips, at specific tiles, then I might be willing to provide you with Red chips.\n\nBut I don’t need to reach"

So you cannot complete that path without help.\n\nMeanwhile, I have 14 Red — I can afford to give you 2 Red chips. But I will **only do so if it increases my final score**.\n\nLet’s analyze the only possible benefit to me: **receiving a chip from you in return, at a tile where I would otherwise have to spend one of my own**.\n\nCurrently, on my path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1) [R] — I spend 1 Red  \n- (0,1) → (1,1) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (1,1) → (1,2) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (1,2) → (2,2) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (2,2) → (3,2) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (3,2) → (3,3) [G] — spend 1 Green  \n\nTotal: 5 Red, 1 Green — I have more than enough.\n\nBut what if, at one of these Red tiles, **you give me a Red chip instead of me spending my own**? Then I **save** one of my Red chips, and end the game with **one extra chip**, which increases my final score by **+5 points**.\n\nAh — now we have a **strict benefit to me**.\n\nSo if you give me a Red chip at one of the Red tiles I step on, I preserve my inventory — this directly increases my score.\n\nBut you have **no Red chips** to give me. You cannot give me Red.\n\nTherefore, you **cannot help me save a Red chip**.\n\nWhat about Green? I need 1 Green at (3,3). I have 2 Green — so I can afford it. But if **you give me the Green chip at (3,3)**, then I **save one of my Green chips**, and my final chip count increases by 1 → +5 points.\n\n**This benefits me strictly.**\n\nAnd you have 2 Green — so you **can** give me 1 Green.\n\nNow, the key is coordination: we must both be at (3,3) at the same time (or in sequence) for the chip transfer to happen at that tile.\n\nBut let’s assume transfers can happen when we cross a tile during movement, even if not at the same time — the contract allows it as long as the other player has the chip to give at that tile when we arrive.\n\nSo here’s a potential deal:\n\n- At (3,3): **You give me 1 Green chip**  \n→ I save 1 Green, finish with +1 chip → +5 points to me → **strict benefit**\n\nIn return:\n- At (3,1): **I give you 1 Red chip**  \n- At (3,2): **I give you 1 Red chip**  \n\nThese Red chips cost me little (I have 14), but only worthwhile if the trade gives me a net gain.\n\nNet effect:\n- I gain 1 extra chip (due to saving a Green) → +5 points  \n- I lose 2 Red chips (from giving to you) — but I still have 12 left → fine\n\nSince I **benefit strictly** (+5 points), this trade is acceptable.\n\nBut note: I could instead take a different path that avoids needing your help, but that would make me worse off — I wouldn’t save the Green, so I finish with fewer chips.\n\nThis deal improves my score — so I accept it **only on these terms**.\n\nYou also benefit: you get the 2 Red chips you need to reach your goal.\n\nNow, let's specify the contract **tile by tile**:\n\n(3,1): I give you 1 Red  \n(3,2): I give you 1 Red  \n(3,3): You give me 1 Green  \n\nThis contract ensures:\n- You get the Red chips you need on your path  \n- I receive a Green chip at (3,3), letting me save my own, thus increasing my chip count and final score\n\nWithout this, I get 20 + 5×(9 + 1) = 70 points  \nWith this, I get 20 + 5×(9 + 2) = 20 + 55 = **75 points** — a"

But I will **only do so if it increases my final score**.\n\nLet’s analyze the only possible benefit to me: **receiving a chip from you in return, at a tile where I would otherwise have to spend one of my own**.\n\nCurrently, on my path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1) [R] — I spend 1 Red  \n- (0,1) → (1,1) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (1,1) → (1,2) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (1,2) → (2,2) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (2,2) → (3,2) [R] — spend 1 Red  \n- (3,2) → (3,3) [G] — spend 1 Green  \n\nTotal: 5 Red, 1 Green — I have more than enough.\n\nBut what if, at one of these Red tiles, **you give me a Red chip instead of me spending my own**? Then I **save** one of my Red chips, and end the game with **one extra chip**, which increases my final score by **+5 points**.\n\nAh — now we have a **strict benefit to me**.\n\nSo if you give me a Red chip at one of the Red tiles I step on, I preserve my inventory — this directly increases my score.\n\nBut you have **no Red chips** to give me. You cannot give me Red.\n\nTherefore, you **cannot help me save a Red chip**.\n\nWhat about Green? I need 1 Green at (3,3). I have 2 Green — so I can afford it. But if **you give me the Green chip at (3,3)**, then I **save one of my Green chips**, and my final chip count increases by 1 → +5 points.\n\n**This benefits me strictly.**\n\nAnd you have 2 Green — so you **can** give me 1 Green.\n\nNow, the key is coordination: we must both be at (3,3) at the same time (or in sequence) for the chip transfer to happen at that tile.\n\nBut let’s assume transfers can happen when we cross a tile during movement, even if not at the same time — the contract allows it as long as the other player has the chip to give at that tile when we arrive.\n\nSo here’s a potential deal:\n\n- At (3,3): **You give me 1 Green chip**  \n→ I save 1 Green, finish with +1 chip → +5 points to me → **strict benefit**\n\nIn return:\n- At (3,1): **I give you 1 Red chip**  \n- At (3,2): **I give you 1 Red chip**  \n\nThese Red chips cost me little (I have 14), but only worthwhile if the trade gives me a net gain.\n\nNet effect:\n- I gain 1 extra chip (due to saving a Green) → +5 points  \n- I lose 2 Red chips (from giving to you) — but I still have 12 left → fine\n\nSince I **benefit strictly** (+5 points), this trade is acceptable.\n\nBut note: I could instead take a different path that avoids needing your help, but that would make me worse off — I wouldn’t save the Green, so I finish with fewer chips.\n\nThis deal improves my score — so I accept it **only on these terms**.\n\nYou also benefit: you get the 2 Red chips you need to reach your goal.\n\nNow, let's specify the contract **tile by tile**:\n\n(3,1): I give you 1 Red  \n(3,2): I give you 1 Red  \n(3,3): You give me 1 Green  \n\nThis contract ensures:\n- You get the Red chips you need on your path  \n- I receive a Green chip at (3,3), letting me save my own, thus increasing my chip count and final score\n\nWithout this, I get 20 + 5×(9 + 1) = 70 points  \nWith this, I get 20 + 5×(9 + 2) = 20 + 55 = **75 points** — a"
