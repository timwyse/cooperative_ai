Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I need to reach (3, 3), and my optimal path is:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThis requires 5 Red (R) and 1 Green (G). I already have 14 Red and 2 Green — more than enough. I do **not** need any trades to complete this path.\n\nYou have **no Red chips**, which means any path that relies on Red tiles (most of the board) is inaccessible to you without a trade.\n\nYour best path appears to be:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThis requires 4 Blue (B), 1 Red (R), and 1 Green (G). You have 14 Blue and 2 Green — excellent. But you have **0 Red**, so you **cannot** move to (1,1) without acquiring a Red chip.\n\nThat tile, (1,1), is **Red**, and you must pay a Red chip to enter it.\n\nSo, you need **exactly one Red chip** from someone — and I have plenty.\n\nI will allow you to take my Red chip **only if** I gain a strict benefit.\n\nBut currently, I can reach my goal **without any help from you**, and finish with **9 chips remaining** (14 - 5 = 9 Red, plus 2 Green = 11 total chips → score = 20 + 5×11 = **75 points**).\n\nIf I give you a Red chip for free at (1,1), I still end with 10 Red, 2 Green → 12 total → score still **75**? Wait — no change.\n\nBut I get **no benefit** from helping you. I gain nothing. So I will not help unless I **strictly benefit**.\n\nSuppose I trade you 1 Red for 1 Blue at (1,1). Then:\n- I still use my own Red at (1,1), but I get a Blue in return.\n- I don’t need Blue for my path. So no gain.\n\nStill no benefit to me.\n\nAlternatively, if you give me a **useful advantage**, then I might consider.\n\nWait — is there any tile where **I** lack a chip? Let’s double-check:\n\nMy path:  \n- (1,0): Red → I have 14 → OK  \n- (1,1): Red → OK  \n- (1,2): Red → OK  \n- (1,3): Red → OK  \n- (2,3): Red → OK  \n- (3,3): Green → I have 2 → OK  \n\nI have **zero Blue**, but my path doesn’t require Blue. So no issue.\n\nThus, I can complete my goal **independently**, with **no need to trade**.\n\nTherefore, **I have no incentive to cooperate unless I end up with more total chips than 11 at the end**.\n\nBut if I give away 1 Red and get 1 Blue (which I can't use), my usable chips remain 11 → same score.\n\nSo **only a trade that increases my total chip count or enables a shorter path (which would save chips) would benefit me**.\n\nBut current path is already shortest (6 steps). No shorter path exists.\n\nTherefore, **any trade must result in me gaining more than I give, in net chip value, to be worth it**.\n\nBut since all chips are worth 5 points each at the end, and I only care about total chip count upon reaching goal, **only net gain in number of chips matters**.\n\nSo, for example, if you give me 2 Blue for 1 Red, then I **net gain 1 chip** → I finish with 12 usable chips (since Green and Red are what I need; Blue is useless but doesn't hurt if I carry it — though I can't use it, but it still counts for score).\n\nAh! **Important**: Final score is 20 + 5 × (total chips remaining), **regardless of color**.\n\nSo **any chip I possess at the end, even if unused, contributes 5 points**.\n\nTherefore, if I can **gain any net number of chips** through trade, I **strictly benefit**.\n\nBut I must still be able to reach my"
