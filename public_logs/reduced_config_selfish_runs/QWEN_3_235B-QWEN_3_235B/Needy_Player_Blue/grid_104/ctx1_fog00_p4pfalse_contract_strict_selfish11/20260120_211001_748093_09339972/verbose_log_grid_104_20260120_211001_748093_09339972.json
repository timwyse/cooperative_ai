Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I am self-sufficient.\n\nAny trade would only hurt me (lose chips) or be neutral.\n\nTherefore, I have **no incentive to cooperate**.\n\nI can reach goal on my own, with high chip count.\n\nThey need Red, but I don’t need anything they have (B, G) for my optimal path.\n\nI could consider a longer path that uses Blue or Green to save my Red chips — but Green is only 2, and Red is abundant for me.\n\nSuppose I take their path: (0,0)→(0,1)[B]→(0,2)[B]→(0,3)[B]→(1,3)[B]→(2,3)[R]→(3,3)[G]\n\nThis requires: B:4, R:1, G:1\n\nBut I have B:0 → I would need them to give me 4 B.\n\nIf they give me 4 B, I can use that path.\n\nI spend: 1 R, 1 G → finish with: 13 R, 1 G, and saved... nothing?

I have 14 Red — so I have excess Red.\n\nBut the other player needs at least 1 Red to reach their goal. They cannot reach (3,3) without stepping on a Red tile (e.g., (2,3) or (3,2)), and they have 0 Red chips.\n\nSo they **must** obtain at least 1 Red chip from me to complete their goal.\n\nI can reach my goal without any interaction. Therefore, the **only** reason I would trade is if I gain something of value in return — specifically, if I can acquire a chip I need for a **better path**, or reduce my chip expenditure.\n\nBut do I need Blue or Green?

No: I don't keep the Blue chips after use — I just use them to move.\n\nI don't gain chips — I consume them.\n\nFinal inventory: I start with 14 R, 2 G → spend 1 R and 1 G → so I have **13 R and 1 G left** → total 14 chips → score = 20 + 5×14 = **90 points**.\n\nBut only if I get 4 B from the other player.\n\nThis is **strictly better** than my current 70-point outcome.\n\nTherefore, if I can get 4 Blue chips to use on this path, I gain 20 extra points.\n\nNow, what does the other player get?\n\nThey need 1 Red chip to reach their goal.\n\nTheir path likely uses 4 Blue and 1 Red and 1 Green.\n\nThey have 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red → so they just need 1 Red.\n\nIf I give them 1 Red, they can complete their goal and score 20 + 5×(14-4 + 2-1 - ?) — they spend 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green → final chips: 10 B, 1 G → 11 chips → 20 + 55 = 75 points.\n\nBut I only benefit if I get 4 Blue *in exchange for* something.\n\nI could give them 1 Red in exchange for 4 Blue.\n\nBut I don't need to give them 1 Red — I could charge **more**.\n\nThey need at least 1 Red.\n\nBut I have 14 — I can afford to give up 1, but only if I get 4 Blue.\n\nIs there a reason to ask for more?\n\nSuppose I propose: they give me 4 Blue, and I give them 1 Red.\n\nI use the Blue chips on tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) → all Blue tiles.\n\nI need to receive 1 Blue chip **before** I step on each of these.\n\nSimilarly, they need 1 Red chip before stepping on a Red tile like (2,3) or (3,2).\n\nSo the contract must specify the transfers on specific tiles.\n\nLet’s define the agreed movements:\n\nWe both start at (0,0).\n\nSuppose we both move to (0,1) — but (0,1) is Blue. I need a Blue chip to move there — I don’t have any.\n\nSo unless they give me a Blue chip **at (0,0)**, I cannot move to (0,1).\n\nBut (0,0) is Green — no cost to stay, but we can trade at any"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"
