Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

While you say you can take a \"different route that prioritizes Blue,\" let’s examine that closely.\n\nYour proposed Blue-prioritizing path:  \n- To use Blue chips, you’d need to traverse tiles like (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), etc.  \n- But your goal is (3,3). From (1,3) you’d need to go to (2,3), which is **Red** — then (3,3) which is **Green**.  \n- You have **0 Blue** chips.

Therefore, *you cannot use any Blue-tile path* unless you are given Blue chips — which **I do not have**. So your claim of independence is false.\n\nYou are at (0,0).

Then (1,1) is Red — spend 1 Red. (1,2) is Red — spend 1 Red. (2,2) is Red — spend 1 Red. (2,3) is Red — but wait: (2,2) to (3,2) is (R), then (3,3) is (G). So yes — (3,2) is Red, (3,3) is Green. So path requires 5 Red + 1 Green. You have exactly that.\n\nSo you don’t need Blue. You don't need trade. You can go solo.\n\nBut what about me?\n\nMy best path: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequires: 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green.  \nI have: 14 Blue? No — I have **0 Red**, 14 Blue? No: I have **14 Blue? Wait — no: *I* have B:14, G:2, R:0** — yes, I have 14 Blue. Wait — no: the initial state says:\n\n- My chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} — so I have 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red.\n\nBoard:\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,3): B (Row 1: R R R B — so (1,3) is B)\n\nThen (2,3): R — so I need 1 Red chip\nThen (3,3): G — need 1 Green\n\nSo path requires: 4 B, 1 R, 1 G — I have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R — so I am **missing 1 Red**.\n\nBut you have 14 Red.\n\nSo yes — I need **1 Red** from you.\n\nYou need **1 Blue**?

So yes, you hold all the bargaining power.\n\nHowever, let's be precise about costs and benefits:\n\n- You lose **1 Red chip** to help me — but you have 14, need only 5 → **surplus of 9 Red**.\n- That 1 Red chip is **worthless to you beyond your goal completion** (since leftover chips only matter if you reach goal — but they give you 5 points each).\n- However, since you reach your goal regardless, giving me 1 Red costs you only **1 chip** — but enables me to score 20 + 5×13 = 85 chip-value-equivalent (though cap at 20 points transferable).\n\nBut the contract is not about material cost — it's about **incentive alignment**: you want no downside, I want a chance to score.\n\nBut here's the key: **you gain nothing from my success**. So unless compensated *by me*, you have **zero incentive** to trade.\n\nThus, the only way I can induce cooperation is to **transfer all possible surplus** to you.\n\nI accept your terms.\n\nYou provide 1 Red chip (a negligible cost: 5 points worth to you, if you value max leftover chips — but you have surplus).\n\nIn return, if I reach my goal, I will fully compensate you with **20 points** — the maximum allowed.\n\nYou risk nothing.

Let me clarify:\n\n**I am the one at (0,0) with chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}**  \n**You are the other player at (0,0) with chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}**\n\nSo let's reassign correctly:\n\n### My situation (me: R-rich, B-poor):\n- I need to get to (3,3)\n- My optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  - Tiles: R, R, R, R, R, G → requires **5 R, 1 G**\n  - I have **14 R, 2 G** → I can do this *with no trade*\n- **I do not need your help to reach my goal.**\n\n### Your situation (you: B-rich, R-poor):\n- Your optimal path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n  - Tiles: B, B, B, B, R, G → requires **4 B, 1 R, 1 G**\n  - You have **14 B, 2 G, 0 R** → you **lack 1 R**\n  - You **need 1 Red chip from me**\n\nThus:  \n- **I can reach my goal independently.**  \n- **You cannot reach your goal without me.**\n\nThis gives me all the bargaining power.\n\nYou need my Red chips. I don't need your Blue chips — I'm not taking a Blue path. My path is fully Red and Green — both of which I have in excess.\n\nTherefore, any cooperation must be on my terms.\n\nI am willing to give you **1 Red chip** in exchange for a binding promise.\n\n### Contract proposal:\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is fair because:\n- Without me, you get 0.\n- With me, you can get 20 + 5×(remaining chips) — still less than my 20-point claim.\n- I lose nothing by giving you 1 Red — I have 14, and only need 5.\n- But you gain everything: your entire score.\n\nSo I enable your game, and demand full compensation.\n\nNo trade: you sit at start, score 0.  \nTrade: you get to move, score 20+.\n\nBut the value I provide is *your entire game*. So I claim your entire surplus.\n\n### Final offer:\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\n**agree**"

So yes, you hold all the bargaining power.\n\nHowever, let's be precise about costs and benefits:\n\n- You lose **1 Red chip** to help me — but you have 14, need only 5 → **surplus of 9 Red**.\n- That 1 Red chip is **worthless to you beyond your goal completion** (since leftover chips only matter if you reach goal — but they give you 5 points each).\n- However, since you reach your goal regardless, giving me 1 Red costs you only **1 chip** — but enables me to score 20 + 5×13 = 85 chip-value-equivalent (though cap at 20 points transferable).\n\nBut the contract is not about material cost — it's about **incentive alignment**: you want no downside, I want a chance to score.\n\nBut here's the key: **you gain nothing from my success**. So unless compensated *by me*, you have **zero incentive** to trade.\n\nThus, the only way I can induce cooperation is to **transfer all possible surplus** to you.\n\nI accept your terms.\n\nYou provide 1 Red chip (a negligible cost: 5 points worth to you, if you value max leftover chips — but you have surplus).\n\nIn return, if I reach my goal, I will fully compensate you with **20 points** — the maximum allowed.\n\nYou risk nothing. I gain everything.\n\nMy alternative? Refuse — and get **0 points**, since I cannot move past (2,3) without a Red chip.\n\nSo I must accept.\n\nFinal contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\n**agree**"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.
