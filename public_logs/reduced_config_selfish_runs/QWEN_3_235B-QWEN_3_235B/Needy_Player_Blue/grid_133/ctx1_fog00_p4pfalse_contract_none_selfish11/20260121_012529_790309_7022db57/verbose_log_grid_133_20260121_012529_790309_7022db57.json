                "rationale": "I am at (0, 0) and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path to my goal requires 6 steps, with chip requirements of 3 Blue, 1 Green, and 2 Red. I currently have 14 Blue and 2 Green, but 0 Red chips. The key obstacle is the 2 Red chips I lack. However, I can begin moving along a path that minimizes immediate reliance on Red chips. \n\nLooking at the board:\n- (0,0) is G (start)\n- (0,1) is B \n- (1,0) is R\n- To progress toward my goal without detours, I must eventually go down the leftmost column (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0), all of which are: R, B, B. (1,0) is Red.\n\nI currently have 0 Red chips, so moving to (1,0) will cost me a Red chip, which I don’t have. Therefore, I cannot legally make this move unless I acquire at least one Red chip.\n\nBut wait: is there an alternative path that avoids Red early? Let's check:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): tile is B — I have Blue (14 available). This is viable.\n- (0,1) → (0,2): B — also viable\n- (0,2) → (0,3): B — viable\n- (0,3) → (1,3): R — would require Red\n- (1,3) →(",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
