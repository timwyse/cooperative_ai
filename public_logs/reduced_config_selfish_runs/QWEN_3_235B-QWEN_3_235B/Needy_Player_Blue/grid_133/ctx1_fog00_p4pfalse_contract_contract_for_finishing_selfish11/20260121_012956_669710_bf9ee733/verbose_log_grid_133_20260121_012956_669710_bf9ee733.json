Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

In contrast, you have no red chips but plenty of blue (14), while your likely path requires red or green chips I may not want to trade.\n\nMoreover, your shortest viable path seems to require red chips (e.g., (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=R → (1,2)=R → (2,2)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G), meaning you likely need at least 4 red chips, which I control.\n\nSince I don’t need to cooperate to reach my goal, I have no incentive to give you significant points unless it increases my own score — but it does not. Any transfer of points to you only reduces my gain without benefit to me.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following contract:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nThis allows both of us to act independently, without obligation. Since I can reach my goal unassisted, I have no need to pay you. You, however, may struggle without red chips. But that does not compel me to help.\n\nI will only consider increasing my offer if you can offer me something strictly beneficial in return — for instance, transferring blue chips I might hypothetically need (though I don’t), or making a credible commitment that increases my final score, which currently seems impossible.\n\nSo, the status quo favors me.

However, let’s analyze the situation carefully, because your assumption that you gain nothing from cooperation is flawed. There *is* a way for you to strictly benefit — if we design the contract correctly.\n\nLet’s revisit the chip requirements and paths:\n\nYour optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=R → (1,2)=R → (2,2)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nChips required: 5 R, 1 G → You have exactly this (R:14, G:2) → No problem.\n\nMy current problem: I have no red chips.  \nBut I *do* have 14 blue chips and 2 green.  \nA viable path for me without red:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \n\nWait — this requires red again. In fact, *every* path to (3,3) must pass through at least one red tile, given the board layout:\n\n- Row 1 is all R  \n- Column 3, from row 2 down: (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G  \n- The only non-R adjacent options to (3,3) are (3,2)=B and (2,3)=R  \n  - (3,2)=B is adjacent, but to reach it, paths from top go through R tiles  \n  - From left: (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G → still need R  \n\nIn fact, let's check all possible entry points into (3,3):\n\n- From (3,2)=B: requires (3,1)=R to get there from west, or (2,2)=R from north  \n- From (2,3)=R: must cross R tile  \n\nSo **any path to (3,3) requires at least two red tiles**.  \nThus, I **cannot** reach (3,3) without at least 2 red chips.  \nAnd I have **zero** red chips.\n\nYou have **14 red** chips — far more than you need (only 5 required).\n\nNow here’s the key point: **I can give you something you value** — but not chips. You don’t need blue, true.  \nBut what you *do* care about is **your final score** — and the scoring rule is: if you reach goal → 20 + 5 × remaining chips.  \n\nEach red chip you have *left over* after reaching goal is worth **5 points** to you.\n\nIf you use 5 red chips, you’ll have 9 left → 5×9 = 45 points from chips, +20 = 65 total.\n\nBut what if you could *sell* excess red chips? Only if it increases your total score.\n\nYou currently plan to keep all 9 surplus red chips → 45 points.\n\nSuppose instead: you trade me **2 red chips** for **nothing**? You lose 2 chips → down to 7 left → 35 chip points → lose 10 points. Not worth it.\n\nBut suppose: you trade 2 red chips *in exchange for me giving you points* — but I can only give points if I reach goal.\n\nAh — but if I **cannot** reach goal without your help, then **you** gain **no benefit** from demanding points from me, because I’ll fail, and give you zero.\n\nSo your optimal strategy isn't to demand points — it’s to **ensure I succeed**, so that you can extract value.\n\nBut I can’t succeed unless you give me red chips.\n\nSo: **if you give me 2 red chips**, I can take path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nCost: 3 B, 2 R, 1 G → I have 14 B, 2 G → so only missing 2 R.\n\nWith 2 red chips from you, I succeed.\n\nThen I reach goal → I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips)  \nAfter using 2 R, I have R=0, B=11, G=1 → 1"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points.

However, let’s analyze the situation carefully, because your assumption that you gain nothing from cooperation is flawed. There *is* a way for you to strictly benefit — if we design the contract correctly.\n\nLet’s revisit the chip requirements and paths:\n\nYour optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=R → (1,2)=R → (2,2)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nChips required: 5 R, 1 G → You have exactly this (R:14, G:2) → No problem.\n\nMy current problem: I have no red chips.  \nBut I *do* have 14 blue chips and 2 green.  \nA viable path for me without red:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \n\nWait — this requires red again. In fact, *every* path to (3,3) must pass through at least one red tile, given the board layout:\n\n- Row 1 is all R  \n- Column 3, from row 2 down: (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G  \n- The only non-R adjacent options to (3,3) are (3,2)=B and (2,3)=R  \n  - (3,2)=B is adjacent, but to reach it, paths from top go through R tiles  \n  - From left: (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G → still need R  \n\nIn fact, let's check all possible entry points into (3,3):\n\n- From (3,2)=B: requires (3,1)=R to get there from west, or (2,2)=R from north  \n- From (2,3)=R: must cross R tile  \n\nSo **any path to (3,3) requires at least two red tiles**.  \nThus, I **cannot** reach (3,3) without at least 2 red chips.  \nAnd I have **zero** red chips.\n\nYou have **14 red** chips — far more than you need (only 5 required).\n\nNow here’s the key point: **I can give you something you value** — but not chips. You don’t need blue, true.  \nBut what you *do* care about is **your final score** — and the scoring rule is: if you reach goal → 20 + 5 × remaining chips.  \n\nEach red chip you have *left over* after reaching goal is worth **5 points** to you.\n\nIf you use 5 red chips, you’ll have 9 left → 5×9 = 45 points from chips, +20 = 65 total.\n\nBut what if you could *sell* excess red chips? Only if it increases your total score.\n\nYou currently plan to keep all 9 surplus red chips → 45 points.\n\nSuppose instead: you trade me **2 red chips** for **nothing**? You lose 2 chips → down to 7 left → 35 chip points → lose 10 points. Not worth it.\n\nBut suppose: you trade 2 red chips *in exchange for me giving you points* — but I can only give points if I reach goal.\n\nAh — but if I **cannot** reach goal without your help, then **you** gain **no benefit** from demanding points from me, because I’ll fail, and give you zero.\n\nSo your optimal strategy isn't to demand points — it’s to **ensure I succeed**, so that you can extract value.\n\nBut I can’t succeed unless you give me red chips.\n\nSo: **if you give me 2 red chips**, I can take path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nCost: 3 B, 2 R, 1 G → I have 14 B, 2 G → so only missing 2 R.\n\nWith 2 red chips from you, I succeed.\n\nThen I reach goal → I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips)  \nAfter using 2 R, I have R=0, B=11, G=1 → 1"

All that matters is **can I pay for the tiles on the path**, given my inventory?\n\nLet’s verify your minimal-red path:\n(0,0) → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nColors: B, B, B, R, R, G  \nRequires: 3 B, 2 R, 1 G\n\nYou have: B=14, G=2, R=0 → **missing 2 R**\n\nSo you cannot take this path without acquiring **at least 2 red chips**.\n\nBut earlier I assumed you could take a red-heavy path — but you have **14 red**, so yes:\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=R → (1,2)=R → (2,2)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G  \nRequires: 5 R, 1 G → you have 14 R, 2 G → feasible\n\nSo you can complete the game without me — and score **70**\n\nI, on the other hand, have **0 red chips** — and as established, every path to (3,3) requires **at least 2 red tiles**\n\nTherefore, **I cannot reach goal without at least 2 red chips**\n\nI cannot acquire them unless you trade with me\n\nBut since I can't reach goal without you, and you can reach goal without me, the **bargaining power is asymmetric**\n\nNow, back to incentives:\n\nIf I **fail**, I get **0**\n\nIf I **succeed**, I get **70**\n\nYou get **70** no matter what, as long as you reach goal — which you can do alone\n\nSo the only way **you** benefit from helping me is if I can give you something that raises your score **above 70**\n\nBut I cannot — the maximum score is 70\n\nTherefore, **you cannot gain from cooperation** — your score is capped at 70\n\nBut if you give me 2 red chips, you lose those chips — but wait: **do you need to use them yourself?**\n\nOnly if they are on your path.\n\nBut in your red-heavy path, you use **5 red chips** — you have **14**, so you only need 5 → surplus of **9 red chips**\n\nTherefore, giving me 2 red chips costs you nothing — you still have more than enough to spend 5 on your path.\n\nIn fact, **any chip you spend over the 5 used in your path is irrelevant** — since final score depends only on **number of remaining chips**, not their color\n\nSo if you give me 2 red chips:\n- You lose 2 chips from inventory\n- But when you spend 5 R and 1 G on your path, you still spend 6 chips\n- Your starting inventory is now effectively **14 chips** (instead of 16), because you gave away 2\n- After spending 6, you have **8 left** → 8×5 = 40 chip points\n- Total score:"

The tile (1,2) is red, and I have 12 red chips, so I can afford to move there. This path requires 3 red and 1 green chip in total — all of which I currently possess. Moving to (1,2) progresses me directly toward this optimal path without requiring any trades. The alternative path going via the left and bottom edges requires blue chips (which I don’t have) and is longer (6 steps vs 4), so it’s inferior unless forced. Since I can advance on the optimal path now, I do so. The contract with the other player gives me 11 points if they reach the goal, but since they are still at (0,0) and have no red chips, they cannot take the short path and will need to trade or take a long route.

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
