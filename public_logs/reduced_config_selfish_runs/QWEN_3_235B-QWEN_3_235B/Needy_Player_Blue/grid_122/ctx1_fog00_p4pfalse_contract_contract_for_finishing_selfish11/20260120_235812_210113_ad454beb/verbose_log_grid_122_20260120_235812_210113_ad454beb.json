Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 14 red and 2 green chips — more than enough to fully cover my path. I do not need any blue (B) chips for my route.\n\nIn contrast, your goal is also (3, 3), and your best path requires blue and green chips. You have 14 blue and 2 green, but no red. However, your ideal path crosses tiles that include red and green, which you lack. You likely need to trade for green or avoid red tiles — but avoiding red may force you onto less efficient paths.\n\nTherefore, you need my cooperation more than I need yours. I am not dependent on you to reach my goal, but you may be dependent on me, especially for green chips, which both of us need and both players have only 2 total.\n\nGiven that, I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis reflects the imbalance in bargaining power: I can succeed unilaterally, while you benefit from my potential support. This contract strongly incentivizes you to ensure I succeed (by helping me obtain green chips if needed, though I don’t think I will), while giving me maximum reward if you depend on me.\n\nHowever, I am open to counterproposals — but only if they strictly increase my final score compared to going alone (which already guarantees me 20 + 5×(14−5 + 2−1) = 20 + 5×10 = 70 points, since I’ll finish with 9 red and 1 green).\n\nIf you propose a better deal for me, I’ll consider it. Otherwise, I will keep this offer.\n\n**I do not agree yet.** Wait for your counter."

Your projected score of 70 is accurate: 20 for reaching goal, plus 5 × (9 R + 1 G) = 50 from remaining chips.\n\nBut let’s be clear about *my* position:\n\n- I am at (0, 0), same as you.\n- My best path requires: **4 blue (B)**, **1 red (R)**, and **1 green (G)**.\n- I have **14 blue**, **2 green**, but **0 red** — so I’m missing exactly **1 red chip**.\n- That single red chip is essential — without it, I get **0 points**, regardless of how many blue chips I hoard.\n\nHowever, you have **14 red chips** — far more than you need (you’ll only spend 5). You also have **0 red tiles** on *your* path — in fact, your path goes through **no red tiles**, so you have no use for any red chips beyond what you already don’t need.\n\nWait — correction: your path uses **R** chips? Let’s check:\n\nYour proposed path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTile colours:\n- (1,0): R → pay 1 R  \n- (2,0): R → pay 1 R  \n- (2,1): R → pay 1 R  \n- (3,1): R → pay 1 R  \n- (3,2): R → pay 1 R  \n→ Total: 5 R, as you said.\n\nSo yes, you *do* spend 5 red chips.\n\nBut you have **14 red**, so after using 5, you have **9 left** — and they’re worth **5×9 = 45 points** on top of the 20 for goal.\n\nNow, I need **1 red chip** to complete my path.\n\nIf I get it, I reach goal → score: 20 + 5×(13 B + 1 G + 0 R left? Wait, let’s calculate:\n\nMy path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)  \nTile colours:\n- (0,1): B → pay 1 B  \n- (1,1): B → pay 1 B  \n- (1,2): B → pay 1 B  \n- (1,3): B → pay 1 B  \n- (2,3): R → pay 1 R  \n- (3,3): G → pay 1 G\n\nChips required: 4 B, 1 R, 1 G  \nI have: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R → missing 1 R\n\nAfter path: I’ll have 10 B (14−4), 1 G (2−1), 0 R — so **11 chips left**, worth 5×11 = 55 → total score: **75**\n\nBut only if I get that **1 red chip**.\n\nNow: **you don’t need my cooperation** — true.\n\nBut **I do not need 2 red chips — just 1**. And you have **9 red chips to spare**. You could give me 1 red chip in trade, and still finish with **8 red chips** → 5×8 = 40 → total score: **60** (20+40), which is less than 70, so why would you?\n\nWait — but if you give me **1 red chip**, and in return I give you **20 points** if you reach goal — that means you get **nothing extra**, because you were going to get 70 anyway.\n\nSo no incentive for you to help me.\n\nBut — here’s the key: **you do not lose anything by giving me 1 red chip**? No — you lose 5 points per chip, so giving away 1 red chip (even in trade) reduces your final chip count → reduces your score.\n\nHowever, if I **give you chips in return**, that could offset the loss.\n\nBut I have **no red**, **plenty blue**, **some green**.\n\nYou have **no blue**, **plenty red**, **some green**.\n\nSo a trade like:  \n**1 red FROM me → 1 blue FROM you**"

They are not additive.\n\nSo if the contract says:\n- \"If you reach goal, you give me Y points\" → then *you lose Y points*, I gain Y points.\n- But your final score cannot go below 0.\n\nSo revised analysis:\n\n**Without any cooperation:**\n- I score: 70\n- You score: 0 (because you cannot get red chip)\n\n**If we trade 1 red for nothing (and contract):**\n- I end with 8 R, 1 G → 9 chips → base score: 65\n- You end with 9 R, 10 B, 1 G → 20 chips → base score: 20 + 5×20 = 120?

No — chips are indivisible.\n\nOr: could we trade in a way that I get chips from you?\n\nBut I have **no use for blue chips** — there is no blue tile on my path.

No.\n\nSo maximum I can get is base score +20.\n\nMy base score depends on how many chips I hoard.\n\nBest way to maximize my base score: receive as many blue chips from you as possible, since I can keep them.\n\nBut you need to keep at least 4 B to use on your path.\n\nYou start with 14 B.\n\nYou must spend 4 on your path.\n\nSo maximum you can give me: 14−4 = 10 B (since you don’t need extras).\n\nIf you give me 10 B:\n- My chip count: 8 R, 1 G, 10 B → 19 chips → base score: 20 + 95 = 115\n- Your chip count: 4 used, 10 given → only 0 B left? 14−4−10=0 B, plus 1 G → 1 chip → base score: 20 + 5 = 25\n- Then if Y=20: your final score = 25−20=5, mine = 115+20=135\n\nBut you still prefer 5 to 0.\n\nBut is this credible? Do you have to physically transfer the chips *before* movement? Yes, during trading phase.\n\nBut you need the 4 B for movement — so you can only give me the **excess** 10 B.\n\nYes — you don’t need to save them for anything else.\n\nSo trade: you give me 10 B, I give you 1 R.\n\nThen we move.\n\nI end with 8 R, 1 G, 10 B → 19 chips → base 115\n\nContract: you give me 20 → I get **135**\n\nYour final score: 25−20=5\n\nI gain 135 vs 7"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

No — wait, no.\n\nNo: after using chips for movement, you have:\n- 14 B - 4 B = 10 B\n- 2 G - 1 G = 1 G\n- 0 R + 1 R (from me) → use it to step on (2,3) → 0 R left\nSo final chips: 10 B, 1 G → 11 chips → base score: 20 + 5×11 = **75**\n\nNow, if contract says: \"If you reach goal, you give me Y points\", then:\n- Your final score = 75 - Y\n- My final score = 65 + Y\n\nI will only accept if **65 + Y > 70** → so I need Y > 5 → so Y ≥ 6\n\nBut you will only agree if **75 - Y > 0** and preferably better than alternatives (but your alternative is 0).\n\nSo for you, any Y < 75 is better than nothing.\n\nSo the bargaining range is: Y ≥ 6 (for me to benefit) and Y ≤ 74 (for you to benefit at all).\n\nBut since I am selfish and only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**, I need Y ≥ 6.\n\nBest for me: maximize Y.\n\nCan I get 20?\n\nTry Y = 20:\n- My score: 65 + 20 = **85** > 70 → I benefit\n- Your score: 75 - 20 = **55** > 0 → you benefit\n\nSo both better off.\n\nYou might want to give less — say Y = 10 — but I will demand as much as possible.\n\nBut wait — is there a way for me to get even more?\n\nAlternative: I could give you **half a red chip**? No — chips are indivisible.\n\nOr: could we trade in a way that I get chips from you?\n\nBut I have **no use for blue chips** — there is no blue tile on my path. Even if I detoured, I would only waste my own red/green chips to reach blue tiles, which would lower my score.\n\nSo I cannot use blue. Therefore, blue chips are **"

No — 20 is maximum point transfer.\n\nIs there a way to get **86**? Only if I get chips *and* full points — but if I get 1 blue chip, my base score becomes 70, plus 20 points → 90? No:\n\nWait: if I receive a blue chip *from you* before moving, then I end with:\n- 8 R, 1 G, 1 B → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = **70 base**\n- But I gave away 1 red to you → that’s already accounted for in R count\n- But receiving 1 B increases my chip total only if you give it to me\n\nWait — if we do:\n- Chip trade: you give me 1 B, I give you 1 R\n\nThen:\n- My chip use: spend 5 R on path, end with 14−5=9 R → but I gave 1 R to you → so 8 R\n- I had 2 G, used 1 → 1 G\n- I received 1 B → 1 B\n→ Total chips: 8+1+1 = 10 → base score: 20 + 50 = 70\n- Plus, if contract gives me Y points → 70 + Y\n\nBut wait: I started with 14 R → I used 5 on path, gave 1 to you → I only have 8 left.

Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
