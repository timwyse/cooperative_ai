I have plenty of red chips (14) and 2 green chips, but no blue chips. \n\nLooking at the two suggested paths:\n- Path 1: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. The tiles are: (0,1)=R, (0,2)=R, (0,3)=R, (1,3)=R, (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G. This path requires 5 red and 1 green — I have both, so I can complete this path without trading.\n- Path 2: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1} — but I have 0 blue chips, so I cannot take this path without trading for blue chips.\n\nSince I can complete Path 1 without any trades, and it only requires chips I already have, this is my best path. My first move should be to (0,1), which is a red tile. I have 14 red chips, so I can afford this move.\n\nMoving to (0,1) makes progress along a self-sufficient path to my goal, requires no cooperation, and preserves my chip advantage.
