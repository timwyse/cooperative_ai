No need to trade. Confirmed.\n\nNow me: I’m at (0,0), goal (3,3), chips: B:14, G:2, R:0  \nYour suggested path for me was: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTile colors:  \n- (0,1): B → pay 1B  \n- (0,2): B → pay 1B  \n- (1,2): B → pay 1B  \n- (1,3): B → pay 1B  \n- (2,3): B → pay 1B  \n- (3,3): G → pay 1G  \n\nTotal: 5B + 1G — I have B:14, G:2 → I can also do this path **without trading**.\n\nWait.\n\n**Both of us can reach the goal independently.**\n\nI require 5B + 1G → I have enough.  \nI finish with 14 - 5 = 9B, 2 - 1 = 1G, total 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nYou finish with 14 - 0 = 14B?

To go to (1,0) which is R, you need to pay 1 red chip.  \nBut you have R:0 — **you cannot make that move**.\n\nSo your claim is false. You **cannot** reach your goal via the red path without at least 5 red chips.\n\nNow, is there a path using only chips you **have**?\n\nYou have B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nLet’s find any path from (0,0) to (3,3) using only B and G (since you have no R).\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1)=B → pay B → ok  \n(0,1) → (0,2)=B → pay B  \n(0,2) → (1,2)=B → pay B  \n(1,2) → (1,3)=B → pay B  \n(1,3) → (2,3)=B → pay B  \n(2,3) → (3,3)=G → pay G\n\nTotal: 5B + 1G → you have B:14, G:2 → **yes, this works.**\n\nSo you **can** reach your goal **without red chips** — using the blue/green path.\n\nThis path requires: 5B + 1G → you can afford it.\n\nYou will end with: B:14-5=9, G:2-1=1, R:0 → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAnd I can also go via the red path: require 5R + 1G → I have"

So no shorter.\n\nThus, **no benefit** to trading or helping — both of us can reach goal independently, in minimal steps, with high leftover chips.\n\nTherefore, **any cooperation only makes sense if it increases my final score**.\n\nBut since I already get 70 points on my own, and helping you gives me nothing unless you pay me, and I gain nothing from helping you (you don't have red chips that I need), **there is no incentive for me to cooperate**.\n\nLikewise, since you don’t need my red chips, **you don’t need me**.\n\nSo here’s the only contract that makes sense for me:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I give you **0 points** (since I don’t need your help)\n- If you reach your goal, you give me **0 points** (since I don’t help you in any way)\n\nBut even this is generous — I don’t owe you anything.\n\nBut to avoid conflict (e.g., blocking paths), perhaps we can agree on non-interference.\n\nBut note: both paths are on opposite sides of the board — I go down the left/middle, you go along the top/right — **no tile conflict**.\n\nSo **no risk of blocking**.\n\nThus, **no need"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
