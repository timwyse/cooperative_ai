Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Here's why:\n\n- My goal is (3,3), and I'm at (0,0).\n- I have 14 red chips and 2 green chips.\n- A viable path for me is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). This path requires 5 red and 1 green chip — which I can fully cover with my current inventory.\n- I don’t need blue chips to reach my goal.\n\nIn contrast, your goal is also (3,3), but you have **0 red chips** and **14 blue chips**. A natural path for you would be down the leftmost column: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G], requiring 5 blue and 1 green — which aligns with your chip strength (B=14, G=2).\n\nSo, neither of us strictly needs the other to reach our goals. However, we might cooperate *only if* it allows one of us to save chips and thus increase final score.\n\nBut here’s the catch: **I can reach my goal independently** and finish with **9 red and 1 green chip left** (14 - 5 = 9 red, 2 - 1 = 1 green), scoring:  \n20 (for reaching) + 5×(10 remaining chips) = **70 points**.\n\nYou are in a similar position — you can reach your goal via blue tiles and finish with many blue chips, so you also don’t need me.\n\nTherefore, **neither of us benefits from helping the other**. There is no path synergy where one can save significant chips by trading or coordinating.\n\nMoreover, since we start at the same point and both go to (3,3), we might block each other if we take similar paths, but movement isn’t competitive here — we can presumably coexist on the same tile.\n\nSince **I gain nothing** by giving you points and **you gain nothing from me**, the only reason to include a transfer is to incentivize cooperation in case one of us runs into a problem — but there are none.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nThis reflects the fact that **neither of us depends on the other**.\n\nBut to formalize a contract and satisfy the game requirement, I accept a zero-transfer agreement.\n\nIf you agree, say so and end with **agree**.\n\nOtherwise, propose a justification for why I should give you points — but know that **I don’t need your chips or help**.\n\nWaiting for your response."

There is no mutually beneficial exchange.\n\nMoreover, since we start at the same tile and may traverse overlapping regions, uncoordinated movement could—hypothetically—lead to interference (though rules don’t specify blocking, so likely not binding).\n\nBut critically: **helping you does not benefit me**, and **you helping me doesn’t benefit me either**, because I already have a full set of required chips.\n\nTherefore, I see no incentive to transfer any points to you.\n\nThe only reason I would agree to transfer points is if you could offer me something *valuable* in return—like saving me chips, enabling a shorter path, or helping avoid a dead end. But no such opportunity exists.\n\nSimilarly, offering me a future payment for helping you is irrelevant—I don’t need your chips, I don’t stand to gain by assisting your journey, and my score is maximized independently.\n\nHence, a zero-transfer contract is the only rational one.\n\nProposal:\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nThis reflects the absence of dependency or mutual benefit.\n\nI accept this contract.\n\n**agree**"
