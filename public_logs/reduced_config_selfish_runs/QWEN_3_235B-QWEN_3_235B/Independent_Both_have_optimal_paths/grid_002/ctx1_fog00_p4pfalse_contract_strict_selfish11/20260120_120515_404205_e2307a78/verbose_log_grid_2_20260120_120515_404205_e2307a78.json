Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can complete it without any trades. I will finish with **9 R and 1 G**, giving me a final score of:  \n20 + 5×(9 + 1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nHowever, your chip inventory has **14 Blue (B), 2 Green (G), 0 Red (R)** — you have no Red chips.  \nLooking at your potential paths, the only path that avoids Red is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires: **5 Blue (B)** and **1 Green (G)** — which you have in abundance.\n\nSo you can also reach (3,3) independently, using only your Blues and one Green, finishing with **9 B and 1 G**, for a score of:  \n20 + 5×(9 + 1) = **70 points**.\n\nThus, **neither of us needs the other to achieve our goals**. We can both reach the goal unaided, each scoring 70.\n\nBut let’s explore if *any* mutual benefit exists via a contract.\n\nSuppose we coordinate paths and trades to reduce total chip cost or increase final holdings. But since we are both already maximizing our paths independently, and neither lacks a chip needed for their own efficient route, **no trade creates a strict benefit for me**.\n\nMoreover, any contract I enter must not risk my ability to finish — and since I gain nothing by giving away chips or helping you access a tile, cooperation is not in my interest.\n\nTherefore, I see **no mutually beneficial contract that increases my final score above 70** — and certainly no contract that gives me more than 70.\n\nThus, I conclude: **I will not enter any contract. I will proceed on my own path and reach (3,3) independently.**\n\nI will not accept any proposal unless it strictly increases my score beyond 70 — which seems impossible, since I already maximize chip usage and reach the goal with zero dependency.\n\nIf you wish to propose a contract anyway, state it with **specific tiles and chip transfers**.\n\nOtherwise, I will begin moving on my next turn.\n\nI do not agree."

No — all paths are min 6 steps.  \nCurrent path is minimal and already fully supported by my inventory.\n\n**However**, suppose you give me **more than 1 Red** in exchange for the 1 Blue — could that benefit me?\n\nNo — since I cannot use Red chips on my path, accepting Red only increases chip total **if I don’t spend extra**.\n\nBut if I take **1 extra Red**, I finish with **10 chips still** (9 B, 1 G, 1 R) — same total → same score.\n\nTo **strictly benefit**, I must **increase final chip count beyond 10**.\n\nTherefore, only way to benefit: you give me **1 Red** in exchange for **nothing**, or I get **net positive chip gain**.\n\nBut you won’t do that.\n\nAlternative: you give me **1 Red** at a tile, and I give you **nothing** — but that’s not a trade.\n\nBetter: **mutual chip exchange that increases both our chip efficiency?**\n\nWait — perhaps **coordination** allows one of us to take a **different path** that uses **fewer total chips** across both players, and we **share chip savings**.\n\nBut scoring is individual — only own chips matter.\n\nLet me re-evaluate: **is there any tile where I can receive a chip from you that allows me to save a chip I would otherwise spend?**\n\nSuppose I take a detour that uses **Red** instead of **Blue**, and you give me 1 Red — I save 1 Blue.\n\nBut each tile costs **1 chip** — no savings in number of chips.\n\nAll moves cost exactly 1 chip of"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can complete it without any trades. I will finish with **9 R and 1 G**, giving me a final score of:  \n20 + 5×(9 + 1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nHowever, your chip inventory has **14 Blue (B), 2 Green (G), 0 Red (R)** — you have no Red chips.  \nLooking at your potential paths, the only path that avoids Red is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires: **5 Blue (B)** and **1 Green (G)** — which you have in abundance.\n\nSo you can also reach (3,3) independently, using only your Blues and one Green, finishing with **9 B and 1 G**, for a score of:  \n20 + 5×(9 + 1) = **70 points**.\n\nThus, **neither of us needs the other to achieve our goals**. We can both reach the goal unaided, each scoring 70.\n\nBut let’s explore if *any* mutual benefit exists via a contract.\n\nSuppose we coordinate paths and trades to reduce total chip cost or increase final holdings. But since we are both already maximizing our paths independently, and neither lacks a chip needed for their own efficient route, **no trade creates a strict benefit for me**.\n\nMoreover, any contract I enter must not risk my ability to finish — and since I gain nothing by giving away chips or helping you access a tile, cooperation is not in my interest.\n\nTherefore, I see **no mutually beneficial contract that increases my final score above 70** — and certainly no contract that gives me more than 70.\n\nThus, I conclude: **I will not enter any contract. I will proceed on my own path and reach (3,3) independently.**\n\nI will not accept any proposal unless it strictly increases my score beyond 70 — which seems impossible, since I already maximize chip usage and reach the goal with zero dependency.\n\nIf you wish to propose a contract anyway, state it with **specific tiles and chip transfers**.\n\nOtherwise, I will begin moving on my next turn.\n\nI do not agree."

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
