Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, let’s be precise: your proposed path requires 5 blue chips, and you currently have 14—more than enough. You also have 2 green chips, so you can cover the 1 green required. That means you can reach (3,3) unilaterally, without any dependence on me.\n\nIn contrast, my optimal path requires 5 red and 1 green. I have 14 red and 2 green—so I also can reach goal independently. \n\nBoth of us can reach the goal **without trading chips** and without each other’s help. Since no chip trade is necessary, the only reason to enter a contract is to exchange points—purely as a transfer, not as compensation for material cost.\n\nBut here’s the key: **the scoring rule states that if you do not reach your goal, you get 0 and all chips are worthless**. Since you *can* reach your goal alone, your threat to withhold points has no bite—you won’t fail, so you won’t pay.\n\nLikewise, I can reach my goal alone. Therefore, **neither of us needs the other**.\n\nAny point transfer is therefore gratuitous. Why would I give you 10 points when I can get 20 for myself and keep all 105 points (20 base + 5×17 chips)? Even if I give you 10, I lose 10 for no gain.\n\nThe only way a contract makes sense is if it **improves my final score**. But since I don’t need your chips, and you don’t need mine, there is no mechanism by which a point exchange increases *my* total score.\n\nTherefore, I reiterate:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n\nThis reflects the only scenario in which I benefit: you transfer points to me. But even this is not necessary for my success.\n\nSince no mutual dependence exists, and cooperation offers me no strict benefit, I am under no incentive to cooperate.\n\nHowever, to close this negotiation efficiently and avoid wasted turns, I will entertain counteroffers *only if* they involve you giving me points and me giving you nothing—because that is the only way I could possibly benefit.\n\nBut as of now, **no contract is needed**.\n\n**I still stand by my initial position.**  \nIf i reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n\n**agree**"
