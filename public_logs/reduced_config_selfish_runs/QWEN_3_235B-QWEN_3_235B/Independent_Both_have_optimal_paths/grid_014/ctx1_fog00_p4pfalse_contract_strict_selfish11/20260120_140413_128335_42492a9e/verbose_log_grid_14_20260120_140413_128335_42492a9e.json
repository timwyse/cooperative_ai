Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's analyze the most efficient paths for each of us:\n\n### My optimal path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- **Tiles**: G, R, R, R, R, R, G  \n- **Chips needed**: 5 R, 1 G  \n- I **already have** this: 14 R, 2 G → I can complete this **without trading**.\n\n### Your optimal path:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- **Tiles**: G, B, B, B, B, B, G  \n- **Chips needed**: 5 B, 1 G  \n- You have this: 14 B, 2 G → you can **also** complete this without trading.\n\nSo both of us can **independently** reach the goal with our current chips.\n\nHowever, suppose either of us is forced to deviate (e.g., due to being blocked or changing plans) — but the rules don’t mention blocking, so we can both move freely on the board. Therefore, **no trade is necessary** for either of us.\n\nSince **I can reach my goal without your help**, and helping you would only benefit me if I gained something in return — but I gain nothing by giving you chips or assistance — **I do not need to cooperate**.\n\nBut let’s suppose you want to take *my* path. That would require **Red chips**, which you don’t have. You cannot complete (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), or (3,2) without R chips, and you have **0 R**.\n\nSimilarly, if I tried *your* path, I’d need 5 Blue chips — which I don’t have.\n\nSo **unless we trade, neither of us can use the other’s path**.\n\nBut again, **I don’t need to** — I can use my own path with my own chips.\n\nSo why trade?\n\nOnly if you propose something that **increases my final score beyond what I get by acting alone**, it’s worth considering.\n\nRight now, walking my path alone:\n- Reach goal: **yes**\n- Chips used: 5 R + 1 G → 14–5=9 R left, 2–1=1 G left\n- Final score: 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**\n\nIf I give away any chips to you, and receive nothing useful in return, my chip total goes down — lowering my score.\n\nIf I give you a Red chip, I still have 13 R — still more than enough — but unless getting something in return **allows me to reach goal with fewer chips** (which it doesn’t), it’s not worth it.\n\nBut wait — is there a *shorter* path?\n\nNo. Minimum steps to (3,3) is 6 — both our paths are 6 steps.\n\nSo **no efficiency gain** from switching paths.\n\nTherefore, **no mutually beneficial trade exists** that increases my score.\n\nI can reach goal without you. Helping you costs me chips, which reduces my score unless compensated.\n\nSo unless you **offer me chips** in return, I will not cooperate.\n\nBut you don’t need my chips — you have your own path.\n\nSo **no incentive for either of us to trade**.\n\nThus, I propose:\n\n> Let’s not trade at all. We each go our own way, using our own chips.\n\nBut if you insist on negotiating — and you **offer me additional chips** for no return — that would increase my score.\n\nFor example, if you give me **any chip** — say 1 Blue — without me giving anything in return, then at the end I have **one more chip**, so **+5 points**.\n\nSo here’s my **only acceptable contract**:\n\n(0,0): You give me a B  \n→ That’s it.

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).
