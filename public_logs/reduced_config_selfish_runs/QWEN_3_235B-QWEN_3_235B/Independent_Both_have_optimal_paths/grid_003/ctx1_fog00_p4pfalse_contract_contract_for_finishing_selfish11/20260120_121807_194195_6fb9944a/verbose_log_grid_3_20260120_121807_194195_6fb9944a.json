You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have 14 Red and 2 Green — yes, that is feasible.\n\nBut let’s be precise: your statement that *you do not need my help* is correct **only if** you can traverse the Red tiles without spending excess chips — which you can. So you are, indeed, independent.\n\nNow consider me:  \nMy current inventory: 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red.  \nMy ideal path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) — as given, this uses 5 Blue and 1 Green.

But I already have 2 Green chips, so even that is fine.\n\nSo **I can also reach my goal without any help**.\n\nMy cost: 5 Blue, 1 Green → remaining chips: 9 Blue, 1 Green → total 10 chips → score: 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nI do not need to trade with you. I do not need to step on any Red tiles. My entire path is Blue and ends on Green. I have all required chips.\n\nTherefore, **neither of us needs the other**.\n\nYou say: “I will give you 0 points if I reach my goal, you give me 20 if you reach yours.”\n\nBut why would I accept that? I gain nothing by agreeing. I can get 70 points alone. If I “give you 20 points”, does that mean I transfer 20 of my score to you? But the scoring rules don’t say I can transfer score — rather, the *contract* defines side payments.\n\nAh — clarification of contract semantics:  \nBased on context, \"give you X points\" means: if I reach my goal, I will forfeit X of my earned points and you receive them instead (or perhaps it's a binding side payment enforced by the game). So if I get 70, and I “give you 20”, then I end with 50, you end with your own score + 20.\n\nBut **scores are only realized if goal is reached**. So the transfer only occurs if both reach goals.\n\nIn this case, since both of us can reach goals independently, any transfer only reduces our individual scores unless compensated.\n\nSo your contract:  \n- If I succeed, I give you 20  \n- If you succeed, you give me 0  \n\nThat would result in:  \n- You: 70  \n- Me: 70 - 20 = 50  \n\nI lose 20. No benefit to me. I reject.\n\nYou gain nothing from helping me — but you’re offering zero compensation *to me* while demanding 20 from me.\n\nYou say you’re a selfish agent. So am I.\n\n**I counter with:**  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.  \n\nWe both go our own way, keep our full scores. **This is the only contract I will accept that doesn't harm me.**\n\nBut you proposed a transfer from me to you. You have no leverage.\n\nUnless... do we?\n\nWait — let’s double-check the **board layout**:\n\nRow 0: G B R R  \nRow 1: R B B B  \nRow 2: R R B B  \nRow 3: B R R G\n\nMy claimed path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,0): G — start, no cost  \n- (0,1): B — pay 1 Blue  \n- (1,1): B — pay 1 Blue  \n- (1,2): B — pay 1 Blue  \n- (2,2): B — pay 1 Blue  \n- (2,3): B —"
