My current chip count after the move will be 9 red and 1 green, totaling 10 chips, giving me a final score of 20 + (10 * 5) = 70 points. There is no benefit in delaying this move, and no need to trade with the other player since I already have the required chip. Moving now maximizes my score immediately and securely. The other player is at (2, 3), and if they also move to (3, 3), they may block or interfere, but since the goal tile is shared and reachable by both, and I can get there now, I should take the opportunity. I do not need to cooperate because I can succeed independently and immediately.",
