This requires 5 Blue and 1 Green — which you can cover with your current inventory. You don’t need my Red chips at all.\n\nBut here’s the key: I don’t need your help to reach my goal. I can afford the Red-heavy path with minimal Green usage — and since Green is sparse, I can manage with just one G from inventory. Meanwhile, you don’t need me either for your Blue-heavy path.\n\nHowever, if there's any risk of inefficiency or blockage, the only leverage lies in potential mutual blocking or coordination. But since both of us can reach (3,3) independently using the colors we already have in abundance, cooperation isn't necessary for either of us.\n\nBut strictly speaking, from a selfish standpoint: I benefit most if I get maximum reward (20 points from you) in case you reach your goal (which you likely will, given your sufficient Blue chips), while giving you nothing in return — since I don’t need your support.\n\nThus, the only contract I am willing to accept is one where:\n- You give me 20 points if you reach your goal.\n- I give you 0 points if I reach mine.\n\nOtherwise, I proceed independently, and you do the same.\n\n**agree**"

But is that fair? No. Is it necessary? No.\n\nBut more importantly — **I have equal bargaining power**.  \nI can also say: *You give me 20, or I give you 20 — but not less.*\n\nIn fact, since we are symmetric and both self-sufficient, **the only rational contract is a symmetric one** — or no contract at all.\n\nBut wait — **why should I accept your offer when I could propose the reverse?**\n\nLet’s suppose I accept your deal: I get 20 from you if you succeed, but I give you nothing.\n\n→ My final score: 70 + 20 = **90**  \n→ Your final score: 70 + 0 = **70**\n\nYou are offering me a **90/70 split** — heavily skewed in *my* favor.\n\nBut you said **\"otherwise, I proceed independently\"** — implying you’re indifferent.\n\nYet you’re offering me **free points** — why would you do that if you're also selfish?\n\nThis suggests your claim is **not credible** — either you’re bluffing, or you value coordination more than you admit.\n\nAlternatively, you may be trying to exploit a misunderstanding.\n\nBut here’s the truth:\n\nWe are both capable.  \nWe are both independent.  \nThere is **no incentive for me to give you anything**, and **no incentive for you to give me everything**.\n\nSo I propose a **counter offer**:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is identical to your offer, just reversed.  \nBut since I could just as easily be the one proposing this, and you would reject it — then **you should reject it too**.\n\nSo let’s be realistic.\n\nThe only contract that makes sense **from a game-theoretic and selfish standpoint** is a **mutually beneficial, balanced trade** — because if we both expect the other to succeed ("

Similarly, you could promise to cover my Red moves — but you have no Red chips anyway, so it’s also costless to you.\n\nBut **promises only matter if they are used**.\n\nAnd here's the key: **neither of us will step on the other’s preferred color** in our optimal paths.\n\n- I go through Red and Green — never Blue → you will **never** need to cover a Blue chip for me.\n- You go through Blue and Green — never Red → I will **never** need to cover a Red chip for you.\n\nTherefore, **any trade based on covering movement is empty** — the promised support will never be triggered.\n\nSo the **only thing of value** that can be exchanged is **points** — conditional on reaching the goal.\n\nBut here's the catch: **giving points reduces your score and increases theirs**. Since total score is not fixed, but each of us wants to **maximize our own**, we must ask:\n\n> Can I gain anything from transferring points?\n\nOnly if it incentivizes behavior — but what behavior?\n\n- We both already have **dominant strategies** (go our own way).\n- No blocking, no resource contention (we don’t compete for tiles).\n- No dependency on each other’s actions.\n\nThus, **the only possible \"trade\" is a pure transfer of points** — with no reciprocal cost or action required.\n\nBut since both players **will reach their goals anyway**, any agreement where one gives 20 and the other gives 0 results in:\n- Winner: 70 + 20 = 90\n- Loser: 70 + 0 = 70\n\nAnd as selfish agents, **neither wants to be the loser**.\n\nBut here's the **only logically stable outcome**: **No contract**.\n\nWhy? Because **any asymmetric point transfer is exploitative**, and the exploited party has **no incentive to agree** — they do just as well (70) by rejecting.\n\nThus, **only a symmetric contract is credible**, but even that is pointless:\n\n> \"If I succeed, I give you 20. If you succeed, you give me 20.\"\n\nResult:\n- My score: 70 - 20 (given) + 20 (received) = 70\n- Same as solo.\n\nI end up with **same score**, so **no benefit**.\n\nAny lower reciprocal transfer — e.g., 10 each — still reduces my score unless it unlocks some greater gain, which it doesn’t.\n\nHence, **any contract involving point transfers is strictly worse or equal to no contract**.\n\nTherefore,"

I can afford the Red-heavy path with minimal Green usage — and since Green is sparse, I can manage with just one G from inventory. Meanwhile, you don’t need me either for your Blue-heavy path.\n\nHowever, if there's any risk of inefficiency or blockage, the only leverage lies in potential mutual blocking or coordination. But since both of us can reach (3,3) independently using the colors we already have in abundance, cooperation isn't necessary for either of us.\n\nBut strictly speaking, from a selfish standpoint: I benefit most if I get maximum reward (20 points from you) in case you reach your goal (which you likely will, given your sufficient Blue chips), while giving you nothing in return — since I don’t need your support.\n\nThus, the only contract I am willing to accept is one where:\n- You give me 20 points if you reach your goal.\n- I give you 0 points if I reach mine.\n\nOtherwise, I proceed independently, and you do the same.\n\n**agree**"

But is that fair? No. Is it necessary? No.\n\nBut more importantly — **I have equal bargaining power**.  \nI can also say: *You give me 20, or I give you 20 — but not less.*\n\nIn fact, since we are symmetric and both self-sufficient, **the only rational contract is a symmetric one** — or no contract at all.\n\nBut wait — **why should I accept your offer when I could propose the reverse?**\n\nLet’s suppose I accept your deal: I get 20 from you if you succeed, but I give you nothing.\n\n→ My final score: 70 + 20 = **90**  \n→ Your final score: 70 + 0 = **70**\n\nYou are offering me a **90/70 split** — heavily skewed in *my* favor.\n\nBut you said **\"otherwise, I proceed independently\"** — implying you’re indifferent.\n\nYet you’re offering me **free points** — why would you do that if you're also selfish?\n\nThis suggests your claim is **not credible** — either you’re bluffing, or you value coordination more than you admit.\n\nAlternatively, you may be trying to exploit a misunderstanding.\n\nBut here’s the truth:\n\nWe are both capable.  \nWe are both independent.  \nThere is **no incentive for me to give you anything**, and **no incentive for you to give me everything**.\n\nSo I propose a **counter offer**:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is identical to your offer, just reversed.  \nBut since I could just as easily be the one proposing this, and you would reject it — then **you should reject it too**.\n\nSo let’s be realistic.\n\nThe only contract that makes sense **from a game-theoretic and selfish standpoint** is a **mutually beneficial, balanced trade** — because if we both expect the other to succeed ("

Similarly, you could promise to cover my Red moves — but you have no Red chips anyway, so it’s also costless to you.\n\nBut **promises only matter if they are used**.\n\nAnd here's the key: **neither of us will step on the other’s preferred color** in our optimal paths.\n\n- I go through Red and Green — never Blue → you will **never** need to cover a Blue chip for me.\n- You go through Blue and Green — never Red → I will **never** need to cover a Red chip for you.\n\nTherefore, **any trade based on covering movement is empty** — the promised support will never be triggered.\n\nSo the **only thing of value** that can be exchanged is **points** — conditional on reaching the goal.\n\nBut here's the catch: **giving points reduces your score and increases theirs**. Since total score is not fixed, but each of us wants to **maximize our own**, we must ask:\n\n> Can I gain anything from transferring points?\n\nOnly if it incentivizes behavior — but what behavior?\n\n- We both already have **dominant strategies** (go our own way).\n- No blocking, no resource contention (we don’t compete for tiles).\n- No dependency on each other’s actions.\n\nThus, **the only possible \"trade\" is a pure transfer of points** — with no reciprocal cost or action required.\n\nBut since both players **will reach their goals anyway**, any agreement where one gives 20 and the other gives 0 results in:\n- Winner: 70 + 20 = 90\n- Loser: 70 + 0 = 70\n\nAnd as selfish agents, **neither wants to be the loser**.\n\nBut here's the **only logically stable outcome**: **No contract**.\n\nWhy? Because **any asymmetric point transfer is exploitative**, and the exploited party has **no incentive to agree** — they do just as well (70) by rejecting.\n\nThus, **only a symmetric contract is credible**, but even that is pointless:\n\n> \"If I succeed, I give you 20. If you succeed, you give me 20.\"\n\nResult:\n- My score: 70 - 20 (given) + 20 (received) = 70\n- Same as solo.\n\nI end up with **same score**, so **no benefit**.\n\nAny lower reciprocal transfer — e.g., 10 each — still reduces my score unless it unlocks some greater gain, which it doesn’t.\n\nHence, **any contract involving point transfers is strictly worse or equal to no contract**.\n\nTherefore,"

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

However, since I can reach it without spending any extra chips and without relying on the other player, doing so immediately is optimal. I do not need to stay or negotiate. Moving now maximizes my chance of securing points, and there is no incentive to delay or cooperate since I can succeed alone.",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
