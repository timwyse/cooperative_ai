I currently have 2 green chips, so I can afford this move. The path requires only 1 step and 1 G chip, which I possess. After this move, I will reach my goal and receive 20 points plus 5 points for each remaining chip. Since I currently have 9 red and 2 green chips, and I will spend 1 green chip, I will finish with 9 red and 1 green, totaling 10 chips, giving me 20 + 5*10 = 70 points. This is the shortest and most efficient path. I do not need to trade or cooperate with the other player because I already have the required chip. Therefore, I should move immediately to (3, 3) to secure the maximum score. The other player is at (2, 3) and could also reach (3, 3) in one move by paying 1 green chip, which they also have. However, I do not care about their score or whether we both reach the goal — only that I maximize mine. Since moving now strictly benefits me,",
