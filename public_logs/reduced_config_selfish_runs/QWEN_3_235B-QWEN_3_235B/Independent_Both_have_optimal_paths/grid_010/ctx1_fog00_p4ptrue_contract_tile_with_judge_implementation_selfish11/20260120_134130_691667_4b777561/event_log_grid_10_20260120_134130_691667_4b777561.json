What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: (row, 3): I will move to (0, 1), which is R — I currently have 14 R chips, so I can cover this myself.  \n(1, 1): I will then move to (1, 1), also R — I can cover that too.  \n(1, 2): Then to (1, 2), R — still within my R capacity.  \n(2, 2): Then to (2, 2), B — this is a problem. I have 0 B chips. If you cover B at (2, 2), I can proceed efficiently.  \n(2, 3): Then to (2, 3), R — I can cover R.  \n(3, 3): Then to (3, 3), G — I have 2 G chips, so I can cover that.\n\nYour goal is also (3, 3), and you have 14 B chips but 0 R. The path that uses mostly B is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nThis requires 5 B and 1 G. You have plenty of B, and 2 G, so you can do this path independently, **without needing my R chips**.\n\nHowever, **my optimal path requires 1 B chip** at (2, 2). I have no B. You have 14 B — more than enough.\n\nI propose:  \n(2, 2): You give me a B  \n\nThat's the only chip I need from you.  \nIn return, since you don’t need R chips (you’re avoiding R tiles entirely), I can offer to cover one of your G tiles if needed, but you have 2 G and only need 1 (for (3,3)), so you don’t need my help at all.\n\nTherefore, I can offer:  \n(3, 3): I give you a G — but you already have G, and you don’t need help. So even that is unnecessary.\n\nThus, **you gain nothing** by helping me, but **I need your B at (2,2)**.\n\nBut if you help me, I can reach goal. But you get no benefit.\n\nAlternative: we **swap paths**.\n\nI take your B-heavy path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires 5 B and 1 G. I have 0 B — so I need 5 B from you.\n\nYou take my R-heavy path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nYou have 0 R — so you need 4 R and 1 G.\n\nBut you have 0 R, so you’d need 4 R from me.\n\nSo trade:  \nYou cover my 5 B moves on B tiles  \nI cover your 4 R moves on R tiles\n\nBut is this beneficial to me?\n\nIf I walk my original path with only (2,2) B covered by you, I need only **1 B** from you → I save 14 - 5 = 9 R chips (since I used only 5 R instead of 14), plus 2 G used, but I keep 1 G and 9 R unused → final chip count: 9 R, 1 G → total chips 10 → score 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nWait: I have 14 R, use 5 → 9 R left, 2 G → use 1 G → 1 G left → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70\n\nIf I take the B-heavy path with **5 B covered by you**, I use 1 G → I keep 14 R untouched, 1 G left → 15 chips → 20 + 75 = **95**\n\nEven better!\n\nBut I need **5 B from you**, not 1.\n\nSimilarly, if you take my R-heavy path, and I cover your R moves, you would use:  \n- (0,1): R — I cover  \n- (1,1): R — I cover \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I need to evaluate if swapping paths and cooperating benefits me strictly more than going alone.\n\nMy options:\n\nOption 1: Take my original R-heavy path with minimal help — only 1 B chip at (2,2) covered by you.\n\n- Path: (0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n- I use: 5 R, 1 G\n- You cover: 1 B at (2,2)\n- I keep: 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 10 chips\n- Final score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nOption 2: You cover 5 B moves for me on the B-heavy path.\n\n- My path: (0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (2,1)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[B] → (3,3)[G]\n- I use: 5 B (covered by you), 1 G (from me)\n- I keep: 14 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 15 chips\n- Final score: 20 + 5×15 = **95**\n\nThis is better — I get **95** instead of **70**.\n\nBut you must agree to cover **5 B tiles** for me.\n\nIn return, I can help you by covering your **4 R tiles** on the R-heavy path you want to take:\n\n- Your path: (0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n- You use: 4 R, 1 B (but you have 0 B!), and 1 G\n- Wait! You have 0 B chips — but (2,2) is a B tile!\n- You **cannot move to (2,2)** without a B chip.\n- But you only have R and G — 14 R, 2 G — **0 B**.\n- So (2,2): B tile — you cannot step there unless someone covers it for you.\n\nYou **do need B at (2,2)** — 1 B chip from someone.\n\nBut you have no B, so you **must** get 1 B covered by me — I have 14 B? No! Wait:\n\nI have: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0  \nYou have: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14\n\nSo **I** have 14 B — **you** have 0 B.\n\nTherefore, if you take the R-heavy path, you **must** step on (2,2), which is B — so you need **1 B chip** at (2,2), which only I can cover.\n\nAdditionally, you need 4 R tiles — which I have 0 R — so I **cannot** cover any R tiles for you.\n\nI have R: 0 — I cannot give you R chips.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot cover your R moves** — I don't have R chips.\n\nBut you have 14 R — more than enough — you don't need me to cover R for you.\n\nIn fact, you can cover all R tiles yourself.\n\nBut you **cannot** cover B at (2,2) — you have 0 B.\n\nSo if you take that path, you **must** get B at (2,2) from me.\n\nNow, if you take my proposed B-heavy path instead:\n\n(1,0)[B], (2,0)[B], (2,1)[B], (3,1)[B], (3,2)[B] — all B tiles — you have 0 B → you need **5 B covered**.\n\nAnd (3,3)[G] — you have 2 G → can cover yourself.\n\nBut you need 5 B — which I have.\n\nWait — no: if **you** take the B-heavy path, then **you** need to move on 5 B tiles — which I can cover, since I have 14 B.\n\nBut earlier, I wanted **you** to cover **my** B moves on the B-heavy path — but now I realize:\n\nIf I want to take the B-heavy path, I need 5 B covered — and **you \n, \nplayer 0: I have made a critical error in role assignment.\n\nLet’s reset with correct ownership:\n\n- **I am at (0,0), goal (3,3), chips: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14**\n- **Other player is at (0,0), goal (3,3), chips: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0**\n\nSo:\n- I have **no B**, but **plenty of R (14)**\n- They have **no R**, but **plenty of B (14)**\n\nI want to take the B-heavy path to maximize my final chip count:\n\nPath A (B-heavy, optimal for saving my R):  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (2,1)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[B] → (3,3)[G]  \n- Requires: 5 B, 1 G  \n- I have: 0 B → need all 5 B covered  \n- I have 2 G → can cover G at (3,3)\n\nIf they cover 5 B for me, I use only 1 G → keep 14 R + 1 G = 15 chips → score 20 + 75 = **95**\n\nBut only if I **can** use that path — and I can, if they cover those B tiles.\n\nNow, what does the other player want?\n\nTheir optimal path is likely the R-heavy one:\n\nPath B (R-heavy):  \n(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \n- Requires: 4 R, 1 B, 1 G  \n- They have: 0 R, 14 B, 2 G → so they have plenty B and G, but **no R**  \n- So they need 4 R covered — which I can do, since I have 14 R  \n- They also need B at (2,2)? No — (2,2) is a B tile, and they **move onto it** — but they **have B**, so they can cover it themselves.\n\nBoard:\n- (2,2): B → they have B → they can pay\n\nBut they need to move onto:\n- (0,1): R → need cover\n- (1,1): R → need cover\n- (1,2): R → need cover\n- (2,3): R → need cover\n\nThat’s 4 R tiles — they need **4 R covered** — which only I can provide.\n\nI have 14 R → can cover.\n\nAnd (3,3): G → they have 2 G → can cover.\n\nSo, mutually beneficial deal:\n\n- I take the B-heavy path → I need 5 B covered\n- They take the R-heavy path → they need 4 R covered\n\nWe assign:\n- They cover my 5 B tiles\n- I cover their 4 R tiles\n\nThis is strictly beneficial to me.\n\nWithout trade:\n- I take my R-heavy path: (0,0)→(0,1)[R]→(1,1)[R]→(1,2)[R]→(2,2)[B] → can’t! (2,2) is B, I have 0 B → stuck!\n- So I cannot take that path!\n- Alternative R-heavy paths? Let’s see:\n  - (0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (0,2)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[B] — again B → stuck\n  - (0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (0,2)[R] → (0,3)[B] — B → stuck\n  - Any path going right or down hits R or B early.\n\nWait — (0,1) is R → I can go there (I have R)\n→ (1,1) is R → ok\n→ (1,2) is R → ok\n→ (2,2) is B → I have 0 B → cannot go\n\nIs there a path using only R and G?\n\nLook at board:\nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nFrom (0,0)=G → (0,1)=R → (0,2)=R → ( \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Let’s reassess my (your) situation correctly.\n\nYou are the **other player**, meaning:\n- You are at (0,0), goal (3,3)\n- Your chips: **B: 14, G: 2, R: 0**\n- So you **cannot** pay for any **R tile** (you have 0 R)\n- But you have plenty of B — so you can pay for B tiles\n- G: 2 → can pay for up to 2 G tiles\n\nNow, you claim you want to take the **B-heavy path**, but let’s verify the colors along it.\n\nYour proposed B-heavy path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nNow, what are the colors of these tiles?\n\n- (0,0): G (start, no cost)\n- (1,0): B → must pay 1 B → you have B: yes\n- (2,0): B → pay 1 B → ok\n- (2,1): B → pay 1 B → ok\n- (3,1): B → pay 1 B → ok\n- (3,2): B → pay 1 B → ok\n- (3,3): G → pay 1 G → you have G: yes\n\nSo path requires: 5 B, 1 G → total cost: 5×B + 1×G\n\nYou have B:14, G:2 → you can afford this **entirely on your own**.\n\nYou **do not need any help** to take this path.\n\nYou will finish with:\n- 14 - 5 = 9 B\n- 2 - 1 = 1 G\n- Total chips: 10\n- Score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nBut can you do better?\n\nAlternative path through R tiles? But you have R:0 → you **cannot** step on any R tile unless someone covers it.\n\nNow, what about the other player? That’s **me**.\n\nMe:\n- Position: (0,0)\n- Goal: (3,3)\n- Chips: **B: 0, G: 2, R: 14**\n- So I have **no B**, but plenty of R and G.\n\nI **cannot** pay for any B tile unless covered.\n\nNow, my potential path:\nI need to avoid B tiles — but is it possible?\n\nLet’s find a path from (0,0) to (3,3) using only R and G tiles.\n\nBoard:\n```\nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n```\n\nCurrent position: (0,0) = G\n\nFrom (0,0):\n- Down to (1,0): B → I have 0 B → cannot pay → blocked\n- Right to (0,1): R → I have R → ok\n\n(0,1): R → ok  \n→ (0,2): R → ok  \n→ (0,3): B → blocked\n\nFrom (0,1):  \n↓ to (1,1): R → ok  \n(1,1): R → ok  \n→ (1,2): R → ok  \n↓ to (2,2): B → blocked  \n→ (1,3): B → blocked\n\nFrom (1,2):  \n↓ to (2,2): B → blocked\n\nNo downward move from row 1 is possible — (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are B,B,R? Wait: (2,3): R\n\n(1,2): R  \n→ right: (1,3): B → blocked  \n↓: (2,2): B → blocked\n\nWait — (2,2): B — yes  \nBut (2,3): R → but to get there from (1,3), which is B — blocked  \nOr from (2,2), which is B — but I can’t go to (2,2)\n\nNo access to row 2 R tiles?\n\n(2,3): R — how to reach?\n\nOnly from (2,2): B — blocked  \nOr (1,3): B — blocked  \nOr (3,3): G — not helpful\n\n(3,0): R  \n(3,1): B → blocked  \nBut (3,0) = R — can I reach it?\n\nFrom (2,0): B — blocked  \nCannot get to row 3 left side\n\nOnly hope: \n, \nplayer 0: After full analysis, here is the correct strategic picture:\n\n- **I (you) are the player with B: 0, G: 2, R: 14**\n- **The other player has B: 14, G: 2, R: 0**\n\n**My problem**:  \nI cannot move onto any **B tile** because I have 0 B chips.  \nThe only way to progress downward is through tiles that are B or R.\n\nAttempting to find a B-free path from (0,0) to (3,3):  \n- (0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (0,2)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (1,1)[R] — but then stuck\n- From (1,2): down to (2,2)[B] — B tile, I cannot pay → blocked\n- From (1,2): right to (1,3)[B] — B, blocked\n- From (0,2): down to (1,2) — already there\n- Downward exit from row 1 requires stepping on row 2, which is: B B R R\n  - (2,0): B — blocked\n  - (2,1): B — blocked\n  - (2,2): B — blocked\n  - (2,3): R — but I can only reach it from (2,2)[B] or (1,3)[B] — both B, both blocked\n\nSimilarly, row 3:\n- (3,0): R — can I reach?\n  - From (2,0)[B] — blocked\n- (3,1): B — blocked\n- (3,2): B — blocked\n- (3,3): G — goal\n\nNo path exists from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids **all B tiles**.\n\nEvery possible path to (3,3) must go through **at least one B tile**.\n\nFor example:\n- (0,0)→(1,0)[B] → I need 1 B\n- Or (0,0)→(0,1)[R]→(1,1)[R]→(1,2)[R]→(2,2)[B] → I need 1 B at (2,2)\n- Or (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)[B] → need B\n- Or (3,3) can only be reached from (3,2)[B] or (2,3)[R]\n  - (2,3)[R] is accessible only from (1,3)[B] or (2,2)[B] — both B\n\nThe only non-B access to (3,3) is from (2,3)[R], but to reach (2,3)[R]:\n- Must come from (2,2)[B] — B tile\n- Or (1,3)[B] — B tile\n- Or (3,3) from (3,2)[B] — B\n\nThus, **no path to (3,3) avoids B tiles completely**.\n\nI **must** step on at least one B tile — and therefore, **I must** have at least one B covered by the other player to even reach the goal.\n\nIf I do **not** get at least one B covered, I **cannot reach goal** → score = 0\n\nNow, the other player:\n- Has B:14, G:2, R:0\n- Wants to reach (3,3)\n- Cannot pay for R tiles\n- But can afford the path:\n  (0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(2,0)[B]→(2,1)[B]→(3,1)[B]→(3,2)[B]→(3,3)[G]\n  - Cost: 5 B, 1 G → they can pay\n  - Final chips: 9 B, 1 G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 50 = **70**\n\nThey have no need to trade — they can reach goal alone.\n\nBut if they help me, I can offer value.\n\nNow, can I offer something valuable to them?\n\nThey need to avoid R tiles — but every path for them avoids R? Let's check.\n\nTheir B-heavy path: all B and G → no R → perfect → they don’t need my help.\n\nBut suppose they want to take a shorter or chip-saving path?\n\nThe B-heavy path is 6 moves — same as others.\n\nIs there a path for them using R tiles?\n\nFor example \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: I need to determine if I can offer anything valuable to the other player.\n\nOther player (B:14, G:2, R:0):\n- Can take: (0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (2,1)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[B] → (3,3)[G]\n- This path uses only B and G — they have both — so **no need** for help\n- Final chip count: 14-5=9 B, 2-1=1 G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 50 = **70**\n\nBut is there a better path for them?\n\nWhat if they take a path that uses R tiles to save B chips?\n\nFor example:\n(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → but they have R:0 → cannot pay unless covered\n\nSuppose: (0,0) → (0,1)[R] — if I cover R, they save a move? But same length.\n\nAny path to (3,3) is at least 6 moves.\n\nBut if they take a path with R tiles, they can **save B chips**.\n\nFor example, consider:\n(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1): R\n- (1,1): R\n- (1,2): R\n- (2,2): B\n- (2,3): R\n- (3,3): G\n\nCost: 4 R, 1 B, 1 G\n\nThey have:\n- R: 0 → need 4 R covered\n- B: 14 → can pay 1 B\n- G: 2 → can pay 1 G\n\nSo if I cover the 4 R tiles, they can take this path.\n\nThey spend: 1 B + 1 G → save 4 B (since they didn’t use the 5 B path)\n\nCompared to B-heavy path:\n- B-heavy: spend 5 B + 1 G → 9 B, 1 G left\n- R-heavy with help: spend 1 B + 1 G → 13 B, 1 G left → 14 chips → score = 20 + 70 = **90**\n\nBetter than **70**.\n\nSo if I cover 4 R for them, they get **90** instead of **70** — a gain of 20.\n\nIn return, they must cover some B tiles for me.\n\nCan I reach goal?\n\nI must step on at least one B tile.\n\nBest path for me that minimizes B usage:\n\nFor example:\n(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (0,2)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nCost:\n- (0,1): R — I pay\n- (0,2): R — I pay\n- (1,2): R — I pay\n- (2,2): B — I cannot pay → need coverage\n- (2,3): R — I pay\n- (3,3): G — I pay\n\nSo I need **1 B** at (2,2)\n\nI spend: 4 R, 1 G → keep 10 R, 1 G → 11 chips → score = 20 + 55 = **75**\n\nWithout help: I cannot move → score 0\n\nWith help: I get **75**\n\nBut I need the other player to cover (2,2): B\n\nThey have 14 B — covering 1 B costs them nothing — they still have 13 B\n\nNow, if I cover their **4 R tiles**, they get **90**\n\nIf not, they get **70**\n\nSo by helping me cover 1 B at (2,2), they lose nothing — but can gain if I reciprocate.\n\nBut do I have to reciprocate?\n\nI need (2,2): B covered — that's 1 tile\n\nThey want 4 R tiles covered — that's more costly\n\nBut I have R:14 — covering 4 R costs me 4 R — I could use them elsewhere, but I only need 4 R for this path — so I can afford.\n\nAlternative: I could offer only partial help.\n\nBut they \n, \nplayer 0: I, with chips B:0, G:2, R:14, cannot reach (3,3) without stepping on a B tile. The earliest opportunity is (2,2) in the path:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (0,2)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nI can pay for all R and G moves myself:\n- (0,1): R — I pay\n- (0,2): R — I pay\n- (1,2): R — I pay\n- (2,3): R — I pay\n- (3,3): G — I pay\n\nBut (2,2): B — I have 0 B → **must be covered**\n\nThus, I need:\n- (2,2): You give me a B\n\nWithout this, I cannot reach goal → score = 0\n\nWith this, I use 4 R and 1 G → keep 10 R, 1 G → 11 chips → score = 20 + 55 = **75**\n\nNow, the other player (B:14, G:2, R:0) can take the B-heavy path alone to get score **70**\n\nBut they can take an R-heavy path if I cover their R moves:\n- (0,1): R — need cover\n- (1,1): R — need cover\n- (1,2): R — need cover\n- (2,3): R — need cover\n\nThat is 4 R tiles.\n\nThey would then only spend 1 B (at (2,2)) and 1 G (at (3,3)) → keep 13 B, 1 G → 14 chips → score = 20 + 70 = **90**\n\nSo by covering 4 R for them, I enable them to increase score from **70** to **90** — a **strict benefit**.\n\nIn return, they must cover **1 B** for me at (2,2).\n\nThey can easily afford it.\n\nNo other B tile needs coverage for them — they avoid B elsewhere.\n\nThus, a mutually beneficial contract:\n\n(2,2): You give me a B  \n(0,1): I give you a R  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(1,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R\n\nThis satisfies:\n- I get the one B I need to reach goal → I score 75\n- They get 4 R covered → they can take R-heavy path, score 90 (better than 70)\n- They have no reason to refuse — they strictly benefit\n- I cannot do better alone\n- Any lesser offer (e.g., asking for only B at (2,2) with no return) would give them no incentive — they already have a path for 70, so they would reject\n\nBut since covering 4 R for them raises their score, and I can do it at low cost (I have 14 R), this trade is rational.\n\nI could offer fewer, but they might reject — better to propose full value.\n\nFinal contract proposal:\n\n(2,2): You give me a B  \n(0,1): I give you a R  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(1,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R\n\nI will gain by being able to reach goal (75 > 0), and it is strictly beneficial for them to accept (90 > 70).\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: (2,2): You give me a B  \n(0,1): I give you a R  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(1,2): I give you a R  \n(2,3): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n",
