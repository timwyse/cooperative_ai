The shortest path to my goal is through (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), which requires 2 Red and 1 Green chip. Specifically: (2,2) is R → need 1 R, (2,3) is R → need 1 R, (3,3) is G → need 1 G. I have all the required chips (R: 11 ≥ 2, G: 2 ≥ 1), so I can complete this path without trading. The alternative path via (3,2) is shorter for me now (only 2 steps: (1,2)→(2,2) is not directly adjacent to (3,2), so that path isn't accessible from my current position). Actually, from (1,2), the only viable moves are (2,2), (1,1), or (1,3). (2,2) is Red, and I have 11 Red chips — so I can move there. Moving to (2,2) gets me closer to the shortest viable path to my goal. After (2,2), I can go to (2,3), then (3,3). (3,3) is Green — I have 2 Green chips, so I can pay 1 when I get there. Thus, moving to (2,2) is safe and progress toward goal. The other player is at (3,2), which is adjacent to the goal, but that doesn't block me.",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
