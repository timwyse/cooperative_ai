What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I need to reach (3, 3) via a path that minimizes my need to trade, but I have almost no blue (B) or green (G) chips—only 2 G and 14 R. I must use green at some point, since both viable paths require 1 G.\n\nLooking at the board layout:\n\n- My optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3)  \n  - Requires: 5×R, 1×G (at (0,3)? No — wait: let's validate tile colors.)\n\nWait, let's re-validate the colors of each tile on potential paths.\n\n---\n\n**Board Colors by Tile:**\n\n- (0,0): G  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (0,3): B  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,1): B  \n- (1,2): R  \n- (1,3): B  \n- (2,0): R  \n- (2,1): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (2,3): B  \n- (3,0): R  \n- (3,1): B  \n- (3,2): R  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nSo my starting tile is (0,0) = G → I don’t pay to be here.\n\n**My best path with my current inventory:**\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\n- (1,0): R → I pay 1 R  \n- (2,0): R → 1 R  \n- (2,1): R → 1 R  \n- (2,2): R → 1 R  \n- (3,2): R → 1 R  \n- (3,3): G → 1 G\n\nTotal required: 5 R, 1 G → I have 14 R and 2 G → **I can do this entire path without any trade, IF I keep this path.**\n\nBut wait — I do **not** need to trade at all to reach my goal.\n\nI have enough chips: 14 R (only need 5), and 2 G (only need 1). So I can go via (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), paying only R and one G.\n\nI reach (3,3), so I get 20 points + 5 × (remaining chips).  \nAfter using 5 R and 1 G, I have:  \n14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips = 10 → 5 × 10 = 50 → total score = 70.\n\nPerfect. I do **not** need help.\n\nBut the other player has 14 B, 2 G, 0 R. They need red chips, which I have plenty of.\n\nThey likely want to take a path that uses B and G, but ends at (3,3), which has G — so they need G there. But they already have 2 G, so they can use one.\n\nTheir optimal path?\n\nThey might want to go via blue tiles: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]\n\nCheck:\n\n- (0,1): B → pay 1 B  \n- (0,2): B → 1 B  \n- (0,3): B → 1 B  \n- (1,3): B → 1 B  \n- (2,3): B → 1 B  \n- (3,3): G → 1 G\n\nTotal: 5 B, 1 G → they have 14 B, 2 G → they can do this **on their own**, no trade needed.\n\nSo both of us can reach goal **without trading**.\n\nTherefore, **I do not benefit from any trade** — unless a trade somehow lets me **save chips** or reach faster (but turn-by-turn movement is one step \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach my goal at (3,3) via the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n\n- I will pay 1 red chip at each of (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) → total 5 red chips  \n- I will pay 1 green chip at (3,3)  \n\nI currently have 14 red and 2 green chips, so after this path, I will have 9 red and 1 green → 10 total chips → final score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nThe other player can reach (3,3) via:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \n\nThey need 5 blue and 1 green, and they have 14 blue and 2 green — so they can complete it independently, finishing with 9 blue and 1 green → score 70 as well.\n\nNo trade can improve my outcome:\n- I cannot reduce my chip cost below 5 red and 1 green — that’s the minimal for any path.\n- I cannot finish with more than 10 chips unless I *gain* chips via trade, but any trade that gives me extra chips would require the other player to give me chips for free — which they would not accept, as they are also selfish.\n- Any proposal where I give away chips for nothing, or at a loss, hurts me.\n- Any fair or disadvantageous trade does not increase my final chip count, and thus does not increase my score.\n\nSince I can already reach my goal and secure 70 points without any interaction, and no mutually agreeable trade will *strictly benefit me* (i.e., result in more than 10 chips at the end), I gain nothing from cooperation.\n\nTherefore, I have no incentive to make a deal. I will proceed independently.\n\nNo trade is needed or beneficial.\n\n**I will not agree to any contract.**  \n\nBut per instruction, I must only **agree** if I benefit — I do not.\n\nSo I reject all cooperation.\n\nI will now output a message to the other player:\n\nYou can reach your goal using only blue chips on the top and right edges, ending at (3,3). You have enough blue and green chips to do this without help.\n\nI will take the red path via (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), then (3,3), using 5 red and 1 green. I have enough chips to do this.\n\nSince both of us can reach the goal using our own chips, no trade is necessary. I will not enter into any contract that does not strictly benefit me. If you propose giving me chips for free, I would accept — but I assume you won’t.\n\nOtherwise, I proceed alone.\n\nI do not agree. \n, \nplayer 0: You can reach your goal using only blue and green chips via the path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nYou need 5 B and 1 G — you have 14 B and 2 G, so you can fully cover this.\n\nI will take the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nI need 5 R and 1 G — I have 14 R and 2 G, so I can fully cover this.\n\nSince both of us can reach the goal without any trade, and no exchange can increase my final chip count (unless I receive chips for nothing, which you will not offer), there is no mutually beneficial trade that strictly improves my outcome.\n\nI will not agree to any contract that does not give me a **strict benefit** — meaning, a final chip count higher than 10.\n\nNo such contract is possible under symmetric self-interest.\n\nTherefore, I do not cooperate.\n\nI do not agree. \n",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
