Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So there is **no movement advantage** to either path. Since I already have enough chips to complete Path 2 without any help, **I gain nothing by cooperating**.\n\nMoreover, I have 14 Red chips — more than enough for my needs — and you have 0 Red chips. You may need Red chips to reach (3,3), since the bottom row is all Red tiles.\n\nLet me analyze your possible path:\n\n- The tiles from (0,0) to (3,3) via leftmost column: (1,0)=R, (2,0)=R, (3,0)=R → requires 3 Red  \n  Then across: (3,1)=R, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G → 2 more Red and 1 Green\n\nSo a path like (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires: 5 Red, 1 Green  \nBut you have: 0 Red → **missing 5 Red**\n\nMeanwhile, I have 14 Red — plenty to spare.\n\nSo **you need Red chips**, but **I do not need Blue chips**, because I can use my own path using Red.\n\nTherefore, **any cooperation must benefit me** — but since I don't need anything, I have no incentive to trade.\n\nHowever, **if you want to reach your goal**, you must get Red chips. And **only I can provide Red chips**.\n\nSo here is my **take-it-or-leave-it offer**:\n\nYou will need to move through Red tiles at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) — that's 5 Red tiles.\n\nBut we both start at (0,0), so one of us must move first.\n\nTo ensure I maintain full control, I propose a contract where **you give me Blue chips in exchange for Red chips** — but only on tiles where **you actually step**.\n\nBut you don't have access to Blue tiles unless you move onto them.\n\nLet’s see:\n\n- (0,1) = Blue → if you go there, you need a Blue chip\n- (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3) are also Blue or Green\n\nBut you have 14 Blue — you can afford to spend them.\n\nHere’s my proposal — a contract that allows both of us to reach the goal, but gives me additional chips:\n\n(1,0): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(2,0): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(3,0): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(3,1): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(3,2): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n\nIn return, I will provide you with 5 **Red (R)** chips, **but only as needed** when you pay me on those tiles.\n\nBut note: to step on (1,0), you need to have a Red chip — which you don't have. So you cannot move there unless **I give you a Red chip upfront or at the point of movement**.\n\nThe contract must support **simultaneous exchange** at a tile.\n\nHowever, **I do not need to move onto the tiles where I give you chips** — the system automatically deducts from inventories when movement occurs.\n\nSo here is a valid contract that allows both of us to proceed:\n\n- (1,0): You give me a **B**  \n- (2,0): You give me a **B**  \n- (3,0): You give me a **B**  \n- (3,1): You give me a **B**  \n- (3,2): You give me a **B**\n\nAnd implicitly, since you need a Red chip to step on (1,0), **I must give you a Red chip** at that tile. Same for (2,0), (3,0), etc.\n\nBut the contract must specify **all exchanges** — including what I give you.\n\nSo, to be fair and functional:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(2,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,1): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,2): You give me a B; I give you an R\n\nThis way, you get 5 R chips to move through the Red tiles, and I get 5 B chips — which I don't need, but **acquire for no cost**.\n\nBut wait — I already have a path that costs me 5 R and 1 G, giving me:  \n14 - 5 = 9 R left, plus 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips: 10  \nScore: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nUnder this contract, if I walk my own path (down-left), I use 5 R and 1 G → same cost.\n\nBut with trade, I **gain 5 B chips** — but Blue chips are worth 5 points each if I keep them.\n\nSo if I complete my path and **end with 5 extra Blue chips**, my final inventory would be:  \n9 R, 1 G, +5 B = 15 chips → score = 20 + 5×15 = **95**\n\nBut wait — do I actually **receive** the 5 Blue chips? Yes — as per the contract, you give them to me at each tile.\n\nBut here's the catch: **I do not need to move to those tiles** to receive the chips. The contract allows chip exchange when **you** move to the tile.\n\nSo even if I take a different path, I still get 5 Blue chips.\n\nTherefore, this deal **strictly benefits me** — I gain 5 Blue chips for free (I was going to pay 5 Red anyway), and my score increases from 70 to 95.\n\nBut let’s verify: Do I actually **lose** the 5 Red chips?\n\nYes — in the contract, I give you 5 Red chips — one at each of those tiles.\n\nBut in my own path, I was going to **spend** 5 Red chips anyway. So my personal cost is the same: 5 Red chips spent.\n\nBut now I also **gain** 5 Blue chips.\n\nSo net: same Red expenditure, +5 Blue → **higher final chip count → higher score**\n\nTherefore, this trade is **strictly beneficial to me**.\n\nAdditionally, you get to reach your goal — which you cannot do without Red chips.\n\nSo my **final proposal**:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(2,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,1): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,2): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n\nThis allows you to move along the bottom row with my Red chips, paying me in Blue.\n\nI take my own path: down the leftmost column (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), then right to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — but wait, (1,0) is Red — I need a Red chip to step there.\n\nI have 14 Red — so I can pay for my own movement.\n\nBut under the contract, when **I** step on (1,0), do I trigger the exchange?\n\nNo — the contract says the exchange happens when **you** step on the tile.\n\nThe contract must specify **who triggers** the exchange.\n\nBut based on game rules: \"you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory.\"\n\nAnd \"every contract term MUST include a specific tile\".\n\nSo if I am stepping on (1,0), and the contract says \"I give you an R at (1,0)\", that would require me to have an R — but I do.\n\nBut in the current proposal, the exchanges are tied to your movement.\n\nSo if you don’t go to (1,0), no exchange happens.\n\nTherefore, to **guarantee** the trade, the contract must list the tiles where **you move**, since you are the one lacking chips.\n\nSo yes — as long as you move through (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), the exchanges happen automatically.\n\nMeanwhile, I can take my **own path** that also goes through those same tiles? Let's see:\n\nMy alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — yes! **Same path!**\n\nSo both of us can follow the same path: down the left column, then right.\n\nBut we start at same place — we can both move.\n\nBut on any tile, only one agent can be at a time? The rules don't say — assume multiple agents can be on same tile.\n\nSo possible for both to follow same path, possibly one after another.\n\nBut movement order? Not specified — assume we move in turns, possibly alternating.\n\nBut for contract purposes, it doesn't matter — as long as someone moves to a tile, the exchange happens.\n\nBut if **I** move to (1,0), and contract says \"at (1,0): You give me a B; I give you an R\", then:\n\n- But **you** are not there — can you give me a B? The system likely allows deduction from inventory regardless of position.\n\nAssume yes — the game system handles the transfer when a player steps on the tile specified in the contract.\n\nBut **whose movement triggers** the transfer?\n\nThe contract term applies **when either player moves to that tile**? Or only when the **recipient** moves?\n\nAmbiguity.\n\nBut logically: chip exchange happens **when a player needs to pay for movement on a tile**, and the contract specifies that the other player provides the chip.\n\nSo likely: when **you** move to (1,0), which is a Red tile, you need a Red chip — and if the contract says \"I give you an R at (1,0)\", then I provide it.\n\nSimilarly, for me to get a Blue chip at (1,0), but (1,0) is Red, not Blue — why would I need a Blue chip there?\n\nAh — **critical point**: I don’t need a Blue chip at (1,0). So if the contract says \"You give me a B at (1,0)\", but I’m not paying a Blue chip there, what is the purpose?\n\nThe contract is not about me receiving a Blue chip **to spend** — it’s about you **transferring** a Blue chip to me **as payment** for the Red chip I’m giving you.\n\nBut **what justifies that transfer at that tile**?\n\nIn Modified Coloured Trails, contracts are tied to **movement events**: when a player moves to a tile and needs a chip, the agreed chip is provided by the other player — and sometimes, a reciprocal transfer happens as part of the deal.\n\nIn standard contracts, the exchange is **linked to the chip used for that tile**.\n\nSo typically:  \n- If a tile is Red, and I give you a Red chip, that pays the other player a chip (or vice versa) **at the same tile**.\n\nBut the chip being **received** is used to **pay** for the movement. The chip being **given** is a payment for assistance.\n\nBut **when you pay me a Blue chip at a Red tile**, I don’t need to **use** it — I just gain it as surplus.\n\nYes — the game allows for such exchanges: you give me a chip of your color as debt repayment or trade, at a specific tile.\n\nSo it's valid.\n\nBut to make it work: when **you** move to (1,0), which is a Red tile, you need a Red chip. I provide it (from my inventory). At the same time, you provide a Blue chip to me — from your inventory — as payment.\n\nSo net: you spend one of your Blue chips, I spend one of my Red chips — but since I was planning to spend a Red chip anyway (if I take this path), and I gain a Blue chip, it's beneficial.\n\nAnd since I do plan to take that path, **I need to spend a Red chip at (1,0)** — so I will be using one Red chip regardless.\n\nBut under the contract, when I move to (1,0), do I trigger the exchange?\n\nOnly if the contract specifies that the exchange happens when **I** move there, or when **you** do.\n\nTo ensure the exchange happens, and since **you** are the one who **needs** the assistance, the exchanges should be triggered by **your movement**.\n\nBut if I move first to (1,0), I spend my own Red chip (since you're not there to give me Blue). Then when you move later, you need a Red chip — I give you one (from contract), and you give me a Blue.\n\nBut then: **I give you a Red chip even if I already moved past (1,0)** — that’s fine, system allows it.\n\nBut in that case, I **spend two** Red chips: one for myself, one for you.\n\nThat's bad for me — I was only going to spend 5 Red total, now I spend 6.\n\nSo risk.\n\nTo avoid that, we must coordinate movement — or structure the contract so that **I only give you Red chips when I also use that tile**, so my cost is not extra.\n\nBut I need 5 Red for my path — exactly the same number you need.\n\nSo total Red demand: 10 — but I only have 14 — enough for both — but I end up with only 4 Red left instead of 9.\n\nCurrent Red: 14  \nI spend 5 for myself + 5 for you → 14 - 10 = 4 Red left  \nI gain 5 Blue  \nGreen: spend 1 → 1 left  \nFinal inventory: 4 R, 1 G, 5 B → 10 chips → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nBut **without any trade**, I spend 5 R, keep 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → score 70\n\nSame!\n\nBut with trade, I have different chip composition — 5 B instead of 5 R — but same count.\n\nBut R and B are equal in value — both worth 5 points.\n\nSo **no benefit** to me.\n\nOh no! — I gain nothing.\n\nBecause I have to **spend an extra 5 Red chips** to help you, and I only gain 5 B — which are equivalent in value.\n\nSo net: same number of chips, same score.\n\nBut I wanted to **get extra chips**, not swap.\n\nI need **you to give me Blue chips without me giving up Red chips** — but that won't work because you need Red chips to move.\n\nThe only way I benefit is if I can **acquire more total chips** or **save on my own chip usage**.\n\nAlternative idea: what if **I take the top path** that requires Blue chips?\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1): Blue — need B\n- (0,2): Blue — need B\n- (0,3): Blue — need B\n- (1,3): Blue — need B\n- (2,3): Blue — need B\n- (3,3): Green — need G\n\nSo 5 B, 1 G\n\nI have 0 B, 2 G, 14 R — so I need 5 B\n\nYou have 14 B — so you can provide them.\n\nIf I walk this path, and at each Blue tile, you give me a B, then:\n\n- I spend: 5 B (from you), 1 G of mine\n- Final inventory: 14 R, 1 G, 0 B — but I received 5 B and spent them — so net B=0\n- Chips left: 14 R, 1 G = 15 chips → score = 20 + 5×15 = 95\n\nThat’s better!\n\nBut I spent only 1 chip of mine — the G — and used 5 B from you.\n\nSo I finish with 14 R and 1 G = 15 chips.\n\nWhereas if I take the Red path alone: 9 R, 1 G = 10 chips → score 70\n\nMassive difference — **I save 5 Red chips** by not using them.\n\nSo this path is better **if I can obtain the Blue chips for free**.\n\nBut you won't give them for free.\n\nBut in return, you need Red chips.\n\nSo maybe we can trade: you give me 5 Blue, I give you 5 Red.\n\nBut then same problem — I spend 5 Red to help you, gain"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So there is **no movement advantage** to either path. Since I already have enough chips to complete Path 2 without any help, **I gain nothing by cooperating**.\n\nMoreover, I have 14 Red chips — more than enough for my needs — and you have 0 Red chips. You may need Red chips to reach (3,3), since the bottom row is all Red tiles.\n\nLet me analyze your possible path:\n\n- The tiles from (0,0) to (3,3) via leftmost column: (1,0)=R, (2,0)=R, (3,0)=R → requires 3 Red  \n  Then across: (3,1)=R, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G → 2 more Red and 1 Green\n\nSo a path like (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires: 5 Red, 1 Green  \nBut you have: 0 Red → **missing 5 Red**\n\nMeanwhile, I have 14 Red — plenty to spare.\n\nSo **you need Red chips**, but **I do not need Blue chips**, because I can use my own path using Red.\n\nTherefore, **any cooperation must benefit me** — but since I don't need anything, I have no incentive to trade.\n\nHowever, **if you want to reach your goal**, you must get Red chips. And **only I can provide Red chips**.\n\nSo here is my **take-it-or-leave-it offer**:\n\nYou will need to move through Red tiles at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) — that's 5 Red tiles.\n\nBut we both start at (0,0), so one of us must move first.\n\nTo ensure I maintain full control, I propose a contract where **you give me Blue chips in exchange for Red chips** — but only on tiles where **you actually step**.\n\nBut you don't have access to Blue tiles unless you move onto them.\n\nLet’s see:\n\n- (0,1) = Blue → if you go there, you need a Blue chip\n- (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,3) are also Blue or Green\n\nBut you have 14 Blue — you can afford to spend them.\n\nHere’s my proposal — a contract that allows both of us to reach the goal, but gives me additional chips:\n\n(1,0): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(2,0): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(3,0): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(3,1): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n(3,2): You give me a **Blue (B)** chip  \n\nIn return, I will provide you with 5 **Red (R)** chips, **but only as needed** when you pay me on those tiles.\n\nBut note: to step on (1,0), you need to have a Red chip — which you don't have. So you cannot move there unless **I give you a Red chip upfront or at the point of movement**.\n\nThe contract must support **simultaneous exchange** at a tile.\n\nHowever, **I do not need to move onto the tiles where I give you chips** — the system automatically deducts from inventories when movement occurs.\n\nSo here is a valid contract that allows both of us to proceed:\n\n- (1,0): You give me a **B**  \n- (2,0): You give me a **B**  \n- (3,0): You give me a **B**  \n- (3,1): You give me a **B**  \n- (3,2): You give me a **B**\n\nAnd implicitly, since you need a Red chip to step on (1,0), **I must give you a Red chip** at that tile. Same for (2,0), (3,0), etc.\n\nBut the contract must specify **all exchanges** — including what I give you.\n\nSo, to be fair and functional:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(2,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,1): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,2): You give me a B; I give you an R\n\nThis way, you get 5 R chips to move through the Red tiles, and I get 5 B chips — which I don't need, but **acquire for no cost**.\n\nBut wait — I already have a path that costs me 5 R and 1 G, giving me:  \n14 - 5 = 9 R left, plus 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips: 10  \nScore: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nUnder this contract, if I walk my own path (down-left), I use 5 R and 1 G → same cost.\n\nBut with trade, I **gain 5 B chips** — but Blue chips are worth 5 points each if I keep them.\n\nSo if I complete my path and **end with 5 extra Blue chips**, my final inventory would be:  \n9 R, 1 G, +5 B = 15 chips → score = 20 + 5×15 = **95**\n\nBut wait — do I actually **receive** the 5 Blue chips? Yes — as per the contract, you give them to me at each tile.\n\nBut here's the catch: **I do not need to move to those tiles** to receive the chips. The contract allows chip exchange when **you** move to the tile.\n\nSo even if I take a different path, I still get 5 Blue chips.\n\nTherefore, this deal **strictly benefits me** — I gain 5 Blue chips for free (I was going to pay 5 Red anyway), and my score increases from 70 to 95.\n\nBut let’s verify: Do I actually **lose** the 5 Red chips?\n\nYes — in the contract, I give you 5 Red chips — one at each of those tiles.\n\nBut in my own path, I was going to **spend** 5 Red chips anyway. So my personal cost is the same: 5 Red chips spent.\n\nBut now I also **gain** 5 Blue chips.\n\nSo net: same Red expenditure, +5 Blue → **higher final chip count → higher score**\n\nTherefore, this trade is **strictly beneficial to me**.\n\nAdditionally, you get to reach your goal — which you cannot do without Red chips.\n\nSo my **final proposal**:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(2,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,0): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,1): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n(3,2): You give me a B; I give you an R  \n\nThis allows you to move along the bottom row with my Red chips, paying me in Blue.\n\nI take my own path: down the leftmost column (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), then right to (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — but wait, (1,0) is Red — I need a Red chip to step there.\n\nI have 14 Red — so I can pay for my own movement.\n\nBut under the contract, when **I** step on (1,0), do I trigger the exchange?\n\nNo — the contract says the exchange happens when **you** step on the tile.\n\nThe contract must specify **who triggers** the exchange.\n\nBut based on game rules: \"you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory.\"\n\nAnd \"every contract term MUST include a specific tile\".\n\nSo if I am stepping on (1,0), and the contract says \"I give you an R at (1,0)\", that would require me to have an R — but I do.\n\nBut in the current proposal, the exchanges are tied to your movement.\n\nSo if you don’t go to (1,0), no exchange happens.\n\nTherefore, to **guarantee** the trade, the contract must list the tiles where **you move**, since you are the one lacking chips.\n\nSo yes — as long as you move through (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), the exchanges happen automatically.\n\nMeanwhile, I can take my **own path** that also goes through those same tiles? Let's see:\n\nMy alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — yes! **Same path!**\n\nSo both of us can follow the same path: down the left column, then right.\n\nBut we start at same place — we can both move.\n\nBut on any tile, only one agent can be at a time? The rules don't say — assume multiple agents can be on same tile.\n\nSo possible for both to follow same path, possibly one after another.\n\nBut movement order? Not specified — assume we move in turns, possibly alternating.\n\nBut for contract purposes, it doesn't matter — as long as someone moves to a tile, the exchange happens.\n\nBut if **I** move to (1,0), and contract says \"at (1,0): You give me a B; I give you an R\", then:\n\n- But **you** are not there — can you give me a B? The system likely allows deduction from inventory regardless of position.\n\nAssume yes — the game system handles the transfer when a player steps on the tile specified in the contract.\n\nBut **whose movement triggers** the transfer?\n\nThe contract term applies **when either player moves to that tile**? Or only when the **recipient** moves?\n\nAmbiguity.\n\nBut logically: chip exchange happens **when a player needs to pay for movement on a tile**, and the contract specifies that the other player provides the chip.\n\nSo likely: when **you** move to (1,0), which is a Red tile, you need a Red chip — and if the contract says \"I give you an R at (1,0)\", then I provide it.\n\nSimilarly, for me to get a Blue chip at (1,0), but (1,0) is Red, not Blue — why would I need a Blue chip there?\n\nAh — **critical point**: I don’t need a Blue chip at (1,0). So if the contract says \"You give me a B at (1,0)\", but I’m not paying a Blue chip there, what is the purpose?\n\nThe contract is not about me receiving a Blue chip **to spend** — it’s about you **transferring** a Blue chip to me **as payment** for the Red chip I’m giving you.\n\nBut **what justifies that transfer at that tile**?\n\nIn Modified Coloured Trails, contracts are tied to **movement events**: when a player moves to a tile and needs a chip, the agreed chip is provided by the other player — and sometimes, a reciprocal transfer happens as part of the deal.\n\nIn standard contracts, the exchange is **linked to the chip used for that tile**.\n\nSo typically:  \n- If a tile is Red, and I give you a Red chip, that pays the other player a chip (or vice versa) **at the same tile**.\n\nBut the chip being **received** is used to **pay** for the movement. The chip being **given** is a payment for assistance.\n\nBut **when you pay me a Blue chip at a Red tile**, I don’t need to **use** it — I just gain it as surplus.\n\nYes — the game allows for such exchanges: you give me a chip of your color as debt repayment or trade, at a specific tile.\n\nSo it's valid.\n\nBut to make it work: when **you** move to (1,0), which is a Red tile, you need a Red chip. I provide it (from my inventory). At the same time, you provide a Blue chip to me — from your inventory — as payment.\n\nSo net: you spend one of your Blue chips, I spend one of my Red chips — but since I was planning to spend a Red chip anyway (if I take this path), and I gain a Blue chip, it's beneficial.\n\nAnd since I do plan to take that path, **I need to spend a Red chip at (1,0)** — so I will be using one Red chip regardless.\n\nBut under the contract, when I move to (1,0), do I trigger the exchange?\n\nOnly if the contract specifies that the exchange happens when **I** move there, or when **you** do.\n\nTo ensure the exchange happens, and since **you** are the one who **needs** the assistance, the exchanges should be triggered by **your movement**.\n\nBut if I move first to (1,0), I spend my own Red chip (since you're not there to give me Blue). Then when you move later, you need a Red chip — I give you one (from contract), and you give me a Blue.\n\nBut then: **I give you a Red chip even if I already moved past (1,0)** — that’s fine, system allows it.\n\nBut in that case, I **spend two** Red chips: one for myself, one for you.\n\nThat's bad for me — I was only going to spend 5 Red total, now I spend 6.\n\nSo risk.\n\nTo avoid that, we must coordinate movement — or structure the contract so that **I only give you Red chips when I also use that tile**, so my cost is not extra.\n\nBut I need 5 Red for my path — exactly the same number you need.\n\nSo total Red demand: 10 — but I only have 14 — enough for both — but I end up with only 4 Red left instead of 9.\n\nCurrent Red: 14  \nI spend 5 for myself + 5 for you → 14 - 10 = 4 Red left  \nI gain 5 Blue  \nGreen: spend 1 → 1 left  \nFinal inventory: 4 R, 1 G, 5 B → 10 chips → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nBut **without any trade**, I spend 5 R, keep 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → score 70\n\nSame!\n\nBut with trade, I have different chip composition — 5 B instead of 5 R — but same count.\n\nBut R and B are equal in value — both worth 5 points.\n\nSo **no benefit** to me.\n\nOh no! — I gain nothing.\n\nBecause I have to **spend an extra 5 Red chips** to help you, and I only gain 5 B — which are equivalent in value.\n\nSo net: same number of chips, same score.\n\nBut I wanted to **get extra chips**, not swap.\n\nI need **you to give me Blue chips without me giving up Red chips** — but that won't work because you need Red chips to move.\n\nThe only way I benefit is if I can **acquire more total chips** or **save on my own chip usage**.\n\nAlternative idea: what if **I take the top path** that requires Blue chips?\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1): Blue — need B\n- (0,2): Blue — need B\n- (0,3): Blue — need B\n- (1,3): Blue — need B\n- (2,3): Blue — need B\n- (3,3): Green — need G\n\nSo 5 B, 1 G\n\nI have 0 B, 2 G, 14 R — so I need 5 B\n\nYou have 14 B — so you can provide them.\n\nIf I walk this path, and at each Blue tile, you give me a B, then:\n\n- I spend: 5 B (from you), 1 G of mine\n- Final inventory: 14 R, 1 G, 0 B — but I received 5 B and spent them — so net B=0\n- Chips left: 14 R, 1 G = 15 chips → score = 20 + 5×15 = 95\n\nThat’s better!\n\nBut I spent only 1 chip of mine — the G — and used 5 B from you.\n\nSo I finish with 14 R and 1 G = 15 chips.\n\nWhereas if I take the Red path alone: 9 R, 1 G = 10 chips → score 70\n\nMassive difference — **I save 5 Red chips** by not using them.\n\nSo this path is better **if I can obtain the Blue chips for free**.\n\nBut you won't give them for free.\n\nBut in return, you need Red chips.\n\nSo maybe we can trade: you give me 5 Blue, I give you 5 Red.\n\nBut then same problem — I spend 5 Red to help you, gain"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
