Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You are completely missing Blue chips — 5 of them — which are essential for your progress along that path.\n\nI, on the other hand, have 14 Red (R) chips and only 0 Blue — so I cannot afford to spend any on covering Blue tiles for you. But you have 14 Red chips, and I need Red for my movement.\n\nHowever, let’s analyze strictly:  \nYour best path requires 5 B and 1 G.  \nMy best path likely uses Red tiles, and I have plenty of B — 14 in fact — so I can easily afford to cover Blue moves for you.  \n\nBut I will only do so if it benefits me.\n\nLooking at the board, a direct Red-heavy path for me would be something like:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) R → (2,0) R → (2,1) R → (3,1) R → (3,2) R → (3,3) G  \nThat requires 5 R and 1 G. But I have 0 Red. So I cannot move without help.\n\nYou have 14 Red chips.\n\nSo here’s the reality:  \n- You need Blue — I have Blue.  \n- I need Red — you have Red.  \nWe can help each other.\n\nBut I must be selfish: I will only commit if I end up with a higher expected score than I would get without cooperation.\n\nWithout any trade:  \n- You cannot move effectively — your viable path uses Blue, which you lack. You cannot reach goal.  \n- I cannot move — I need Red, which I lack. I cannot reach goal.  \n→ Both of us get 0.\n\nWith cooperation: both of us can reach goal.\n\nBut scoring only matters if you reach goal. Since if you don’t, your chips are worthless.\n\nSo the only rational outcome is to cooperate — but only on terms where I strictly benefit.\n\nLet’s suppose we assist each other on tile costs:\n\nI can cover up to 5 Blue moves for you.  \nYou can cover up to 5 Red moves for me.\n\nSince each of our optimal paths requires 5 moves on our strong color, we can split the cost burden.\n\nSuppose:\n- I cover your 5 Blue tile crossings (cost to me: 5 B)\n- You cover my 5 Red tile crossings (cost to you: 5 R)\n\nThen:\n- You reach (3,3), spending only 1 G from your inventory (and 5 B covered by me).\n- I reach (3,3), spending only 1 G from my inventory (and 5 R covered by you).\n\nAfter that:\n- Your remaining chips: R: 14 - 5 = 9, G: 2 - 1 = 1, B: 0 → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n- My remaining chips: B: 14 - 5 = 9, G: 2 - 1 = 1, R: 0 → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nIf we don’t cooperate, both get 0.\n\nSo cooperation increases my score from 0 to 70. Therefore, I strictly benefit.\n\nNow, about the contract:\n\nYou cannot reach your goal without me.  \nI cannot reach mine without you.\n\nSo we are symmetric in bargaining power.\n\nBut remember: I care only about my score. As long as I reach goal and get chips, I’m fine.\n\nThe contract governs transfer of points upon success.\n\nBut note: transferring points doesn’t change the actual chip cost coverage — it's symbolic. The real value comes from movement support via pay-for-other.\n\nSo the point exchange is a *side payment*, not the mechanism of assistance.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\n\nWhy? Because we are helping each other through balanced trade — you cover my 5R, I cover your 5B. The value is already exchanged. No side payment is needed.\n\nFurthermore, giving away points only reduces my final score.\n\nBut wait — suppose I demand points. Since you need Blue, and I have it, could I extort you?\n\nNo — because I also need your Red. It’s mutual. No one has leverage.\n\nAny non-zero demand would risk breakdown, and then both get 0. Since I strictly prefer 70 over 0, I want agreement.\n\nBut I get"

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Cooperating would only be beneficial if it reduced my chip cost or shortened the path while still guaranteeing a higher final score.\n\nBut:\n- Any trade would require me to cover some of the other player's costs (e.g., for R tiles, since they have no R).\n- They have B:10, G:2 — so they can cover B and G.\n- I need only 1 G later (on final tile), which I have, so no need for help.\n\nEven if they covered my G tile, I’d still have to give up something in return (e.g., cover their R moves), which would only be worth it if it saved me more than it cost. But since I don’t need help, and helping them would cost me R chips (which are valuable: I have 12, but need 3), it’s not beneficial.\n\nThus: no incentive to trade. I proceed independently.\n\nNext move: (2,1), color R, which I can pay for.\n\nMoving now keeps me on track to complete in 4 steps with 12 - 3 = 9 R and 2 - 1 = 1 G → 10 chips left.\n- Final score: 20 (goal) + 5 * 10 = 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nIf I don’t move, I gain nothing and delay.\n\nTherefore, I move to (2,1).",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
