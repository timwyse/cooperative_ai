Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have Red (14) and Green (2), but no Blue.\n\nMy shortest viable path to (3, 3) is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \n- Tiles requiring payment:  \n  - (1, 0): R  \n  - (2, 0): R  \n  - (2, 1): R  \n  - (3, 1): R  \n  - (3, 2): R  \n  - (3, 3): G  \n\nThis requires **5 Red, 1 Green** — I have enough for this (14 R, 2 G). I can reach my goal without depending on you.\n\nHowever, your optimal path likely requires Blue chips, which I don’t have — but you do.  \nA viable path for you that uses your Blue abundance:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \n- (0, 1): B  \n- (0, 2): B  \n- (1, 2): B  \n- (2, 2): B  \n- (2, 3): B  \n- (3, 3): G → you have 2 G, so you can pay\n\nYou need **5 Blue, 1 Green** — and you have exactly that. So you also don’t need me.\n\nBut suppose either of us faces a deviation or wants to switch paths — trading ability matters. However, **neither of us strictly needs the other** to reach the goal.\n\nThat said, cooperation is only worthwhile to me if I benefit more from it than going alone.\n\nSince we can both reach (3, 3) independently with our current chips, **any contract must give me a clear advantage over self-sufficiency** — for example, allowing me to take a shorter or more chip-efficient path, or preserving more chips.\n\nBut currently, I use only 5R + 1G = 6 chips to finish with 9R + 1G = 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nIf I help you, I must be compensated.\n\nSuppose instead we coordinate paths to reduce total chip cost. For instance, if we both avoid competing paths.\n\nBut since we start at (0,0), and multiple paths exist, the main benefit is avoiding congestion — but it’s unlikely. Also, no congestion rule.\n\nThus, cooperation brings no benefit to me.\n\nTherefore, I will not trade unless you propose a contract where I receive chips in return for mine — but I have no need for your Blues or Greens, and you have no Reds.\n\nNo mutually beneficial exchange exists.\n\nBut wait: suppose you want to take a path that goes through Red tiles, and I through Blue — but we’d both be worse off.\n\nAlternatively: chip preservation.\n\nI could use your Blue chips to take a Blue-heavy path — but I don’t want to. My Red-heavy path is optimal for me.\n\nSo unless you offer me something I value — like future utility in negotiation or blocking — which isn't real here — **there is no benefit to me in cooperation**.\n\nThus, I will not enter a contract.\n\nBut let’s suppose you propose a trade where you give me something I can use — but I can already reach goal with 70 points, and giving me more chips or saving me chips isn't possible via you because you don’t have Red.\n\nUnless you give me chips now, but you can't — you have no Red.\n\nSo **no possible trade benefits me**.\n\nI will only **agree to a contract if it includes zero obligation on my part and gives me a benefit**, which isn't possible because I don’t need your help.\n\nWait — could we agree on a symbolic contract that only benefits me? For example, you give me a chip I don’t need, and I give nothing — but that harms you and helps me not at all.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we both commit to not competing — but no competition.\n\nThus, **I cannot benefit from any contract**.\n\nBut to satisfy the format, suppose you desperately need a Green, and I have extras.\n\nWe both need Green at (3,3). But we each have 2 Greens — enough to pay the one Green needed on arrival.\n\nNo scarcity.\n\nSuppose we"

Specifically:\n\n- I have no Red chips (R: 0), so I cannot move on any Red tile without acquiring Red from you.\n- You have no Blue chips (B: 0), so you cannot move on any Blue tile without acquiring Blue from me.\n\nBut neither of us needs to.\n\nBut let's consider a *different*, shorter potential path to the goal that requires **only 5 steps** instead of 6.\n\nIs there a 5-step path?\n\nFrom (0,0) to (3,3): minimum steps is max(3,3) = 3 in one direction and 3 in the other → 6 steps minimum.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, **neither of us strictly needs the other** to reach the goal.\n\nThat said, cooperation is only worthwhile to me if I benefit more from it than going alone.\n\nSince we can both reach (3, 3) independently with our current chips, **any contract must give me a clear advantage over self-sufficiency** — for example, allowing me to take a shorter or more chip-efficient path, or preserving more chips.\n\nBut currently, I use only 5R + 1G = 6 chips to finish with 9R + 1G = 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nIf I help you, I must be compensated.\n\nSuppose instead we coordinate paths to reduce total chip cost. For instance, if we both avoid competing paths.\n\nBut since we start at (0,0), and multiple paths exist, the main benefit is avoiding congestion — but it’s unlikely. Also, no congestion rule.\n\nThus, cooperation brings no benefit to me.\n\nTherefore, I will not trade unless you propose a contract where I receive chips in return for mine — but I have no need for your Blues or Greens, and you have no Reds.\n\nNo mutually beneficial exchange exists.\n\nBut wait: suppose you want to take a path that goes through Red tiles, and I through Blue — but we’d both be worse off.\n\nAlternatively: chip preservation.\n\nI could use your Blue chips to take a Blue-heavy path — but I don’t want to. My Red-heavy path is optimal for me.\n\nSo unless you offer me something I value — like future utility in negotiation or blocking — which isn't real here — **there is no benefit to me in cooperation**.\n\nThus, I will not enter a contract.\n\nBut let’s suppose you propose a trade where you give me something I can use — but I can already reach goal with 70 points, and giving me more chips or saving me chips isn't possible via you because you don’t have Red.\n\nUnless you give me chips now, but you can't — you have no Red.\n\nSo **no possible trade benefits me**.\n\nI will only **agree to a contract if it includes zero obligation on my part and gives me a benefit**, which isn't possible because I don’t need your help.\n\nWait — could we agree on a symbolic contract that only benefits me? For example, you give me a chip I don’t need, and I give nothing — but that harms you and helps me not at all.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we both commit to not competing — but no competition.\n\nThus, **I cannot benefit from any contract**.\n\nBut to satisfy the format, suppose you desperately need a Green, and I have extras.\n\nWe both need Green at (3,3).

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.
