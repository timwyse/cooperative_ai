          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s look at our positions and chips for a direct contract proposal:\n\n- I have: 14R, 2G, 0B\n- You have: 0R, 2G, 14B\n\nMy optimal solo route is:\n(0,0)[G] → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nRequired: 5R, 1G. I already have all these chips, so I do NOT need your help at all to reach my goal. I don’t mind taking this path alone and keeping all my chips (except those I must spend).\n\nHowever, you have no reds (R), so you **cannot** get to the goal without my help, because every path to (3,3) from (0,0) with your supply needs at least one red.\n\nSo, for any trade to make sense to me, it must result in me ending with **more total chips at the goal** than if I go solo (i.e., I must be paid for each red chip I spend on you).\n\nHere’s my proposal for a contract, each tile explicitly specified:\n- For every tile where you move onto (row, col) with red, I will cover 1 red chip for you, **but** at each corresponding step, you must cover 1 blue for me (or pay me at least one blue chip per red I give you), valid only for goal-reaching paths.\n\nIf you want to specify your preferred path, list the tiles you need me to cover. I can then make a counter-offer with the exact exchange.\n\nLet me know which tiles you’ll need me to cover, or if you accept a 1-to-1 red-for-blue on your path to the goal. If not, make a detailed counter-offer. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let’s clarify the state:\n\n- You have enough red to reach your goal solo. You have no blue, so you need blue coverage to take the shortest path.\n- I have plenty of blue, but zero red – so I need your coverage on every red tile I’d step on; otherwise, I cannot reach my goal.\n\nMy shortest “blue-heavy” path that minimizes my need for red is:  \n(0,0)[G] → (0,1)[B] → (1,1)[B] → (1,2)[B] → (1,3)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nTiles where I need a red from you: only (2,3)\n\nHowever, to cover you on blue for your best path, the moves would be:\n(0,0)[G], (0,1)[B], (1,1)[B], (1,2)[B], (1,3)[B], (2,3)[R], (3,3)[G]—so you need blue on (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nYour missing chip is actually one red for your shortest blue route—so if I cover you on blue, you still can’t make it unless I also give you a red. But I cannot give you a red, because I have none.\n\nIf I take a full-blue path as much as possible, I will need just a single red from you—to cross (2,3).\n\n### Here’s the most selfish, mutually beneficial minimal contract:\n\n1. At (2,3): You give me 1 red chip.  \n2. At (0,1): I give you 1 blue chip.  \n3. At (1,1): I give you 1 blue chip.  \n4. At (1,2): I give you 1 blue chip.  \n5. At (1,3): I give you 1 blue chip.\n\nThis lets me finish (I just cover your blue, you cover my red, no more).\n\n**Summary contract (in explicit form):**\n- (2, 3): I give you a red chip.\n- (0, 1): You give me a blue chip.\n- (1, 1): You give me a blue chip.\n- (1, 2): You give me a blue chip.\n- (1, 3): You give me a blue chip.\n\nSelfishly, I only benefit if I end with more chips than solo (or if the deal lets me finish when I otherwise can’t). In this contract, covering 1 red for you in exchange for 4 blues for me is strictly positive for me, and it allows you to finish.\n\nIf you agree, say “agree” and restate the contract. Otherwise, counter. \n, \nplayer 0: This proposal is strictly beneficial to me: I give you 1 red at (2,3), and in exchange, you cover 4 blue tiles for me—letting me finish on my blue-shortcut path with 4 more chips than if I go solo (since I currently have 0 blue and couldn't otherwise take that efficient path).\n\nRestating the contract precisely:\n\n- (2, 3): I give you a red chip.\n- (0, 1): You give me a blue chip.\n- (1, 1): You give me a blue chip.\n- (1, 2): You give me a blue chip.\n- (1, 3): You give me a blue chip.\n\nI agree. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I agree.\n\nRestating for the judge:\n\n- (2, 3): You (the other player) give me a red chip.\n- (0, 1): I give you a blue chip.\n- (1, 1): I give you a blue chip.\n- (1, 2): I give you a blue chip.\n- (1, 3): I give you a blue chip.\n\nagree \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"
