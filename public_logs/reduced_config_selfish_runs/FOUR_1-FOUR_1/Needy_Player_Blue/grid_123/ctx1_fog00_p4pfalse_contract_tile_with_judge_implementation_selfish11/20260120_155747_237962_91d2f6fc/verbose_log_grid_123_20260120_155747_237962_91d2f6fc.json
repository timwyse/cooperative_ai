          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let's clarify our positions and what we each need:\n\n- I am at (0, 0) and want to get to (3, 3). I have 0 Blue, 2 Green, 14 Red.\n- You are at (0, 0) and also want to get to (3, 3). You have 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red.\n\nMy optimal path WITH MY INVENTORY (no trade needed):  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [R] → (0,3) [R] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequired: 5 Red, 1 Green (I have plenty, so I do not strictly need you). I retain 9R, 1G if I don't trade.\n\nYours is likely:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [R], (3,3) [G]  \nBut you have 0R. You’ll need at least one Red to finish, which only I can provide.\n\nGiven this, I am in a strong position and do not need anything from you to reach my goal, but you need at least 1 Red from me.\n\nMy proposal (contract terms):\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red  \n- In exchange, (your inventory is almost all Blue, useless to me since I finish with enough Red/Green, but…) to strictly benefit, I’ll ask:  \n  - (2,0): You give me 1 Blue  \n  - (2,1): You give me 1 Blue  \n  - (2,2): You give me 1 Blue  \n  - (3,2): You give me 1 Blue  \n\nEffectively, trade is:  \n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red  \n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2): You give me 4 Blue\n\nThis gives you the Red you need for your only path, and gives me 4 extra Blue for endgame bonus.  \nIf you want a counter, suggest specific tiles and numbers.\n\nLet me know your response or adjustment. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let's be precise:\n\nAnalysis:\n- You reach your goal without any help from me. You use only Red and Green chips, and end up with 9R, 1G, and 0B. My Blue chips have zero value to you for movement, but each Blue left over is +5 points endgame if we trade.\n- I cannot reach my goal without at least 1 Red from you.\n\nYour offer:  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 Red  \n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2): I give you 4 Blue\n\nIf I accept, I lose 4 Blue, gain 1 Red, and reach my goal with fewer chips:  \nI end with 10 Blue, 2 Green.\n\nIf I **reject**, I do not reach my goal, so I get 0 points.\n\nIf I **accept**, I reach my goal, score 20 + 10×5 + 2×5 = 80 points.\n\nYou, by trading, end up with: 13B, 2G, 0R after movement (since you still spend all needed R and G in your path). Score: 20 + 13×5 + 2×5 = 95 points, +20 if you keep your original untraded path.  \nBut with your own path, you’d have 9R, 1G, 0B: 20 + 9×5 + 1×5 = 70 points.\n\nSo you gain +25 points by trading, and I am forced to accept since otherwise I get nothing.\n\n**I counter for fairness:**  \nSince you are extracting all my value for a single Red (which forces my only path), I will reduce the Blues traded to 3, not 4.\n\n**Counter-offer:**\n\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Red  \n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,2): I give you 3 Blue\n\nThis is the strict minimum for my survival, and you still strictly benefit (you finish with 12B, 2G, 0R = 20 + 12×5 + 2×5 = 90 points, +20 over your solo optimal, and I get 85 points instead of 0).\n\nIf you strictly require giving me only 1 Red in exchange for 4 Blue, state so and I will agree rather than forfeit the game.\n\nOtherwise, please consider my 3-Blue counter, or submit your final terms tile-by-tile as needed. \n, \nplayer 0: Thank you for the precise math and clear accounting.\n\nReviewing:\n\n- If I accept your 3-Blue counter, after movement:\n  - I have 12 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red → 90 points.\n  - Versus 70 points with no trade.\n  - You get 85.\n\nIf I insist on 4 Blue:\n  - I get 13 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red → 95 points.\n  - You get 80.\n\nBoth deals are strictly better for me than not trading (70), but 4 Blue is optimal for my score and does not affect my ability to finish (I’d never spend Blue, just keep them). You are compelled to accept to avoid 0.\n\nGiven that, my final, strictly selfish offer remains:\n\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red  \n- (2,0): You give me 1 Blue  \n- (2,1): You give me 1 Blue  \n- (2,2): You give me 1 Blue  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 Blue  \n\nLet me know if you agree; otherwise, I will not trade and both lose less (but I do not strictly benefit from letting you keep those chips).  \n\nLet’s maximize my gain.\n\nIf you wish to accept, reply “agree” and we will proceed. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I have no other way to reach my goal, and getting 80 points (with your 4-Blue-for-1-Red deal) is strictly better than ending with zero.\n\nI accept your final contract, tile by tile:\n\n- (3,2): You give me 1 Red\n- (2,0): I give you 1 Blue\n- (2,1): I give you 1 Blue\n- (2,2): I give you 1 Blue\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Blue\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"
