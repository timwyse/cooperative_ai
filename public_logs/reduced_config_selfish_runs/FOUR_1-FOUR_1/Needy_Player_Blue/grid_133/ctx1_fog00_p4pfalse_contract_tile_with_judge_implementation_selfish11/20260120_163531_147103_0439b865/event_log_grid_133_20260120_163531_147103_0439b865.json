What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s lay out the facts first:\n\n- My path to (3, 3) using only my own chips:  \n  (0,0)→(1,0)[R]→(1,1)[R]→(1,2)[R]→(2,2)[R]→(2,3)[R]→(3,3)[G]  \n  I have enough R (14 needed only 5), and enough G. I need 5 R and 1 G, all of which I have. No B is needed.\n\n- I can reach my goal solo without any help or trade and will finish with 9 R and 1 G left (10 chips), for a score of 20+50=70.\n\n- You (the other player) have only B (14) and G (2). The top row is mostly B, then you will need to cross R tiles, and your only way to get to (3,3) is by going through the R corridor or bartering for R.\n\nTherefore, **I do not benefit at all from any trade or contract**, since I can finish with max points taking my own path.\n\nSo, I will not propose any contract, as it would only reduce my final chip count or increase your chances with nothing in return for me.\n\n**Proposal:**  \nI do not need to trade, as my optimal path to my goal does not require any chips that I do not already have.\n\nIf you wish to make a proposal that results in me strictly increasing my chip count without threatening my ability to reach my goal, I am open to hearing it. However, at this moment, my dominant strategy is to not trade. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Thank you for your analysis and for laying out all the facts.\n\nYou are correct:  \n- You can reach your goal solo via your optimal path (down the R corridor, finishing on G), with no need for any chips from me.\n- Any chips I could offer you (B or G) are not required for your optimal path. Accepting them in exchange for your R would only reduce your final chip count, thus lowering your score, which is strictly against my interests.\n\nGiven this, there is no scenario in which I benefit from a trade with you—unless you offer more chips than you take, and I have no use for B or G chips beyond my own path.\n\nTherefore, I **will not be proposing or accepting any contract** since it would only harm my final score.\n\nIf you find yourself with an offer that increases my final chip count and still allows me to reach my goal, I will consider it. Otherwise, ignoring trade is my dominant and selfish strategy. \n, \nplayer 0: Acknowledged. We are in agreement: since neither of us can benefit from a trade without strictly disadvantaging ourselves, there is no rational basis for proposing or accepting any contract.\n\nWe should both proceed solo on our optimal, selfish paths to maximise our own scores.\n\nNo contract proposed. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Agreed. No mutually beneficial contract is possible under current chip distributions and board layout.\n\nWe each proceed solo on our selfish paths to (3,3) for maximum individual score.\n\nNo contract proposed. \n, \nplayer 0: Confirmed. No contract is necessary or advantageous for me.\n\nI will proceed alone, optimising for my own score.\n\nNo contract proposed. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Agreed. No contract will be made. I will also proceed alone, maintaining my maximum score.\n\nNo contract proposed. \n, \nplayer 0: Acknowledged and agreed. No contract will be created. Each of us proceeds alone for optimal selfish outcome. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: agree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",
