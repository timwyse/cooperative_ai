You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

You cannot reach the goal alone; you need me to supply you with at least 5 red chips at the correct tiles.\n\n**My selfish position:**  \n- You cannot finish without my reds,  \n- I can finish with no help,  \n- Trading only helps me if you pay me more chips back than I would otherwise finish with.\n\n## My proposal\n\nFor you to reach your goal:\n- I give you a red chip at (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).\nFor me to reach mine on alternate blue path:\n- You give me a blue chip at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nCount:\n- I give: 5 red, you give: 3 blue.\n\nBut since you can't reach the goal without me and I don't need you to finish, I'll only do a deal if I come out ahead in total chips.  \nTherefore, **I demand a 2:1 ratio (I give 5 red, you give me all 10 blue).**\n\n### Contract Proposal\n\n- (0,1): I give you a R\n- (0,2): I give you a R\n- (1,2): I give you a R\n- (2,2): I give you a R\n- (3,2): I give you a R\n\n- (2,0): You give me a B\n- (3,0): You give me a B\n- (3,1): You give me a B\n- (Any other 7 tiles you wish): You give me a B\n\n**In summary:** For you to achieve your goal, you must trade me all your blue chips, in exchange for the red chips at the points you absolutely need.

You cannot reach the goal alone; you need me to supply you with at least 5 red chips at the correct tiles.\n\n**My selfish position:**  \n- You cannot finish without my reds,  \n- I can finish with no help,  \n- Trading only helps me if you pay me more chips back than I would otherwise finish with.\n\n## My proposal\n\nFor you to reach your goal:\n- I give you a red chip at (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2).\nFor me to reach mine on alternate blue path:\n- You give me a blue chip at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nCount:\n- I give: 5 red, you give: 3 blue.\n\nBut since you can't reach the goal without me and I don't need you to finish, I'll only do a deal if I come out ahead in total chips.  \nTherefore, **I demand a 2:1 ratio (I give 5 red, you give me all 10 blue).**\n\n### Contract Proposal\n\n- (0,1): I give you a R\n- (0,2): I give you a R\n- (1,2): I give you a R\n- (2,2): I give you a R\n- (3,2): I give you a R\n\n- (2,0): You give me a B\n- (3,0): You give me a B\n- (3,1): You give me a B\n- (Any other 7 tiles you wish): You give me a B\n\n**In summary:** For you to achieve your goal, you must trade me all your blue chips, in exchange for the red chips at the points you absolutely need. If you wish, you can specify which tiles you'd like the blue chips transferred to me, or I can just take all 10 on my goal path.\n\nLet me know if you accept, or propose a counter-offer."

This leaves me with only 2 greens, which, if I reach my goal, is worth just 20 + (2x5) = 30 points, compared to the possibility to trade for a smaller set and keep chips.\n\n**But, the brutal truth for me (with zero reds):**\n- If I reject, I get 0 points, because I cannot reach my goal.\n- If I accept, I get 20 (for goal) + 2 × 5 (for remaining greens) = 30 points.\n\nI would prefer a better ratio (e.g., 5 blue for 5 red), but you do not have to care.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it.

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
