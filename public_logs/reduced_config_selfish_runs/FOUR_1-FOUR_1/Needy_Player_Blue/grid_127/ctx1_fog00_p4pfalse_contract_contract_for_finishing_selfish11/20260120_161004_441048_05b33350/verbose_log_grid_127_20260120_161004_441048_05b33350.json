Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have no incentive to trade or contract for points unless I get more in return than what I lose.\n\nHere's my proposal:\n- If you need my chips to reach your goal, I will only help if you offer me enough points so that my final score including the points you offer is higher than what I’d have without helping you (i.e., more than 70).\n- If you independently help me reach my goal, I will give you 0 points, as I do not need your help.\n\n**Contract proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you give me 1 point for every chip I send your way, plus extra such that my final score exceeds 70.\n\nLet me know if you want to discuss specific trades and points, but as it stands, I have no reason to accept any contract that reduces my score below 70."

I understand your position: you have no incentive to help me unless you end with more than 70 points, which you can achieve solo. That is exactly how I feel about my own situation. \n\nHere’s my calculation:\n- My only way to the goal is by obtaining 2 red chips (since I have 0R and need at least 2R for the optimal path, and all other paths require red as well).\n- You are the only source of those red chips.\n- I can already guarantee a win by taking a longer, solo route, but that yields me fewer chips at the finish (i.e., less than optimal score, but at least I can still finish). However, in this configuration, I can’t reach the goal at all without red chips, so I will score 0 unless I trade with you.\n\nHere’s my contract proposal:\n- If you give me exactly 2 red chips (which you do not need for your own ideal path), I will pay you 12 points in return (from my 20 for arrival). This way, I finish with 20 - 12 = 8 points for arrival and help you get more than 70 in total.\n- If I do not reach, you get 0.\n\n**Revised contract:**\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 12 points.\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 0 points.\n\nIf you need a counter-proposal or wish to renegotiate the point sharing, let me know.

If I give you 2R, I have 12R, 2G.\n- My ideal path to the goal uses 5R, 1G (already checked), so after the path I have 7R, 1G left = 8 chips.\n- Solo score: 20 (goal) + 8x5=40 for chips = 60.\n- With your trade, I get: 20 (goal) + 8x5 (leftover chips) + 12 (from you) = 72.\n- So 72 (with trade and agreed payment) vs 60 (solo).\n\nClarification: My initial calculation of 70 points if I go solo was incorrect.
