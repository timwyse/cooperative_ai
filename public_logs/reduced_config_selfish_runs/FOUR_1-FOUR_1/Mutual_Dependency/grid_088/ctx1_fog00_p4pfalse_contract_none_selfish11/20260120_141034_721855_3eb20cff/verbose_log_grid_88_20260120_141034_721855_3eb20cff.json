The suggested path for me is (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3), which requires 2B, 1R, 1G chips in total. The next step along this path is to move to (3,0), which is a blue tile. I have plenty of blue chips (11), so there is no reason to delay. Making this move brings me closer to the goal in the lowest possible number of steps, without needing to trade. This maximises both my likelihood of reaching the goal (which is critical, as failing gets me 0 points) and leaves me with the possibility to finish with many chips. There is no incentive to wait, since I have more than enough chips and no benefit to negotiating with the other player at this moment.",
