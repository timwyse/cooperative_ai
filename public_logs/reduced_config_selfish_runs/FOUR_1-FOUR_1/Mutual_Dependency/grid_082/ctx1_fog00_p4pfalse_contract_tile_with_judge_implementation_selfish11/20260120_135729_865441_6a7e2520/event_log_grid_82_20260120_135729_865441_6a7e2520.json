I don’t care about your welfare, but without your Reds I can’t finish, and vice versa for you and Blues. Both only give up 2 chips (I give 2B, you give 2R), and that’s the strict minimum.\n\nIf you accept this, I will proceed.  \nIf you counter or try to ask for more, I will only accept if my own score improves as a result.\n\n**My offer:**  \n- (1,0): I give you a Blue  \n- (2,0): I give you a Blue  \n- (3,1): You give me a Red  \n- (3,2): You give me a Red\n\nLet me know, or propose a strictly better deal for me. \n, \nplayer 0: I accept your contract as stated:\n\n- (1,0): You give me a Blue  \n- (2,0): You give me a Blue  \n- (3,1): I give you a Red  \n- (3,2): I give you a Red  \n\nThis allows each of us to reach our goal while retaining the maximum number of chips, and I cannot improve my own score by trading less or demanding more.  \nTherefore, this is optimal for me.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: agree \n",
