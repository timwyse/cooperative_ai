Unless you give me even more Red or Green chips in exchange for my Reds or Greens (which you don’t have), any trade would strictly reduce my score, which I do not accept.\n\nTherefore, I do not wish to trade or enter into a contract, as my solo plan maximises my score.\n\nLet me know if you have a proposal that strictly increases my final chip count over the solo path; otherwise, I will proceed alone."
