What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let me clarify exactly what I need and what you need, step by step:\n\n**My best route using my own chips**:  \n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Chips needed: Move sequence and tile colors:\n    - (1,0): R (I pay, I have)\n    - (2,0): R (I pay, I have)\n    - (2,1): R (I pay, I have)\n    - (3,1): R (I pay, I have)\n    - (3,2): R (I pay, I have)\n    - (3,3): G (I pay, I have)\n\nI can reach the goal using only my own chips (5 R, 1 G), and still have 9 Red and 1 Green chips left.  \n**I don’t need any chips from you to reach my goal safely for max score.**  \nIf you want to propose any trade or see if you benefit from using my chips, I’m willing to listen, but I will not give away chips unless it strictly increases my final score.\n\nDo you need any reds or greens to reach your own goal? If so, pitch me your best offer—otherwise, we might each be better off walking our own paths independently. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Thanks for spelling it out.

No contract proposed. \n, \nplayer 0: Agreed, there is no value in trading — we each have more than enough of the chips we need for our individual optimal paths, and neither of us benefits from offering chips to the other.\n\nLet’s proceed independently with no contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: agree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.
