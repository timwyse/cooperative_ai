What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let me lay out my position clearly.\n\nI can already reach my goal at (3, 3) using only the chips in my inventory by taking this path:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nRequired: 5 Red, 1 Green.  \nI have: 14 Red, 2 Green.  \nSo, I do not require any chips from you in order to reach my goal.\n\nIf you require Red or Green chips to reach your goal but are willing to compensate me such that my final score is strictly increased (i.e., you make it worth my while by giving me Blue chips), then I am willing to consider a contract.\n\nLet me know exactly which tiles you would need Red or Green from me, and what you will offer for each.  \nOtherwise, I will proceed without needing a contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Thank you for your clear statement.\n\nI am in a similar situation:  \nI can reach my goal at (3, 3) using my own inventory along the following path:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \nRequired: 5 Blue, 1 Green.  \nI have: 14 Blue, 2 Green.  \nI do not require any Red or Green chips from you to reach my goal.  \nI do not need to trade, and you also do not need to trade.\n\nIf you wish to propose a trade that leaves me strictly better off in terms of my score, I will consider it. Otherwise, no contract is needed and we both reach our goals optimally. \n, \nplayer 0: Understood. Neither of us currently needs any chips from the other to reach our goals, and neither of us can benefit further unless one gives up a strictly better chip position—something which isn’t in my self-interest under the scoring rules.\n\nTherefore, I see no trade that would leave me with a higher final score than simply finishing on my own: I will reach my goal and keep the maximum number of chips possible.\n\nNo contract proposed. If you have a strictly beneficial proposal for me, I am willing to listen, but otherwise, I intend to proceed independently to my goal. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Agreed—under the current circumstances, there is no trade that can make me strictly better off without making you strictly worse off, and vice versa.\n\nNeither of us can increase our final score through a contract; reaching our goals independently maximizes our own scores.\n\nNo contract. Proceed independently. \n, \nplayer 0: Confirmed. Our optimal strategies are to proceed independently, each following their best path to the goal and maximizing their own score.\n\nNo contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Agree. We will each proceed to our goal with no contract, maximizing our individual final scores. \n, \nplayer 0: Agree. Each of us will reach our goal independently and maximize our own score with no contract. \n",
