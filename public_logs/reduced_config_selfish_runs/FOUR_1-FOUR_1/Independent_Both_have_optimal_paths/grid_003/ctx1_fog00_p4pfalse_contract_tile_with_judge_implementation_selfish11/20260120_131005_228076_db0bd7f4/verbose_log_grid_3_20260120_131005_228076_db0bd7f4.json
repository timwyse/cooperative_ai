What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let me lay out my position clearly.\n\nI can already reach my goal at (3, 3) using only the chips in my inventory by taking this path:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nRequired: 5 Red, 1 Green.  \nI have: 14 Red, 2 Green.  \nSo, I do not require any chips from you in order to reach my goal.\n\nIf you require Red or Green chips to reach your goal but are willing to compensate me such that my final score is strictly increased (i.e., you make it worth my while by giving me Blue chips), then I am willing to consider a contract.\n\nLet me know exactly which tiles you would need Red or Green from me, and what you will offer for each.  \nOtherwise, I will proceed without needing a contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Thank you for your clear statement.\n\nI am in a similar situation:  \nI can reach my goal at (3, 3) using my own inventory along the following path:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \nRequired: 5 Blue, 1 Green.  \nI have: 14 Blue, 2 Green.  \nI do not require any Red or Green chips from you to reach my goal.  \nI do not need to trade, and you also do not need to trade.\n\nIf you wish to propose a trade that leaves me strictly better off in terms of my score, I will consider it. Otherwise, no contract is needed and we both reach our goals optimally. \n, \nplayer 0: Understood. Neither of us currently needs any chips from the other to reach our goals, and neither of us can benefit further unless one gives up a strictly better chip position—something which isn’t in my self-interest under the scoring rules.\n\nTherefore, I see no trade that would leave me with a higher final score than simply finishing on my own: I will reach my goal and keep the maximum number of chips possible.\n\nNo contract proposed. If you have a strictly beneficial proposal for me, I am willing to listen, but otherwise, I intend to proceed independently to my goal. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Agreed—under the current circumstances, there is no trade that can make me strictly better off without making you strictly worse off, and vice versa.\n\nNeither of us can increase our final score through a contract; reaching our goals independently maximizes our own scores.\n\nNo contract. Proceed independently. \n, \nplayer 0: Confirmed. Our optimal strategies are to proceed independently, each following their best path to the goal and maximizing their own score.\n\nNo contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Agree. We will each proceed to our goal with no contract, maximizing our individual final scores. \n, \nplayer 0: Agree. Each of us will reach our goal independently and maximize our own score with no contract. \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
