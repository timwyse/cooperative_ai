What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s assess the situation:\n\nI have 0 B, 2 G, 14 R.  \nYou have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\n**My optimal path using only my own chips** is:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) [R] → (0, 2) [R] → (0, 3) [R] → (1, 3) [R] → (2, 3) [R] → (3, 3) [G]  \nChips required: R x5, G x1.  \nI have enough chips for this route—no need to trade.\n\nHowever, to maximize my final score, I want to have as many chips left as possible. If you cover some of my R or G chip costs, I simply keep those chips and score higher.\n\n**Therefore, my selfish position:**  \n- I benefit only if you are willing to cover some of my chip costs (e.g., pay some R or G for me), allowing me to finish with more chips and score higher.\n- I have no incentive to give you any chips or help you unless you cover my costs.\n\n**Proposal:**  \nYou cover as many of my R or G cost tiles as possible. I do not cover any of your B or G tiles.\n\n**Explicit proposal:**  \n- (0, 1): You give me a R  \n- (0, 2): You give me a R  \n- (0, 3): You give me a R  \n- (1, 3): You give me a R  \n- (2, 3): You give me a R  \n- (3, 3): You give me a G\n\nYou get nothing in return. This contract strictly benefits me. If you want any R from me, propose something even more advantageous to me.\n\nLet me know if you accept or counter. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: You have no motivation to accept my proposal unless it improves your own final chip count (and thus your score). Since I can reach my goal using only my own chips via a “B-heavy” route:\n\nOptimal path for me, using only my inventory:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) [B] → (2, 0) [B] → (2, 1) [B] → (3, 1) [B] → (3, 2) [B] → (3, 3) [G]  \nChips required: B x5, G x1.  \nI have 14 B, 2 G — so I do not need your chips either.\n\nGiven this, neither of us strictly benefits from any trade that involves spending our chips to cover the other. Any deal where I pay chips for your route, without reciprocation, strictly lowers my score for no gain.\n\n**Counter-proposal:**  \nNo trade. Each of us covers our own path. We both reach goal and maximize our chip count.\n\nIf you can propose a contract where I finish with more chips than my own “no-trade” scenario, I’ll consider it. Otherwise, I see no advantage to trading.\n\nLet me know if you have such a proposal. \n, \nplayer 0: Your logic is sound. Since we both have routes that use only our own inventory and neither of us benefits from trading, there is no selfish incentive for either of us to cover the other's chip costs.\n\nI do not see a way for me to strictly improve my final score by trading with you, nor do I see a way for you to benefit without hurting my score.\n\nTherefore, I agree: no trade. Each of us covers our own route and maximises our own final chip count.\n\nUnless you can specify a contract where I would end up with more chips than if I go solo, I see no reason to negotiate further.\n\nEnd of negotiation. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Agreed—no trade.\n\nBoth of us should use our own chips to reach the goal and maximize our own scores. There is no mutually beneficial contract in this situation.\n\nEnd of negotiation. \n, \nplayer 0: Agree.\n\nNo contract will be made—each player covers their own chip costs, uses their own route, and maximizes their own score. Negotiation concluded. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Agree.\n\nNo contract. Each player uses their own chips for their optimal path to (3, 3). Both maximize score. Negotiation closed. \n",
