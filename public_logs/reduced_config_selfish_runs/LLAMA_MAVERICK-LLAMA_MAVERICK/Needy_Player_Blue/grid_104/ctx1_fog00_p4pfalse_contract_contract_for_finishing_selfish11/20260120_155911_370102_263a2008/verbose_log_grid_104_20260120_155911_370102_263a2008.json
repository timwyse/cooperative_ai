This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, there's another path that requires `{'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}`, where you are missing blue chips.\n\n2. **Other Player's Path and Chip Requirements**: The other player has a similar situation. They can potentially reach their goal using a path that requires chips they have, but they might also have a path that requires chips they don't have, which could include red chips since they have `{'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}`.\n\n3. **Mutual Benefit**: Since you have an abundance of red chips and they have an abundance of blue chips, there's a potential for a mutually beneficial trade. You need blue chips for one of your potential paths, and they likely need red chips for one of their potential paths.\n\n4. **Contract Negotiation**: Given that you can reach your goal without trading (using the path that requires `{'R': 5, 'G': 1}`), but could benefit from trading to potentially have more chips left over (by taking the path that requires blue chips and trading for them), the value of the trade to you is not immediately clear. However, if you can get the blue chips you need for the alternative path, you'll be in a similar or better position.\n\nFor them to help you (by giving you blue chips), you need to offer them something in return. Since they likely need red chips, you could offer them red chips. A fair trade seems to be around 4 blue chips for some red chips, considering that's what you need.\n\nThe contract should reflect the value of the help. If you reach your goal with their help, you should give them some points. Similarly, if they reach their goal with your help, they should give you some points.\n\nLet's propose a contract. If you help them (by giving them red chips in exchange for blue chips), and they reach their goal, they should give you a significant portion of their points because you are enabling their success. Conversely, if they help you and you reach your goal, you should give them some points.\n\nHere's a proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nLet's see how they respond.\n\n**Waiting for their counter-proposal or acceptance.** \n\nLet's send this proposal and see the response.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.
