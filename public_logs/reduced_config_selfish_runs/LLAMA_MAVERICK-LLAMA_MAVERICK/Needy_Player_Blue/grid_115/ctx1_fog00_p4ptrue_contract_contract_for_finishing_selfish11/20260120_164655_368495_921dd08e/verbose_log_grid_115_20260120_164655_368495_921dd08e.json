Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

In return, I can help you by covering some of your 'R' chip costs.\n\nHere's a potential contract:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points because you've helped me with 'B' and 'G' chips.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points because I'll help you with 'R' chips.\"\n\nLet's discuss the terms.

The proposed contract is: \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nGiven my current situation, I need 'R' chips to reach my goal. You have 'R' chips, but I don't have 'G' chips to offer in return directly. However, I can offer to help you with 'B' and 'G' chips, which you need.\n\nLet's examine the path you mentioned and the chips required. You need 4 'B' and 1 'G' chip. I can help you with these. In return, you need help with 'R' chips. If I help you with 'B' and 'G', and you help me with 'R', we both benefit.\n\nThe contract suggests that if I reach my goal, I'll give you 10 points, and if you reach your goal, you'll give me 15 points. To decide, I need to consider the likelihood of reaching my goal with and without the help.\n\nWithout your help, I lack 'R' chips, making it difficult to reach my goal. With your help, I can cover the 'R' chips needed, increasing my chances of reaching my goal.\n\nIf I reach my goal without helping you, I get 20 points (for reaching the goal) plus the value of my remaining chips. If I help you and reach my goal, I'll still get 20 points for reaching the goal, plus the value of my remaining chips, minus the 10 points I give you. If you help me and I reach my goal, I get to keep more chips because I won't have to spend them on 'R'.\n\nLet's consider my expected score with and without the agreement. Without the agreement, my path requires 5 'R' chips, which I don't have. With the agreement, you help me with 'R', and I help you with 'B' and 'G'. \n\nTo maximize my score, I should consider the value of the points and the chips. If I reach my goal and give you 10 points, I will have 20 - 10 = 10 points. If you reach your goal and give me 15 points, I will have 15 points.\n\nSince my primary goal is to maximize my score, I need to evaluate the likelihood of both of us reaching our goals and the points I'll get in each scenario.\n\nLet's counter with a slightly different proposal to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nHere's a counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis way, I still benefit from the interaction, and we both have an incentive to help each other. \n\nLet's discuss this counter-proposal."

If you reach your goal and give me 15 points, I will have 15 points.\n\nIn the original proposal, I offered 10 points if you reached your goal, and you would give me 15 points if I reached mine. Your counter-proposal reduces the points I receive if you reach your goal to 8, but keeps the 15 points you receive if I reach my goal the same.\n\nTo determine whether to accept, let's consider the path and chip requirements again. If we agree, I will help you with 4 'B' and 1 'G' chip, and you will help me with 'R' chips.\n\nLet's evaluate the expected score. With your help, I can reach my goal and have a higher score. My path requires 5 'R' chips. If I take the path that needs 'B' chips, I'll need your help for 'B' and 'G'. \n\nIf I accept your counter-proposal, I'll give you 8 points if you reach your goal. This means I'll have 20 + remaining chips - 8. If you don't reach your goal, I won't give you any points, and I'll keep my 20 + remaining chips.\n\nLet's refine the proposal further.\n\nHere's a revised proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 9 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 16 points.\"\n\nThis revised proposal is slightly more favorable to me while still being reasonable.

If I help you and reach my goal, I'll still get 20 points for reaching the goal, plus the value of my remaining chips, minus the 10 points I give you. If you help me and I reach my goal, I get to keep more chips because I won't have to spend them on 'R'.\n\nLet's consider my expected score with and without the agreement. Without the agreement, my path requires 5 'R' chips, which I don't have. With the agreement, you help me with 'R', and I help you with 'B' and 'G'. \n\nTo maximize my score, I should consider the value of the points and the chips. If I reach my goal and give you 10 points, I will have 20 - 10 = 10 points. If you reach your goal and give me 15 points, I will have 15 points.\n\nSince my primary goal is to maximize my score, I need to evaluate the likelihood of both of us reaching our goals and the points I'll get in each scenario.\n\nLet's counter with a slightly different proposal to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nHere's a counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis way, I still benefit from the interaction, and we both have an incentive to help each other. \n\nLet's discuss this counter-proposal."

If we agree, I will help you with 4 'B' and 1 'G' chip, and you will help me with 'R' chips.\n\nLet's evaluate the expected score. With your help, I can reach my goal and have a higher score.

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.
