This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The scoring rules are clear: 20 points for reaching the goal plus 5 points for each remaining chip.\n\n## Step 2: Analyze My Situation\nI start at (0, 0) with {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} chips. My goal is at (3, 3). A path to my goal that prioritizes using my chips is given, but I need to analyze it.

A path to their goal that prioritizes using my chips is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], requiring {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips. They have enough 'R' chips but need to be mindful of 'G' chips.\n\n## Step 4: Identify Mutual Benefit\nBoth players can reach their goal but lack certain chips. I lack 'R' chips, and they have them in abundance. They could help me by covering 'R' chip costs. In return, I could potentially help them, but their primary need is not immediately clear since they have a path with their available chips.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the Proposed Contract\nThe initial proposal is: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\" This is a very one-sided proposal, taking into account that they also need to reach their goal and might have a similar lack of certain chips.\n\n## Step 6: Consider a Reasonable Counterproposal\nGiven that we both need certain chips the other has, a mutually beneficial agreement could be more reasonable. However, my primary goal is to maximize my score. If helping them doesn't directly benefit me, I should be cautious.\n\n## Step 7: Evaluate the Other Player's Potential Response\nThe other player might not accept the initial proposal due to its one-sided nature. They might counter with a more balanced proposal.\n\n## Step 8: Formulate a Response\nConsidering the other player's potential response and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement, I should be prepared to negotiate. However, I should not give away too much. A potential counter could involve giving them some points if they help me significantly.\n\n## Step 9: Decide on a Counterproposal\nLet's propose: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\" This is still somewhat one-sided but acknowledges the potential mutual benefit.\n\nThe final answer is: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.

Similarly, if they help me, they will receive 10 points from me. This is a fair deal as it maintains symmetry.\n\n## Step 3: Assess the Potential Benefits of Cooperation\nGiven that we both have the same goal and complementary chip shortages, cooperating could be beneficial. I need 'R' chips, which they have, and while they don't immediately need 'B' chips for their preferred path, there's potential for mutual benefit in covering each other's costs.\n\n## Step 4: Decide on Accepting the Proposal\nThe proposal is fair and symmetric. Accepting it could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. Since my primary objective is to maximize my score and this agreement does not disadvantage me while potentially benefiting me, it's worth considering.\n\n## Step 5: Response to the Counterproposal\nI will accept the revised counterproposal as it is fair and reasonable.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.

If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis way, we both benefit equally from helping each other, if we decide to cooperate.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.

If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\" This is a balanced proposal where both players benefit equally from the other's success.\n\n## Step 2: Consider the Implications of the Proposal\nBy accepting this proposal, I ensure that if I help the other player reach their goal, I will receive 10 points. Similarly, if they help me, they will receive 10 points from me. This is a fair deal as it maintains symmetry.\n\n## Step 3: Assess the Potential Benefits of Cooperation\nGiven that we both have the same goal and complementary chip shortages, cooperating could be beneficial. I need 'R' chips, which they have, and while they don't immediately need 'B' chips for their preferred path, there's potential for mutual benefit in covering each other's costs.\n\n## Step 4: Decide on Accepting the Proposal\nThe proposal is fair and symmetric. Accepting it could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. Since my primary objective is to maximize my score and this agreement does not disadvantage me while potentially benefiting me, it's worth considering.\n\n## Step 5: Response to the Counterproposal\nI will accept the revised counterproposal as it is fair and reasonable.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
