My next move towards this path is to (1, 0), which is a 'R' tile. I don't have 'R' chips, so I need to either trade for 'R' chips or choose a different path. Since I don't have 'R' chips, moving to (1, 0) is not possible. An alternative path is (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) or (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3).

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.
