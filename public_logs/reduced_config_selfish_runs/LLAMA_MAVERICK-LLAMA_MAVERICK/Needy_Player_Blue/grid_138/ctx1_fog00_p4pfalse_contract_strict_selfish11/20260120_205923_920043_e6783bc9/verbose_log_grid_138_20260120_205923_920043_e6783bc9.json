The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'R': 5}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 2)]\n- You requested: [('R', 2)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (0, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 2)]\n- You requested: [('R', 2)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 2)]\n- You requested: [('R', 2)]\nThe other player ACCEPTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 1) to (2, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 1)]\n- You requested: [('G', 1)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'R': 5}\n- You: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
