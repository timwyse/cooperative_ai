Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points,\" we both have an incentive to cooperate. \n\nBy cooperating, I can get the 'B' chips I need (3 'B' chips) for a potentially more efficient path, and you can get the 'R' chips you need (5 'R' chips) for your path.\n\nFor me, reaching the goal without trading is possible but less efficient. With the chips I have, I can still reach the goal via the path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. So, while trading is beneficial, it's not crucial for me.\n\nHowever, for you, having 'R' chips is crucial for taking your preferred path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], as it requires 'R' chips.\n\nTo evaluate the fairness of the deal, let's consider the expected outcome.\n\nIf we cooperate and both reach our goals, we both get 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 (remaining chips, assuming we use the required chips for the path and have some remaining) = 25 points, and then exchange 10 points. So, the net score for each of us would be 25 - 10 + 10 = 25.\n\nHowever, if we don't cooperate, I can still reach my goal with my current chips, and my net score would be 20 + 5*(remaining chips after reaching the goal).\n\nFor you, not cooperating means you might not be able to take your preferred path, potentially losing score if you can't efficiently reach the goal.\n\nSince I can reach my goal without your 'R' chips, albeit not on the most efficient 'B' requiring path, I am somewhat in a stronger position. However, the counter-proposal is more balanced and ensures that we both have a clear incentive to cooperate.\n\nLet's slightly adjust the counter-proposal to reflect the fact that I have a backup plan.\n\nHere's a revised counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis takes into account that you need my help more than I need yours, but still provides an incentive for both of us to cooperate.\n\nLet's discuss this further."

The number of chips being exchanged is not equal, and I'm giving you fewer chips in number, but they're crucial for your path.\n\nGiven that I still benefit significantly from getting the 'R' chips, and you're getting a relatively smaller number of 'B' chips but still benefiting from the trade, the revised counter-proposal seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nTo slightly improve the deal for me, I could propose another adjustment.\n\nHere's a counter to your revised counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 7 points.

So, while trading is beneficial, it's not crucial for me.\n\nHowever, for you, having 'R' chips is crucial for taking your preferred path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], as it requires 'R' chips.\n\nTo evaluate the fairness of the deal, let's consider the expected outcome.\n\nIf we cooperate and both reach our goals, we both get 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 (remaining chips, assuming we use the required chips for the path and have some remaining) = 25 points, and then exchange 10 points. So, the net score for each of us would be 25 - 10 + 10 = 25.\n\nHowever, if we don't cooperate, I can still reach my goal with my current chips, and my net score would be 20 + 5*(remaining chips after reaching the goal).\n\nFor you, not cooperating means you might not be able to take your preferred path, potentially losing score if you can't efficiently reach the goal.\n\nSince I can reach my goal without your 'R' chips, albeit not on the most efficient 'B' requiring path, I am somewhat in a stronger position. However, the counter-proposal is more balanced and ensures that we both have a clear incentive to cooperate.\n\nLet's slightly adjust the counter-proposal to reflect the fact that I have a backup plan.\n\nHere's a revised counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis takes into account that you need my help more than I need yours, but still provides an incentive for both of us to cooperate.\n\nLet's discuss this further."

This does put you in a relatively stronger position.\n\nYour revised counter-proposal is: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis revised proposal is more in line with the relative needs of both parties. Since I need your help more to get the 'R' chips required for my preferred path, it's reasonable that I give you more points if you reach your goal.\n\nHowever, to further negotiate, let's consider the value of the chips being traded. I'm giving you 3 'B' chips, and you're giving me 5 'R' chips. The number of chips being exchanged is not equal, and I'm giving you fewer chips in number, but they're crucial for your path.\n\nGiven that I still benefit significantly from getting the 'R' chips, and you're getting a relatively smaller number of 'B' chips but still benefiting from the trade, the revised counter-proposal seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nTo slightly improve the deal for me, I could propose another adjustment.\n\nHere's a counter to your revised counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 7 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis way, I'm increasing the points I give you if I reach my goal, making the deal slightly more favorable to you while still keeping the overall structure of the agreement.\n\nLet's discuss this further."

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
