          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: To maximize my score, I need to reach the goal at (3, 3) with as many chips as possible. Let's analyze the given paths.\n\nThe first path provided, [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips. I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, so I have enough chips for this path.\n\nThe second path, [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], requires {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1} chips. I lack 'B' chips, but the other player has them.\n\nLet's consider the second path since it's a viable option that requires chips the other player has. I need 'B' chips at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 1), and also 'G' at (3, 3). I have 'G' at (3, 3), so I actually need 'B' at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 1).\n\nHere's a proposal:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a B\n(2, 0): You give me a B\n(3, 1): You give me a B\n\nIn return, I'll give you some of my 'R' chips since you don't have any. I need 5 'R' chips for the first path, and I'll have 9 'R' left. Let's give you 4 'R' chips.\n\nTo simplify, let's propose a trade at (2, 2) where I give you 'R' chips. I will be at (2, 2) after (2, 0), so it's a reasonable point for trade.\n\n(2, 2): I give you 4 R\n\nThe proposal is:\n(1, 0): You give me a B\n(2, 0): You give me a B\n(3, 1): You give me a B\n(2, 2): I give you 4 R\n\nWill you accept this proposal or would you like to modify it? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I'll consider your proposal.\n\nYou want me to give you 3 'B' chips at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 1), and in return, you will give me 4 'R' chips at (2, 2).\n\nLet's analyze this proposal. I currently have 0 'B' chips and 14 'R' chips. If I accept your proposal, I will give you 3 'B' chips, which I don't have, so I'll have to get them first. At the end of the game, I'll have 14 - 4 = 10 'R' chips.\n\nHowever, I can propose a counteroffer. I'll give you the 3 'B' chips you need, but I want 5 'R' chips instead of 4. Here's the counteroffer:\n\n(1, 0): I give you a B\n(2, 0): I give you a B\n(3, 1): I give you a B\n(2, 2): You give me 5 R\n\nConsider my counteroffer. If you're willing to accept it, type **agree**. Otherwise, propose a different trade. \n, \nplayer 0: Let's analyze your counteroffer. You're asking for 5 'R' chips instead of 4. I currently have 14 'R' chips, and I'll need 5 'R' for the first path. If I give you 5 'R', I'll be left with 14 - 5 - 5 = 4 'R' chips.\n\nTo decide whether to accept your counteroffer, let's compare the outcomes. If I don't trade, I'll take the first path and have 14 - 5 - 1 = 8 chips left (since I need 'R': 5 and 'G': 1 for the path). If I accept your counteroffer, I'll take the second path and have 14 - 5 (for the path) - 5 (for the trade) = 4 'R' chips left.\n\nAccepting your counteroffer results in having fewer 'R' chips (4) compared to not trading (8). So, it's not beneficial for me to accept your counteroffer.\n\nLet's propose a different trade. How about we stick with the original 4 'R' chips, and I'll give you an additional 'G' chip at (2, 2) since you need 'G' chips and I have them? However, I actually don't need to give you a 'G' chip because you already have 2 'G'. So, let's just stick with the original proposal.\n\nSince you're asking for more 'R' chips than I initially offered, I'll refuse the counteroffer and instead suggest we revisit the original terms or explore alternative paths that could be more mutually beneficial.\n\nLet's consider an alternative. If I take the first path [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], I won't need any 'B' chips from you. However, you might need some 'G' or 'R' chips from me for your path.\n\nLet's discuss an alternative trade based on your path. What's your preferred path, and what chips do you need from me? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Let's analyze the situation. You are at (0, 0) and your goal is at (3, 3), the same as mine.\n\nYou have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} chips, and I have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. \n\nOne of the paths provided is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}. You lack 'B' chips for this path.\n\nThe other path is [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], which requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. You have enough 'R' chips for this path.\n\nSince you have enough 'R' chips for the second path, let's consider the first path for you and see if we can help each other.\n\nFor your first path, you need 'B' chips. I can provide those. You need 'B' at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 1).\n\nLet's propose the following trade:\n(1, 0): I give you a B\n(2, 0): I give you a B\n(3, 1): I give you a B\n\nIn return, you can give me some 'R' chips. You have 14 'R' chips and need 2 'R' chips for the path, so you'll have 12 'R' chips left. If you give me 3 'R' chips, you'll be left with 9 'R' chips.\n\nLet's propose the trade at (2, 2):\n(1, 0): I give you a B\n(2, 0): I give you a B\n(3, 1): I give you a B\n(2, 2): You give me 3 R\n\nIs this acceptable to you? \n, \nplayer 0: Let's analyze the proposed trade.\n\nYou need 'B' chips for my first path, and you're proposing that I give you 3 'B' chips at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 1). In return, you'll give me 3 'R' chips at (2, 2).\n\nIf I accept this trade, I'll be taking the first path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1} chips. With your help, I'll have the 'B' chips I need.\n\nLet's calculate the outcome:\n\n* I have 14 'R' chips initially.\n* I'll use 2 'R' chips for the path.\n* I'll give you 3 'R' chips at (2, 2).\n* I'll be left with 14 - 2 - 3 = 9 'R' chips.\n\nIf I don't trade, I'll take the second path [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], which requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips. I'll be left with 14 - 5 = 9 'R' chips and 2 - 1 = 1 'G' chip.\n\nThe proposed trade doesn't change my final number of chips (9 'R' chips), so I'm indifferent between the two options in terms of the number of 'R' chips. However, I still have to use 1 'G' chip in both cases.\n\nSince the trade doesn't strictly benefit me, I'm not particularly inclined to accept it. However, I can consider a slight modification to make it more appealing.\n\nLet's stick with the proposed trade, but I want to negotiate the number of 'R' chips I give you. How about I give you 2 'R' chips instead of 3 at (2, 2)?\n\nThe revised proposal is:\n(1, 0): I give you a B\n(2, 0): I give you a B\n(3, 1): I give you a B\n(2, 2): You give me 2 R\n\nIs this acceptable to you? If so, type **agree**. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: Let's analyze the revised proposal.\n\nYou're suggesting that I give you 3 'B' chips at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 1), and in return, you'll give me 2 'R' chips at (2, 2).\n\nIf I accept this trade, I'll have the 'B' chips I need for your first path. Let's calculate the outcome:\n\n* I have 0 'R' chips initially.\n* I'll get 2 'R' chips from you at (2, 2).\n\nI'll end up with 2 'R' chips.\n\nWithout this trade, I wouldn't be able to take your first path, so this trade is beneficial for me.\n\nLet's accept the revised proposal.\n\nThe revised proposal is:\n(1, 0): You give me a B\n(2, 0): You give me a B\n(3, 1): You give me a B\n(2, 2): I give you 2 R\n\n**agree** \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Since I don't have a contract for 'R' chips, I'll consider an alternative path that doesn't require 'R' chips immediately.",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
