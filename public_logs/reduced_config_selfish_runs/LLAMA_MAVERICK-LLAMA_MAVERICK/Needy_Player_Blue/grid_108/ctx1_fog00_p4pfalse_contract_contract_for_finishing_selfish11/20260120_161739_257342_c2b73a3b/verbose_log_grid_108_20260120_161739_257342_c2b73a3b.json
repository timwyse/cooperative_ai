Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

My score will be 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 * (number of 'B' chips left after completing the path). \n\nIf I don't get the 'R' chip and still try to reach my goal, I'll fail because I lack the necessary 'R' chip, and my score will be 0.\n\nSo, getting the 'R' chip is crucial for me.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the contract. If I help you (by getting 'R' chips from you in exchange for 'B' chips), and you reach your goal, you'll give me 10 points. \n\nHowever, I can propose a trade where I give you some 'B' chips in exchange for the 'R' chip you have. A more straightforward approach might be to directly negotiate the points.\n\nGiven that I need your help to reach my goal (by getting the 'R' chip), and you're willing to help, a fair deal seems reasonable.\n\nLet's counter with a slightly different proposal: \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis reflects that I need your help more than you need mine, as I have a more pressing need for 'R' chips.\n\nYour turn to counter or accept."

I can reach my goal without your help using the path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, which I can fulfill with my current chip inventory. So, I don't strictly need your help to reach my goal.\n\nHowever, if we trade, I can potentially gain more points by helping you and getting something in return.\n\nIf I accept your proposal and help you by giving you 1 'R' chip in exchange for some 'B' chips (though the exact chip trade isn't specified, it's implied in the points negotiation), and you reach your goal, you'll give me 5 points. However, I can already reach my goal without your help.\n\nThe real question is whether I can benefit from this interaction. If I help you and you reach your goal, giving me 5 points, it's still not a significant gain for me since I was already capable of reaching my goal on my own.\n\nLet's make a more favorable proposal that still benefits both of us but leans in my favor since I'm the one with more flexibility.\n\nHere's a counter-proposal:\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 5 points.\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nThis reflects that you need my help more than I need yours. If you're willing to accept this, it means you'll still get some benefit from our interaction (reaching your goal with my 'R' chip), and I'll get some points for \"helping\" you, even though I didn't strictly need to.\n\nLet's see your response."

This is not beneficial for me since I need your 'R' chip to reach my goal, and in return, I'm only getting 5 points from you if you reach your goal. However, you can already reach your goal without my help.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the situation. If I don't get the 'R' chip from you, my score will be 0 because I won't be able to reach my goal. If I do get the 'R' chip and reach my goal, my score will be 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 * (number of chips left after completing the path).\n\nTo make it worth my while, I need a better deal. \n\nLet's propose another counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis way, you're incentivized to help me because if you don't, I won't be able to reach my goal, and you'll get 0 points from me anyway.

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
