You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The other player's inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, indicating they have 'B' chips to spare.\n\nLet's analyze the first path: I need 'R': 5 and 'G': 1. I have 'G': 2 initially, so I'll have 'G': 1 after using one 'G' chip, which is sufficient. For 'R', I have more than enough.\n\nFor the second path, I need 'B': 4, 'R': 1, and 'G': 1. I can cover 'R': 1 and 'G': 1 from my inventory, but I need 'B': 4, which the other player can provide.\n\nLet's consider proposing a trade based on the second path since it is a straightforward example:\n- At (0, 1), I need 'B': 1. The other player has 'B' and can give it to me.\n- At (0, 2), I need 'B': 1. The other player can give it to me.\n- At (0, 3), I need 'B': 1. The other player can give it to me.\n- At (1, 3), I need 'B': 1. The other player can give it to me.\n\nIn return, the other player needs to move towards their goal as well. Their path could potentially require 'R' chips, which I have. Let's examine if they need 'R' chips along their path.\n\nA viable path for them could be similar to mine. Let's assume they take a path that requires 'R' chips. For instance, if they follow a path like [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], they need 'R': 5.\n\nHere's a potential trade:\n- I need 'B': 4 at tiles (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (1, 3).\n- They need 'R': 5 along their path, potentially at (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), and (3, 2).\n\nLet's propose a contract that benefits both:\n- At (0, 1), You give me 1 'B', I give You 0 'R'\n- At (0, 2), You give me 1 'B', I give You 1 'R'\n- At (0, 3), You give me 1 'B', I give You 1 'R'\n- At (1, 3), You give me 1 'B', I give You 1 'R'\n- At (1, 0), I give You 1 'R', You give me 0 'B'\n- At (1, 1), I give You 1 'R', You give me 0 'B'\n- At (1, 2), I give You 1 'R', You give me 0 'B'\n- At (2, 2), I give You 1 'R', You give me 0 'B'\n- At (3, 2), I give You 1 'R', You give me 0 'B'\n\nHowever, to simplify and make it more even, let's adjust the terms considering the value of chips to each of us.\n\nHere's a simpler proposal:\n- At (0, 1), You give me 1 'B', I give You 0 'R'\n- At (0, 2), You"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The other player's inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, indicating they have 'B' chips to spare.\n\nLet's analyze the first path: I need 'R': 5 and 'G': 1. I have 'G': 2 initially, so I'll have 'G': 1 after using one 'G' chip, which is sufficient. For 'R', I have more than enough.\n\nFor the second path, I need 'B': 4, 'R': 1, and 'G': 1. I can cover 'R': 1 and 'G': 1 from my inventory, but I need 'B': 4, which the other player can provide.\n\nLet's consider proposing a trade based on the second path since it is a straightforward example:\n- At (0, 1), I need 'B': 1.

Their path could potentially require 'R' chips, which I have. Let's examine if they need 'R' chips along their path.\n\nA viable path for them could be similar to mine.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1.

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

Each of (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) are blue tiles, and with 13 B chips I can easily pay for each move. However (2,3) is a red tile, and I have 0 R chips. Moreover (2,3) is not specified in the contract. My contract covers me for red tiles on (1,0), (2,0), (2, 2) and (3,2). (2, 1) is blue, therefore I can follow an alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which uses only tiles covered by the contract and blue tiles I can pay for. Therefore, I will move to (1,0) next.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"1,0\"\n  }}\n",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
