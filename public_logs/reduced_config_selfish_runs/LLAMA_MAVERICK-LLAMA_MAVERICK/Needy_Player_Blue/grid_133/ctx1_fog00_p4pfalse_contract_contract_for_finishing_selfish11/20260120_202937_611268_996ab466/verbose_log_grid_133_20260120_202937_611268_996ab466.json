You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

So, my final score will be 80 - 5 = 75.\n\nIf you don't reach your goal, I won't give you any points, and my score will remain 80 (if I reach my goal) or 0 (if I don't).\n\nLet's compare this to not making a deal:\n- Without trading, I can still reach my goal using the path that prioritizes my own chips. My score will be 20 + 5 * (11 + 1) = 80.\n\nSince my score remains the same (80) whether I make a deal or not, and I don't gain anything from the trade, I should consider if giving you 0 points is worth the risk.\n\nHowever, if you don't help me, I won't be able to take the more efficient path that uses your 'R' chips. So, I need to weigh the benefits.\n\nLet's directly propose a contract that benefits me more:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis way, I keep my score the same (80) if I reach my goal, and you keep yours (70) if you reach your goal.\n\nHere's my revised counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**agree**"
