In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You are missing 'R' chips.\n   - A path that prioritizes using chips the other player has: Requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. You have enough 'B' and 'G' chips but lack 'R' chips.\n\nGiven the information, you need 'R' chips to reach your goal, and the other player needs 'B' chips. A mutually beneficial trade could be arranged where you provide 'R' chips to the other player in exchange for 'B' chips.\n\nThe proposal made is: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\" \n\nTo counter this proposal effectively, let's consider what's being offered and what's being asked:\n\n- You are asking for 20 points if the other player reaches their goal, in exchange for helping them with 'R' chips.\n- You are offering 0 points if you reach your goal.\n\nHowever, the counter-proposal should be based on a selfish strategy that maximizes your score.\n\nSince you need 'B' chips and the other player has them (indirectly, by having a path that requires 'B' and you having 'R'), a reasonable trade can be negotiated.\n\nLet's directly analyze the proposal:\n- If you help the other player (by covering some 'B' costs for them, but actually, you are offering 'R' chips), you are asking for 20 points.\n- The other player is being asked to give you 20 points if they reach their goal.\n\nA more balanced counter-proposal could involve considering what you both need. You need 'B' chips (and are willing to give 'R' chips in return), and they need 'R' chips.\n\nLet's suggest a counter-proposal that still benefits you but might be more acceptable to the other player.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis is a more balanced approach, considering you both are helping each other. However, my primary goal is to maximize my score, so let's directly evaluate the best response.\n\nTo maximize my score, I should aim to get the most out of this interaction while giving away as little as possible. \n\nHere's a more tailored response:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis maintains a high reward for me if the other player reaches their goal (since I'm helping them significantly with 'R' chips) and gives them a moderate incentive to help me.\n\nLet's wait for your response or counter-proposal."

The counter-proposal asks me to give you 20 points if I reach my goal, which is a lot. \n\nLet's make a counter-proposal that is more balanced.

You are missing 'R' chips.\n   - A path that prioritizes using chips the other player has: Requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.

If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\" \n\nTo counter this proposal effectively, let's consider what's being offered and what's being asked:\n\n- You are asking for 20 points if the other player reaches their goal, in exchange for helping them with 'R' chips.\n- You are offering 0 points if you reach your goal.\n\nHowever, the counter-proposal should be based on a selfish strategy that maximizes your score.\n\nSince you need 'B' chips and the other player has them (indirectly, by having a path that requires 'B' and you having 'R'), a reasonable trade can be negotiated.\n\nLet's directly analyze the proposal:\n- If you help the other player (by covering some 'B' costs for them, but actually, you are offering 'R' chips), you are asking for 20 points.\n- The other player is being asked to give you 20 points if they reach their goal.\n\nA more balanced counter-proposal could involve considering what you both need. You need 'B' chips (and are willing to give 'R' chips in return), and they need 'R' chips.\n\nLet's suggest a counter-proposal that still benefits you but might be more acceptable to the other player.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis is a more balanced approach, considering you both are helping each other. However, my primary goal is to maximize my score, so let's directly evaluate the best response.\n\nTo maximize my score, I should aim to get the most out of this interaction while giving away as little as possible. \n\nHere's a more tailored response:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis maintains a high reward for me if the other player reaches their goal (since I'm helping them significantly with 'R' chips) and gives them a moderate incentive to help me.\n\nLet's wait for your response or counter-proposal."

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 1, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [('R', 2)] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [('B', 2)] to Player 0.\", \"On turn 1, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 2)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 2)] to Player 1.\", \"On turn 2, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [('R', 2)] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [('G', 1)] to Player 0.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
