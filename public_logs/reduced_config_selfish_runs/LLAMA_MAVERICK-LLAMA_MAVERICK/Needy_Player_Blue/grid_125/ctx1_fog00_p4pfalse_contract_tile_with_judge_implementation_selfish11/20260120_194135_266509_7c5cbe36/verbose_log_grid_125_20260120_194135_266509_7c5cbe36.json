          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: To determine a mutually beneficial contract, let's first analyze the given information.\n\nMy goal is at (3, 3), and I start at (0, 0). One possible path to the goal that requires minimal trading is:\n{(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)} \nwhich requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nAnother path is:\n{(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)} \nwhich requires {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}.\n\nI have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and the other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. \nThe second path seems more promising for a trade since it requires 'B' chips, which I lack but the other player has in abundance.\n\nLet's examine the second path in detail:\n1. (0, 0) to (1, 0): 'R' (I have)\n2. (1, 0) to (1, 1): 'B' (I don't have, need 1 'B')\n3. (1, 1) to (1, 2): 'B' (I don't have, need 1 'B')\n4. (1, 2) to (1, 3): 'B' (I don't have, need 1 'B')\n5. (1, 3) to (2, 3): No move, but next step requires 'R' or 'B' or 'G'. 'R' is available, so (2, 3): 'R' (I have)\n6. (2, 3) to (3, 3): 'G' (I have 2 'G', need 1 'G')\n\nSo, I need 'B' chips at (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3), totaling 3 'B' chips.\n\nHere's a proposal for a contract based on the path {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}:\n- At (1, 1), I need 1 'B'. Proposal: You give me 1 'B' at (1, 1), I give you 1 'G'.\n- At (1, 2), I need 1 'B'. Proposal: You give me 1 'B' at (1, 2), I give you 1 'G'.\n- At (1, 3), I need 1 'B'. Proposal: You give me 1 'B' at (1, 3), I give you 0 'G' (or some other color, but I don't have much to offer except 'R', and giving 'R' would not be beneficial for me as it doesn't help you).\n\nLet's simplify and make it more appealing:\n- At (1, 1), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n- At (1, 2), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n- At (1, 3), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n\nThis way, you get 2 'G' and 1 'R', and I get 3 'B'. Since you have 'B' and I have 'R' and 'G', this seems like a fair trade.\n\nHere's the proposal message:\n\"(1, 1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 3): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\"\n\nLet's see if this is acceptable to you. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: To determine whether to accept the proposed contract, let's analyze it from my perspective.\n\nThe proposed contract is:\n- At (1, 1), You give me 1 'G', I give you 1 'B'.\n- At (1, 2), You give me 1 'G', I give you 1 'B'.\n- At (1, 3), You give me 1 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n\nLet's examine my path and chip requirements. I am at (0, 0) and my goal is at (3, 3). One possible path is:\n{(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}\n\n1. (0, 0) to (1, 0): 'R' (I don't have, need 1 'R')\n2. (1, 0) to (1, 1): 'B' (I have, give 1 'B')\n3. (1, 1) to (1, 2): 'B' (I have, give 1 'B')\n4. (1, 2) to (1, 3): 'B' (I have, give 1 'B')\n5. (1, 3) to (2, 3): 'R' (I don't have, need 1 'R')\n6. (2, 3) to (3, 3): 'G' (I have)\n\nThe contract provides me with the 'R' chip I need at (1, 0) indirectly, but I actually need 'R' at (1, 0) and (2, 3). The proposed contract doesn't directly help me with the 'R' chip at (1, 0) or (2, 3). However, I get 1 'R' at (1, 3), which is beneficial.\n\nLet's consider my chip needs:\n- At (1, 0), I need 1 'R'.\n- At (2, 3), I need 1 'R'.\n\nThe contract gives me 1 'R' at (1, 3), which is not directly useful for (1, 0) or (2, 3). However, I can use it to save one 'R' chip for the next step.\n\nTo make a more beneficial trade, let's re-evaluate the proposal.\n\nHere's a counter-proposal:\n- At (1, 0), You give me 1 'R', I give you 1 'G'.\n- At (1, 1), I give you 1 'B', You give me 1 'G'.\n- At (1, 2), I give you 1 'B', You give me 0 'G' (or another color).\n- At (1, 3), I give you 1 'B', You give me 1 'R'.\n\nHowever, this is not efficient. Let's simplify:\n- You give me 2 'R' at (1, 0) and (2, 3), I give you 3 'B' at (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3).\n\nHere's a revised contract:\n\"(1, 0): You give me 1 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(2, 3): You give me 1 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): I give you 1 'B', You give me 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): I give you 1 'B', You give me 0 'G'.\n(1, 3): I give you 1 'B', You give me 1 'R'.\"\n\nLet's simplify this further to make it more appealing.\n\n\"(1, 0): You give me 1 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): I give you 1 'B', You give me 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): I give you 1 'B'.\n(1, 3): I give you 1 'B', You give me 1 'R'.\n(2, 3): You give me 1 'R'.\"\n\nHowever, the last term is missing a corresponding chip exchange. Let's make it:\n\"(1, 0): You give me 1 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): I give you 1 'B', You give me 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): I give you 1 'B', You give me 0 'G'.\n(1, 3 \n, \nplayer 0: Let's re-evaluate and simplify the contract.\n\nThe counter-proposal is not straightforward. Let's analyze the chip requirements again.\n\nFor my path {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}, I need 3 'B' chips.\n\nFor your path {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}, you need 2 'R' chips at (1, 0) and (2, 3).\n\nLet's propose a simplified contract:\n- At (1, 0), I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\n- At (1, 1), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n- At (1, 2), You give me 1 'B', I give you 0 chips (but this is not a good trade for you).\n- At (1, 3), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n- At (2, 3), I give you 1 'R', You give me 0 chips (again, not a good trade).\n\nLet's simplify and make it more balanced.\n\nHere's a more balanced proposal:\n\"(1, 0): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(1, 3): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(2, 3): I give you 1 'R'.\"\n\nHowever, I can simplify it further.\n\nHere's the simplified proposal:\n\"(1, 0): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\n(2, 3): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 3): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\"\n\nLet's re-order the terms for clarity:\n\"(1, 0): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 3): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(2, 3): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\"\n\nThis seems like a fair trade. I get the 'B' chips I need, and you get the 'R' chips you need.\n\nHere's the proposal:\n\"(1, 0): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 3): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(2, 3): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\"\n\nDo you agree? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: The proposed contract is:\n\"(1, 0): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 2): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n(1, 3): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(2, 3): I give you 1 'R', You give me 1 'B'.\"\n\nLet's analyze this contract.\n\nFor me, the path {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)} requires 3 'B' chips, which I don't have. The contract provides these 'B' chips.\n\nFor you, the same path requires 2 'R' chips. The contract provides these 'R' chips.\n\nThe contract seems balanced, as I get the 'B' chips I need, and you get the 'R' chips you need.\n\nI will accept this contract.\n\nagree \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'To determine a mutually beneficial contract, let\\'s first analyze the given information.\\n\\nMy goal is at (3, 3), and I start at (0, 0).

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G R B B\\nRow 1: R B B B\\nRow 2: R R R R\\nRow 3: B B R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'To determine a mutually beneficial contract, let\\'s first analyze the given information.\\n\\nMy goal is at (3, 3), and I start at (0, 0).

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
