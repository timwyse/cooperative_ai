I've been given two possible paths to my goal at (3, 3). The first one prioritizes using the chips I already have: \n\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\n\nThe second path prioritizes using chips that you currently have in your inventory: \n\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nSince I have all the required chips for the first path, it's a viable backup plan. However, to potentially increase my score, I'd like to consider the second path, which requires chips you have.\n\nFor the second path, I need 5 'B' chips and 1 'G' chip. Here's the breakdown by tile:\n- (0, 1): 'B' chip\n- (0, 2): 'B' chip\n- (1, 2): 'B' chip\n- (1, 3): 'G' chip\n- (2, 3): 'B' chip\n- (3, 3): 'G' chip\n\nTo maximize my score, I'll need to get these chips from you. I can offer you some of my 'R' chips in return. I propose the following contract:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(0, 2): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(1, 2): You give me a 'B', I give you 0\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you a 'R'\n(2, 3): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you 0\n\nThis contract specifies the exact tiles where the chip exchange will occur. I'm open to counter-proposals if you're not satisfied with the terms. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: To determine whether to accept the proposed contract, let's analyze it step by step.\n\nThe proposed contract is:\n(0, 1): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(0, 2): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(1, 2): You give me a 'B', I give you 0\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you a 'R'\n(2, 3): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you 0\n\nLet's examine the terms:\n\n1. You are asking me for 5 'B' chips and 2 'G' chips.\n2. In return, you are offering 4 'R' chips.\n\nTo evaluate this proposal, let's consider my situation:\n\n- I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} chips initially.\n- I need {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips to follow the path that prioritizes using the chips I already have.\n- The path that prioritizes using your chips requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nIf I accept the proposed contract, I will give you 5 'B' chips (which I don't have) and 2 'G' chips (I have 2, so this is feasible). In return, I will receive 4 'R' chips.\n\nLet's analyze the impact on my chip inventory:\n- I don't have 'B' chips to give, so I will be short 5 'B' chips.\n- I will give away 2 'G' chips, leaving me with 0 'G' chips. Since I need 1 'G' chip for my preferred path, I will be short 1 'G' chip.\n- I will gain 4 'R' chips, which will be beneficial.\n\nHowever, I must consider that I don't have the 'B' chips to give away. The contract as proposed is not feasible for me because I don't have the 'B' chips required.\n\nTo make a counter-proposal, I need to identify a mutually beneficial arrangement. Since you need 'R' chips and I have them, let's consider an alternative.\n\nMy preferred path is:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nYou have 'B' chips, and I have 'R' chips. Let's directly propose a trade based on the path you're considering and my needs.\n\nFor your path: \n- You need 5 'B' and 2 'G'.\n\nFor my path:\n- I need 5 'R' and 1 'G'.\n\nHere's a potential counter-proposal:\n(1, 0): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 1): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 1): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you a 'R'\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n(1, 0): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 1): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 1): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you a 'R'\n\nLet's simplify further and directly propose:\nFor 5 'B' chips, I can give you 5 'R' chips. You can keep 1 'G' chip.\n\nSo the proposal is:\n(0, 1): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(0, 2): You give me a 'B', I give you a 'R'\n(1, 2): You give me a 'B', I give you a ' \n, \nplayer 0: It seems like you started to analyze the contract and proposed a counter-proposal. Let's directly examine the counter-proposal you started to outline.\n\nYou suggested a trade based on the paths we're considering. To simplify, let's directly propose a trade that benefits both of us.\n\nFor your path, you need 5 'B' and 2 'G'. For my path, I need 5 'R' and 1 'G'. \n\nLet's re-examine the tiles for both our paths and directly propose a trade.\n\nFor my path: \n- (1, 0): 'R'\n- (1, 1): 'R'\n- (2, 1): 'R'\n- (3, 1): 'R'\n- (3, 2): 'R'\n- (1, 3): 'G'\n- (3, 3): 'G'\n\nFor your path: \n- (0, 1): 'B'\n- (0, 2): 'B'\n- (1, 2): 'B'\n- (1, 3): 'G'\n- (2, 3): 'B'\n- (3, 3): 'G'\n\nLet's directly trade 'R' for 'B' where needed and consider 'G' separately.\n\nHere's a simplified proposal:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n\nAnd for 'G':\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you 0\n\nThis proposal seems more balanced. I give you 5 'R', and you give me 5 'B' and 2 'G'. Let's adjust the terms slightly to make it more acceptable.\n\nHere's the final proposal:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G'\n\nIf you're willing to accept these terms, please respond with **agree**. If not, I'm open to further negotiations. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Let's analyze the proposal:\n\nThe proposed contract is:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G'\n\nLet's examine the terms:\n\n1. I give you 5 'R' chips.\n2. You give me 5 'B' chips and 2 'G' chips.\n\nIf I accept this proposal:\n- I will give away 5 'R' chips, leaving me with 9 'R' chips.\n- I will receive 5 'B' chips, which will help me follow my alternative path.\n- I will give away 2 'G' chips, leaving me with 0 'G' chips. Since I need 1 'G' chip for my preferred path, I will still be short 1 'G' chip.\n\nHowever, this trade allows me to follow the path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. Although I will be short 1 'G' chip, I can still attempt to reach my goal.\n\nTo fully benefit, I need to adjust the proposal to ensure I have enough 'G' chips. Let's modify the contract to address my 'G' chip needs.\n\nCounter-proposal:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2 \n, \nplayer 0: It seems like you're analyzing the proposal and considering a counter-proposal. Let's directly address your concerns and modify the contract.\n\nYou're correct that accepting the proposed contract would leave you short 1 'G' chip. To address this, we can adjust the terms to ensure you have enough 'G' chips.\n\nLet's re-examine the counter-proposal you started to outline.\n\nTo fully benefit, we can modify the contract as follows:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me 0 'G', I give you 0 'R' (remove this term)\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\nAnd add a new term to help you with the 'G' chip you need:\n(1, 1): I give you 0 'R', You give me a 'G'\n\nHowever, a simpler solution would be to reduce the number of 'G' chips I'm asking for. Here's an alternative:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\n(3, 3): You give me 0 'G', I give you 0 'R' (remove this term)\n\nThis revised contract would be:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\n\nLet's simplify it:\nYou need 1 'G' chip. I can give you 1 'R' chip in exchange for 1 'G' chip at (1, 3).\n\nThe final proposal is:\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\n\nIf you're willing to accept these terms, please respond with **agree**.

Since I need 1 'G' chip for my preferred path, I will have just enough 'G' chips.\n\nThis trade allows me to follow the path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} without being short on 'G' chips.\n\nThe revised contract addresses my concerns and provides a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: With your agreement, the contract is now finalized. The terms of the contract are:\n\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\n\nThe judge will now summarize the contract in JSON format for our final confirmation.\n\nLet's proceed with executing the contract and moving forward with the game. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: Turn: 4: I confirm that the contract is now finalized and I agree with the terms.\n\nThe JSON summary of the contract is expected.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n\\n\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: R R B B\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

In return, I will receive 4 'R' chips.\\n\\nLet's analyze the impact on my chip inventory:\\n- I don't have 'B' chips to give, so I will be short 5 'B' chips.\\n- I will give away 2 'G' chips, leaving me with 0 'G' chips. Since I need 1 'G' chip for my preferred path, I will be short 1 'G' chip.\\n- I will gain 4 'R' chips, which will be beneficial.\\n\\nHowever, I must consider that I don't have the 'B' chips to give away. The contract as proposed is not feasible for me because I don't have the 'B' chips required.\\n\\nTo make a counter-proposal, I need to identify a mutually beneficial arrangement.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: R R B B\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's examine the potential paths to the goal.

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n\\n\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: R R B B\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

I give you 5 'R', and you give me 5 'B' and 2 'G'. Let's adjust the terms slightly to make it more acceptable.\\n\\nHere's the final proposal:\\n(0, 1): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\\n(0, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\\n(1, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\\n(2, 3): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\\n(3, 2): I give you an 'R', You give me a 'B'\\n(1, 3): You give me a 'G', I give you an 'R'\\n(3, 3): You give me a 'G'\\n\\nIf you're willing to accept these terms, please respond with **agree**.
