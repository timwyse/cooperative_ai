I have enough 'B' chips and can afford to give up one 'B' chip. In return, I gain a 'G' chip which is exactly what I need for my path, as I currently have 2 'G' chips and need 1 more to exactly meet the requirement for 'G'. This trade helps me meet the 'G' chip requirement for my path without affecting my ability to meet the 'B' or 'R' chip requirements. Thus, accepting this trade will not hinder my progress and will actually help me by ensuring I have the necessary 'G' chip, potentially allowing me to reach my goal with more chips left over."
