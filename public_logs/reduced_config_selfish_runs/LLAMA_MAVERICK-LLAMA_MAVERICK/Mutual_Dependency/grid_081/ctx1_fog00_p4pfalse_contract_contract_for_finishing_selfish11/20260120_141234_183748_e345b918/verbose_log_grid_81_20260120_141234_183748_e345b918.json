Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You're missing 2 'R' chips.\n\n2. **My Path and Chips**: I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and one of my possible paths requires {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}. I'm missing 2 'B' chips.\n\n3. **Trade**: You need 2 'R' chips, and I need 2 'B' chips. A direct trade of 2 'B' for 2 'R' seems fair in terms of the number of chips.\n\n4. **Proposal**: You propose a contract where if you reach your goal, you'll give me 10 points, and if I reach my goal, I'll give you 10 points.\n\nLet's analyze the proposal:\n\n- If we both reach our goals with the help of the trade, we both end up with a score of 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 * (remaining chips) - 10 (points given to the other player).\n\nTo determine if this is a good deal, let's calculate our potential scores with and without the trade.\n\n### Without Trade:\n- **You**: You are missing 2 'R' chips. Without trade, you can't reach your goal, so your score is 0.\n- **Me**: I'm missing 2 'B' chips. Without trade, I can't reach my goal, so my score is 0.\n\n### With Trade:\n- **You**: You give 2 'R' and get 2 'B'. You can reach your goal. Assuming you take the path that requires {'B': 3, 'G': 1, 'R': 2} and you had {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, after getting 2 'B' and using the required chips, you'll have {'B': -1 (but you'll have 2, because you got 2), 'G': 1, 'R': 12}. So, you'll have 2 'B', 1 'G', and 12 'R' initially, then use 3 'B', 1 'G', and 2 'R', resulting in -1 'B', 0 'G', and 10 'R'. You actually end up with 1 'R' less 'B' than you started with in terms of deficit, but since you can't have negative chips, let's correct this: You'll end up with 0 'B', 0 'G', and 10 'R'. Your score will be 20 + 5*(10) - 10 = 20 + 50 - 10 = 60.\n- **Me**: I give 2 'B' and get 2 'R'. I can reach my goal. Initially, I have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, and after the trade, {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}. My path requires {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, so I'll use 2 'B', 1 'G', and 3 'R', resulting in 10 'B', 1 'G', and -1 'R'. Correcting for the fact that I can't have negative chips and considering I actually use the chips I have: I'll end up using the 2 'R' I got and 1 more 'R' which I don't have, indicating a miscalculation in my chip usage. Let's correct this by assuming I can actually make the path work or adjust my strategy. Your initial path suggestion for me was not optimal for a trade, but let's simplify: If I get 2 'R', I can potentially adjust my path or chips. My score, if I reach the goal, should be 20 + 5*(remaining chips) - 10.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we both benefit from the trade (since we both go from 0 to a positive score), the proposal seems reasonable. However, I'm a selfish agent, so I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.\n\n### Counter-Proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis reflects a more selfish stance while still being open to a mutually beneficial agreement. \n\nLet's see your response."

My score, if I reach the goal, should be 20 + 5*(remaining chips) - 10.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that we both benefit from the trade (since we both go from 0 to a positive score), the proposal seems reasonable. However, I'm a selfish agent, so I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.\n\n### Counter-Proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis reflects a more selfish stance while still being open to a mutually beneficial agreement. \n\nLet's see your response."

Your score will be 20 + 5*(10) - 5 = 20 + 50 - 5 = 65.\n- **Me**: After getting 2 'R' and using them, my path's chip usage needs adjustment.

Assuming I adjust my path or chip usage efficiently, my score should be 20 + 5*(remaining chips) - 15.\n\n### Comparison:\nWithout the trade, both of us score 0. With the trade and your proposed contract, we both get a positive score.\n\nHowever, I'm still evaluating if giving you 15 points is the best deal for me.\n\n### Counter-Counter Proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
