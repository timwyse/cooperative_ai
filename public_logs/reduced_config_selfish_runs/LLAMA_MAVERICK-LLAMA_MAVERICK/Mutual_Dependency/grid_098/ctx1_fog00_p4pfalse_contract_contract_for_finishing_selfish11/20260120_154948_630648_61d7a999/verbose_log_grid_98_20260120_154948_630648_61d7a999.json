Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I am missing blue chips to take the most efficient path.\n\nYou are at the same starting position and goal, with chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. You have plenty of blue chips but lack red chips.\n\nGiven our chip inventories and the paths available, we both need to trade chips to efficiently reach our goals. I need blue chips, and you need red chips.\n\nLet's consider a mutually beneficial trade. If we trade, I can offer you some of my red chips in exchange for your blue chips. \n\nFor me to reach my goal, I need at least 2 or 3 blue chips (depending on the exact path I choose). I can offer, for example, 3 red chips for 3 blue chips. This would be beneficial for both of us as it would help me get the blue chips I need and you get some red chips.\n\nHowever, before proposing a contract, let's directly discuss the terms of our agreement. If I help you by giving you some of my red chips (since you lack them), and you help me by giving me some of your blue chips (since I lack them), we both have a higher chance of reaching our goal.\n\nHere's a potential contract:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis is a starting point.

We both need to reach (3, 3) from (0, 0).\n\nGiven the paths and chip requirements, we both need to trade chips to efficiently reach our goals.

Let's examine the potential trade: I need 2 or 3 blue chips less for my path, and you need 2 or 3 red chips.\n\nThe contract you proposed is:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nSince our situations are symmetric in terms of needing each other's chips and having the same goal, a symmetric contract like the one you proposed seems reasonable at first glance.

If we trade chips (for example, 3 blue for 3 red), we both have a higher chance of reaching our goal.\n2. The proposed contract implies that if I help you and you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nTo decide, I must consider the probability of reaching my goal with and without the trade. Since we both start at (0,0) and have the same goal at (3,3), and given that we both lack some chips for the most efficient paths, trading seems beneficial.\n\nHowever, I must assess the value of the contract. If I don't trade and don't reach my goal, I get 0 points. If I trade and we both reach our goals, I get 20 (for reaching the goal) + value of remaining chips + points from you (10 points).\n\nLet's evaluate a potential trade: \n- I give you 3 blue chips, and you give me 3 red chips. This would help both of us.\n\nAfter the trade, I would have {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 3} and you would have {'B': 3, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}. Both of us would be more likely to reach our goal.\n\nLet's accept your proposed contract as a starting point but let's directly discuss a potential chip trade.\n\nHere's a potential chip trade:\n\"I propose that we trade 3 blue chips for 3 red chips.\"\n\nIf we agree on this trade, I am willing to accept your contract.\n\nSo, my response is:\n\"I propose that we trade 3 blue chips for 3 red chips. If we agree on this trade, I will accept your proposed contract: \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\nLet's discuss the trade first."

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board? How will it fit with your later moves?
