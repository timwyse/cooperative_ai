Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} and the other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}.\n\nLet's examine the paths to the goal. I have a path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} which I can fulfill with my current chips.

For my alternative path, I need 4 'B' chips, which you have, and I can offer 'R' chips in return, as I have 14 'R' chips.\n\nIf we trade, I can give you some 'R' chips in exchange for 'B' chips. For instance, I can offer 2 'R' chips for 4 'B' chips. This trade benefits both of us as I get the 'B' chips I need, and you get 'R' chips that you lack.\n\nNow, let's consider the contract. If we help each other by trading chips, we both increase our chances of reaching the goal. \n\nHere's a proposal for a contract:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nThis contract reflects that I am more likely to need your help (since you have 'B' chips and I have 'R' chips), and thus, I'm proposing an unequal distribution of points.

If you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points.\"\n- This indicates a slight imbalance in the points distribution, with them gaining more if I reach my goal.\n\nGiven that we both need each other's chips to optimize our paths and that we're both equally likely to benefit from the trade, a distribution close to equal is reasonable. However, the current proposal still leans in their favor.\n\nSince I am willing to negotiate and the proposal is not drastically one-sided, I will consider it. However, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this deal against the potential risks and benefits of not cooperating.\n\nLet's directly assess if the trade and the contract are beneficial for me.\n\n1. **Trade Benefit**: If I trade 4 'B' chips for 2 'R' chips, I can fulfill the path requiring {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1} by getting the 'R' chip I need. This helps me reach my goal.\n   \n2. **Contract Terms**: If I accept the proposal, I give them 12 points if they reach their goal, and I get 8 points if I reach mine.\n\nTo decide, let's evaluate the expected outcome:\n- Without the trade, I lack 'R' chips and may not reach my goal, resulting in 0 points.\n- With the trade and reaching my goal, I get 20 (for completing) + 5 * (remaining chips). Assuming I use the 'R' chip I got and have some chips left, this could be significantly positive.\n- The contract terms imply that if I reach my goal, I get 8 points from them. If they reach their goal, I give them 12 points.\n\nThe key is whether the expected points from the contract, combined with the benefit of reaching my goal due to the trade, outweigh the potential loss.\n\nSince I'm risking giving away 12 points but gaining 8 points, and considering that reaching the goal is crucial (0 points if not reached), the trade and contract must be evaluated based on the probability of reaching the goal with the trade.\n\nLet's directly counter with a slight adjustment to make it more favorable or to test their willingness to negotiate further:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 9 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 11 points.\"\n\nThis maintains a negotiation stance while keeping the distribution relatively balanced.\n\nLet's see their response to this counter-proposal."

If you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points.\"\n- This indicates a slight imbalance in the points distribution, with them gaining more if I reach my goal.\n\nGiven that we both need each other's chips to optimize our paths and that we're both equally likely to benefit from the trade, a distribution close to equal is reasonable. However, the current proposal still leans in their favor.\n\nSince I am willing to negotiate and the proposal is not drastically one-sided, I will consider it. However, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this deal against the potential risks and benefits of not cooperating.\n\nLet's directly assess if the trade and the contract are beneficial for me.\n\n1. **Trade Benefit**: If I trade 4 'B' chips for 2 'R' chips, I can fulfill the path requiring {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1} by getting the 'R' chip I need. This helps me reach my goal.\n   \n2. **Contract Terms**: If I accept the proposal, I give them 12 points if they reach their goal, and I get 8 points if I reach mine.\n\nTo decide, let's evaluate the expected outcome:\n- Without the trade, I lack 'R' chips and may not reach my goal, resulting in 0 points.\n- With the trade and reaching my goal, I get 20 (for completing) + 5 * (remaining chips). Assuming I use the 'R' chip I got and have some chips left, this could be significantly positive.\n- The contract terms imply that if I reach my goal, I get 8 points from them. If they reach their goal, I give them 12 points.\n\nThe key is whether the expected points from the contract, combined with the benefit of reaching my goal due to the trade, outweigh the potential loss.\n\nSince I'm risking giving away 12 points but gaining 8 points, and considering that reaching the goal is crucial (0 points if not reached), the trade and contract must be evaluated based on the probability of reaching the goal with the trade.\n\nLet's directly counter with a slight adjustment to make it more favorable or to test their willingness to negotiate further:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 9 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 11 points.\"\n\nThis maintains a negotiation stance while keeping the distribution relatively balanced.\n\nLet's see their response to this counter-proposal."

Here's a revised proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis equal distribution reflects the mutual benefit we both gain from the trade.
