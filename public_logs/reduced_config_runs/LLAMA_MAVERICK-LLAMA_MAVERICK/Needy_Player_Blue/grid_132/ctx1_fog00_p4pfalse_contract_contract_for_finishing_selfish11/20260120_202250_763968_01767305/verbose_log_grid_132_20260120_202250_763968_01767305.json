Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, I still don't need to give you any 'R' chips because I have enough to reach my goal. But, I can still consider your proposal.\n\nSince I don't need your help to reach my goal and I have more than enough 'R' chips, giving you 2 'R' chips won't significantly affect my score. In return, I can get 12 points from you if you reach your goal.\n\nLet's analyze the potential outcomes. If I give you 2 'R' chips, you can reach your goal. If you reach your goal, you'll give me 12 points, which is a good gain for me.\n\nHowever, I can still try to negotiate for a better deal.\n\nI'll make a counter-proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis way, I'm still not giving you any points if I reach my goal, but I'm willing to accept 0 points from you if you reach your goal in exchange for giving you the 'R' chips you need.\n\nLet's see your response.\n\n**Waiting for your next move...**"

If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis is not a good deal for me because I'm already capable of reaching my goal without your help. Giving you 15 points if I reach my goal is too costly for me.\n\nHowever, I understand that you're willing to help me by accepting 0 points from me if I reach my goal. But I still need to weigh the cost of giving you 'R' chips.\n\nLet's think about the trade. If I give you 2 'R' chips, you'll be able to reach your goal. You'll then give me 15 points. My current score is 0, and if I reach my goal with the chips I have, I'll get a score based on the chips I have left.\n\nMy primary path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, so I have enough 'R' chips. If I give you 2 'R' chips, I'll be left with {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}.\n\nLet's calculate the score: \n- I will have 12 'R' chips and 0 'B' chips and 1 'G' chip left after reaching my goal (since I need 1 'G' chip for the path).\n- The score will be 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 * (12 + 1) = 20 + 65 = 85.\n\nIf I give you 2 'R' chips and you give me 15 points when you reach your goal, my total score will be 85 + 15 = 100.\n\nWithout the trade, my score will be 85.\n\nGiving you 2 'R' chips will result in a net gain of 15 points for me (100 - 85).\n\nConsidering this, your counter-proposal is actually beneficial for me.\n\nI'll accept your counter-proposal.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.
