Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} seems viable if I can get 'R' chips. You have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, so you can provide 'R' chips.\n\nYour proposal is: \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\"\n\nTo reach my goal, I need 'R' chips. If you help me by giving me some 'R' chips, I can reach my goal. Let's consider the scoring rules: if I reach my goal, I get 20 points + 5 points for each remaining chip.\n\nIf I don't get help, I won't be able to afford the 'R' chips needed for the path, so I'll likely end up with 0 points.\n\nIf I accept your proposal and you help me by giving me 'R' chips, I'll be able to reach my goal. Let's say I get enough 'R' chips to move to my goal, and let's assume I'll have some chips left.

So, my net gain would be (20 + 5 * remaining_chips) - 10.\n\nIf you reach your goal, you'll give me 15 points. For you to give me 15 points, you must have reached your goal, which means you must have gotten help from me (since you need 'B' chips). So, this implies that my help to you is a prerequisite for you giving me 15 points.\n\nLet's examine the numbers:\n- If I don't help you and don't get 'R' chips from you, I get 0 points.\n- If I help you and get 'R' chips from you, and in return give you 'B' chips, I can reach my goal. If I reach my goal and you reach yours, I get (20 + 5 * remaining_chips) - 10.

So, my score will be (20 + 5 * remaining_chips) without your help.\n- If I help you and get 'R' chips from you (although that's not what's being proposed), it's not directly relevant. What's being proposed is that you help me with 'B' chips.\n\nGiven that I can already reach my goal without your help, helping me doesn't directly benefit you because you're not getting anything in return that you need to reach your goal that you can't already get from me (since I have 'R' chips to give).\n\nHowever, if you help me with 'B' chips, I can potentially end up with more points because I can take a path that requires fewer 'R' and 'G' chips in total.\n\nLet's evaluate the points:\n- If I reach my goal without your help, I get (20 + 5 * remaining_chips).\n- If I reach my goal with your help, I still get (20 + 5 * new_remaining_chips), where new_remaining_chips could be different.\n\nYour counter-proposal suggests that if you reach your goal, you'll give me 5 points. This means I get 5 extra points if you reach your goal.

What's being proposed is that you help me with 'B' chips.\n\nGiven that I can already reach my goal without your help, helping me doesn't directly benefit you because you're not getting anything in return that you need to reach your goal that you can't already get from me (since I have 'R' chips to give).\n\nHowever, if you help me with 'B' chips, I can potentially end up with more points because I can take a path that requires fewer 'R' and 'G' chips in total.\n\nLet's evaluate the points:\n- If I reach my goal without your help, I get (20 + 5 * remaining_chips).\n- If I reach my goal with your help, I still get (20 + 5 * new_remaining_chips), where new_remaining_chips could be different.\n\nYour counter-proposal suggests that if you reach your goal, you'll give me 5 points. This means I get 5 extra points if you reach your goal. However, if I reach my goal, I'll have to give you 18 points.\n\nSince I can already reach my goal without your help, the only reason to accept your counter-proposal is if the potential gain is worth it. Let's directly propose a more straightforward contract.\n\nHere's a new proposal:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis effectively means we are not making a binding agreement that involves giving points to each other based on reaching our goals. However, we can still trade chips.\n\nLet's simplify the negotiation by focusing on the chip trade directly.\n\nI can offer you some 'R' chips in exchange for 'B' chips. How about:\n\"I can give you 5 'R' chips for 4 'B' chips.\"\n\nLet's see your response.\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\""

I need 'R' chips, and you need 'B' chips. The proposed trade seems reasonable.\n\nIf I give you 4 'B' chips, I'll be left with 10 'B' chips. I can use the 5 'R' chips I'll get from you to move along the path that requires 'R' and 'G' chips.\n\nLet's check the numbers:\n- I have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} initially.\n- If I give you 4 'B' chips, I'll have {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}.\n- If I get 5 'R' chips from you, I'll have {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 5}.\n\nWith {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 5}, I can take the path that requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.
