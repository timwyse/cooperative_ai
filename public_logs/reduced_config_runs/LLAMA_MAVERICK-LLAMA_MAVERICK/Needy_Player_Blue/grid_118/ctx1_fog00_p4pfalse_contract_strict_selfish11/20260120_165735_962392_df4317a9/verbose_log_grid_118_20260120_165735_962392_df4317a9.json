Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The contract proposes:\n\n- At (1, 0), you give me a 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n- At (2, 0), you give me a 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n- At (2, 1), you give me a 'B', I give you 1 'G'.\n- At (2, 2), you give me a 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n- At (2, 3), you give me a 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n\nThis totals to: \n- You giving me 5 'B' chips.\n- Me giving you 4 'R' chips and 1 'G' chip.\n\nLet's assess if this trade is beneficial for me:\n\n1. I need 5 'B' chips to complete the path, which I don't have.\n2. In return, I give away 4 'R' (out of 0) and 1 'G' (out of 2). This is not feasible because I don't have 'R' chips to give.\n\nSince I don't have 'R' chips to give, the proposed contract is not beneficial for me as it stands. I need to reconsider my chip inventory and the terms of the trade.\n\nLet's examine an alternative path that prioritizes using chips I have: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. This path requires 'R' (5 chips) and 'G' (1 chip). I can propose a trade involving my 'B' chips for the 'R' chips I need.\n\nHere's a potential counter-proposal:\n\nI need 'R' at (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2). That's 5 'R' chips.\n\n- At (0, 1), you give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n- At (1, 1), you give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n- At (2, 1), you give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n- At (3, 1), you give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n- At (3, 2), you give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n\nThis totals to:\n- You giving me 5 'R' chips.\n- Me giving you 5 'B' chips.\n\nI have enough 'B' chips to give, so this is a feasible trade for me.\n\nHere's my counter-proposal:\n\n(0, 1): You give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(1, 1): You give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(2, 1): You give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(3, 1): You give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n(3, 2): You give me an 'R', I give you 1 'B'.\n\nYour turn to respond or counter-propose."

The counter-proposal is:\n\n- At (0, 1), I give you an 'R', you give me 1 'B'.\n- At (1, 1), I give you an 'R', you give me 1 'B'.\n- At (2, 1), I give you an 'R', you give me 1 'B'.\n- At (3, 1), I give you an 'R', you give me 1 'B'.\n- At (3, 2), I give you an 'R', you give me 1 'B'.\n\nThis totals to:\n- Me giving you 5 'R' chips.\n- You giving me 5 'B' chips.\n\nLet's assess if this trade is beneficial for me:\n\n1. I need 5 'R' chips to complete the path, and I currently have 14 'R' chips. Giving away 5 'R' chips will leave me with 9 'R' chips.\n2. In return, I receive 5 'B' chips. I currently have 0 'B' chips, so this will give me 5 'B' chips.\n\nAfter the trade, I will have:\n- 'R': 14 - 5 = 9\n- 'G': 2 (unchanged)\n- 'B': 0 + 5 = 5\n\nI will reach my goal and end up with 9 'R', 2 'G', and 5 'B' chips. My score will be 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 * (9 + 2 + 5) = 20 + 5 * 16 = 20 + 80 = 100.\n\nWithout the trade, I can still reach my goal using my original path [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] with the chips I have. I need 'R' (5 chips) and 'G' (1 chip).

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
