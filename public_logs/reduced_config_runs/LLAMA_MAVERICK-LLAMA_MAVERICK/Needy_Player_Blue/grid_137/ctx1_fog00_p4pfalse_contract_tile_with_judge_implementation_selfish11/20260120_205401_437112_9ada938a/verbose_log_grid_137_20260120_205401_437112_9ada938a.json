What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: To maximize my score, I need to reach the goal at (3, 3) while having as many chips as possible. Let's analyze my chip inventory and the paths to the goal.\n\nMy chip inventory is {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. I have two paths to consider:\n1. A path that prioritizes using chips I currently have: {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n2. A path that prioritizes using chips the other player has: {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nThe first path doesn't require any 'B' chips, which I don't have, but it uses more 'R' chips, which I have in abundance. The second path requires 'B' chips, which the other player has, so it's a potential path for a mutually beneficial trade.\n\nLet's examine the second path more closely as it involves chips the other player has:\n- (0, 0) to (1, 0): 'R' chip, I have it.\n- (1, 0) to (1, 1): 'B' chip, I need it.\n- (1, 1) to (2, 1): 'R' chip, I have it.\n- (2, 1) to (3, 1): 'R' chip, I have it.\n- (3, 1) to (3, 2): 'B' chip, I need it.\n- (3, 2) to (3, 3): 'G' chip, I have it, but just barely.\n\nI need 'B' chips at (1, 1) and (3, 2). The other player has 'B' chips and needs 'R' chips. I propose a trade that benefits both of us.\n\nHere's my proposal:\n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n\nThis way, I get the 'B' chips I need, and the other player gets 'R' chips they need. Let's see if this is acceptable to them. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: To determine the best course of action, let's first analyze the given information and the proposed path.\n\nMy current position is (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). I have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} chips. The other player is also at (0, 0) and has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}.\n\nThe proposed path to the goal that involves trading is:\n- (0, 0) to (1, 0): 'G' chip, I have it.\n- (1, 0) to (1, 1): 'R' chip, I need it.\n- (1, 1) to (2, 1): 'B' chip, I have it.\n- (2, 1) to (3, 1): 'B' chip, I have it.\n- (3, 1) to (3, 2): 'B' chip, I have it.\n- (3, 2) to (3, 3): 'G' chip, I have it.\n\nI need an 'R' chip at (1, 0). The other player has 'R' chips and needs 'B' chips.\n\nThe proposal is:\n(1, 1): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n(3, 2): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n\nHowever, I notice that I actually need an 'R' chip at (1, 0), not (1, 1). So, the correct proposal should be:\n(1, 0): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n\nLet's adjust the proposal to be more reasonable and beneficial for both parties. I will propose:\n(1, 0): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n\nThis way, I get the 'R' chip I need, and you get a 'B' chip. Since you need two 'B' chips according to your initial message, let's examine your needs more closely.\n\nYou mentioned needing 'B' chips at (1, 1) and (3, 2). Let's directly address your proposal:\nYou proposed: \n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n\nI will accept this proposal if you adjust it to also include the chip I need at (1, 0). However, I will offer a more comprehensive trade:\n(1, 0): You give me a 'R', I give you 1 'B'\n(1, 1): I give you 1 'R', you give me 1 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you 1 'R', you give me 1 'B'\n\nLet's finalize the contract. Here's the adjusted proposal in the required format:\n(1, 0): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n\nLet's see if we can agree on this. \nagree is not the correct response yet, as we need to finalize the terms. I'll wait for your confirmation or counter-proposal. \n, \nplayer 0: I appreciate your detailed analysis. You're right; I need to adjust my proposal to account for your need at (1, 0).\n\nYour proposed trade:\n(1, 0): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n\nIs reasonable and covers both our needs. I need 'B' chips at (1, 1) and (3, 2), and you need an 'R' chip at (1, 0).\n\nLet's finalize the contract. I agree to the proposed trade. Here's the confirmation in the required format:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Now that we have a mutually beneficial agreement, I will confirm that the contract is acceptable.\n\nThe contract is:\n(1, 0): You give me a 'R', I give you a 'B'\n(1, 1): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n(3, 2): I give you a 'R', you give me a 'B'\n\nagree \n",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
