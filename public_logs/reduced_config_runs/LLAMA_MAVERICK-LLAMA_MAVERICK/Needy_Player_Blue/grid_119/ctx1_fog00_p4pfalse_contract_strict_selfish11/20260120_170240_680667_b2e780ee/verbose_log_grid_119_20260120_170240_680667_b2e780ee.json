This path requires `{'R': 5, 'G': 1}`.\n\n2. **Other Player's Chips:**\n   - The other player has `{'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}`. You need to leverage their chip inventory to your advantage.\n\n3. **Your Initial Proposal:**\n   - Looking at the path `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`, you need 'R': 5 and 'G': 1. You have 'G': 2, so you can afford 'G': 1. However, you need 'R': 5, and you have 'R': 14, which is sufficient.\n   - The other path `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]` requires `{'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}`. You can benefit from trading for 'B': 4 since you don't have 'B'.\n\nLet's examine the tiles for the second path:\n- `(0, 0)`: 'G' (you have it)\n- `(1, 0)`: 'R' (you have it)\n- `(2, 0)`: 'B' (you need it)\n- `(3, 0)`: 'B' (you need it)\n- `(3, 1)`: 'B' (you need it)\n- `(3, 2)`: 'B' (you need it)\n- `(3, 3)`: 'G' (you have it)\n\nYou need 'B': 4. The other player has 'B': 14, so they can afford to give you 'B': 4.\n\nHere's a proposal based on the second path:\n- At `(2, 0)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n- At `(3, 0)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n- At `(3, 1)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n- At `(3, 2)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n\nIn return, you can offer 'R' since you have plenty. Let's propose:\n- At `(1, 0)`, you give 'R' to the other player.\n- At `(1, 1)`, you give 'R' to the other player.\n- At `(1, 2)`, you give 'R' to the other player (though this is not necessary for the path, you have excess 'R' and this could be a fair trade).\n\nHowever, sticking strictly to the path `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`, a simpler proposal is:\n- `(2, 0)`: You get 'B'\n- `(3, 0)`: You get 'B'\n- `(3, 1)`: You get 'B'\n- `(3, 2)`: You get 'B'\nIn return, you give 'R' at a tile where it benefits the other player, e.g., `(1, 0)` or `(1, 1)` or `(1, 2)` or `(2, 3)` is not on this path but `(1, 1)` is 'R'.\n\nLet's propose:\n- `(2, 0)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(3, 0)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(3, 1)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(3, 2)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(1, 0)`: I give you 'R'\n\nHere's the proposal message:\n\"(2, 0): You give me 'B'\n(3, 0): You give me 'B'\n(3, 1): You give me 'B'\n(3, 2): You give me 'B'\n(1, 0): I give you 'R'\n**agree** if you accept this contract.\"\n\nLet's"

The other player has 'B': 14, so they can afford to give you 'B': 4.\n\nHere's a proposal based on the second path:\n- At `(2, 0)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n- At `(3, 0)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n- At `(3, 1)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n- At `(3, 2)`, you get 'B' from the other player.\n\nIn return, you can offer 'R' since you have plenty. Let's propose:\n- At `(1, 0)`, you give 'R' to the other player.\n- At `(1, 1)`, you give 'R' to the other player.\n- At `(1, 2)`, you give 'R' to the other player (though this is not necessary for the path, you have excess 'R' and this could be a fair trade).\n\nHowever, sticking strictly to the path `[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`, a simpler proposal is:\n- `(2, 0)`: You get 'B'\n- `(3, 0)`: You get 'B'\n- `(3, 1)`: You get 'B'\n- `(3, 2)`: You get 'B'\nIn return, you give 'R' at a tile where it benefits the other player, e.g., `(1, 0)` or `(1, 1)` or `(1, 2)` or `(2, 3)` is not on this path but `(1, 1)` is 'R'.\n\nLet's propose:\n- `(2, 0)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(3, 0)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(3, 1)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(3, 2)`: You give me 'B'\n- `(1, 0)`: I give you 'R'\n\nHere's the proposal message:\n\"(2, 0): You give me 'B'\n(3, 0): You give me 'B'\n(3, 1): You give me 'B'\n(3, 2): You give me 'B'\n(1, 0): I give you 'R'\n**agree** if you accept this contract.\"\n\nLet's"
