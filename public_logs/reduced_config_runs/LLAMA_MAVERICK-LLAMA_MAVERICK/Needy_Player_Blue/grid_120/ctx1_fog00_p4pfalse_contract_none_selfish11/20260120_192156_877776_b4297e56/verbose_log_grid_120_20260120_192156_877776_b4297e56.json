After the trade, I would have 1 'G' and 4 'R'. Since I need 1 'G' and 1 'R' for the path, giving away 1 'G' for 1 'R' doesn't directly help as I still have enough 'R' and will be left with just enough 'G'. However, having an extra 'R' could be beneficial if my path changes or if I consider alternative paths. Still, my primary path doesn't strictly require this trade for completion.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
