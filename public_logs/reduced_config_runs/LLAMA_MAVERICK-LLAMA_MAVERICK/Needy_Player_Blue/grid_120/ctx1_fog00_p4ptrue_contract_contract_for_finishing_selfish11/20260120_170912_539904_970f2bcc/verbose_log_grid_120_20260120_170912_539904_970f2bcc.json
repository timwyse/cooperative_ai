Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You will have 1 less 'R' chip effectively because you're covering for them, but you have 14 'R' chips.\n\nIf they help you by covering 'G': 0 (since you have enough 'G' for your path), there's no direct benefit to you since you already have sufficient 'G' chips for your preferred path.\n\nHowever, a mutually beneficial trade could be proposed where you both help each other. You could offer to cover 'R': 1 for them in exchange for them covering 'B': 0 or another color you need (but you don't need 'B' for your chosen path).\n\nSince you have enough chips for your path and don't strictly need their help, the proposal should be framed in a way that benefits you. However, helping them could potentially lead to a reciprocal benefit in the form of points as per the contract.\n\nLet's propose a contract: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\" This is a starting point. Given that you don't need their chips for your preferred path, you're not strictly benefiting from a trade unless it guarantees you a significant advantage or points.\n\nHowever, since they lack 'R' chips and you have them in abundance, a more reasonable approach might be to negotiate based on the value of helping them reach their goal.\n\nA more balanced proposal considering the mutual benefit could be: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\" But given the rules, let's directly propose something that could be beneficial or at least start the negotiation.\n\nLet's start with: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\" This is because you don't need their help to reach your goal, so you're not inclined to give them many points. \n\nLet's see their response.\n\n**Proposal**: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\""

Your proposal doesn't directly benefit them in terms of points if they don't reach their goal. However, if they accept your proposal, they stand to gain 0 points if you reach your goal (which is likely since you have enough chips) and lose 10 points if they reach their goal.\n\nA likely counter-proposal from them could involve asking for more points if they reach their goal or demanding a more balanced distribution considering the help they need from you.\n\nLet's anticipate they might not accept such a one-sided proposal and might counter with something like: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points. If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points,\" where Y is significantly more than 10, or X is less than 10 but still a considerable amount.\n\nSince you have enough chips and your primary path doesn't require their help, you're in a relatively stronger position. However, you can still propose a slightly more generous deal to come to an agreement.\n\nLet's counter their non-existent counter-proposal with a slightly adjusted offer.\n\n**Counter-Proposal**: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points.\" \n\nThis is still somewhat in your favor but shows a willingness to negotiate and provide some points to them if they reach their goal, likely because they help you indirectly or as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nEnd of message.

Your proposal doesn't directly benefit them in terms of points if they don't reach their goal. However, if they accept your proposal, they stand to gain 0 points if you reach your goal (which is likely since you have enough chips) and lose 10 points if they reach their goal.\n\nA likely counter-proposal from them could involve asking for more points if they reach their goal or demanding a more balanced distribution considering the help they need from you.\n\nLet's anticipate they might not accept such a one-sided proposal and might counter with something like: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points. If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points,\" where Y is significantly more than 10, or X is less than 10 but still a considerable amount.\n\nSince you have enough chips and your primary path doesn't require their help, you're in a relatively stronger position. However, you can still propose a slightly more generous deal to come to an agreement.\n\nLet's counter their non-existent counter-proposal with a slightly adjusted offer.\n\n**Counter-Proposal**: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points.\" \n\nThis is still somewhat in your favor but shows a willingness to negotiate and provide some points to them if they reach their goal, likely because they help you indirectly or as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nEnd of message.

If you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points,\" or something similar.\n\nGiven that you still have the upper hand in terms of not needing their chips for your path, but are willing to help, you could consider their counter-proposal.\n\nLet's directly propose a trade agreement related to the chip exchange instead of just points, which could be more mutually beneficial.\n\n**Counter-Proposal**: \"I can cover 'R': 1 for you if you cover 'G': 1 for me, and we agree on the points distribution as follows: If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 5 points.\"\n\nThis way, you're directly benefiting from the trade by getting 'G': 1, which you can potentially use to extend your path or have as surplus, and they're getting 'R': 1, which they need.\n\nHowever, since your initial path doesn't require 'G': 1 from them (you already have it), let's directly adjust our strategy to a chip trade or a simple points agreement that reflects the reality of the situation.\n\nLet's directly **accept a simple points agreement**.\n\n**Counter-Proposal**: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 4 points.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 5}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 5}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
