The proposed trade involves giving away 2 red chips in exchange for 2 blue chips. I currently have 12 red chips and only need 3 for my path, so giving away 2 is not a problem. However, I already have 1 blue chip and only need 1 more for my path. Gaining 2 blue chips means I'll have 2 extra blue chips after the trade. This trade is beneficial as it doesn't hinder my ability to reach the goal and results in having more chips leftover. Since the goal is the same for both players and I have more red chips than needed while the other player has more blue chips than needed, this trade is mutually beneficial in theory. However, my primary concern is my own score. The trade results in me having {'B': 3, 'G': 2, 'R': 10} after the trade. I still have enough chips to reach my goal and now have extra blue chips. Thus, accepting this trade will not hinder my path and will leave me with more chips, potentially resulting in a higher score."
