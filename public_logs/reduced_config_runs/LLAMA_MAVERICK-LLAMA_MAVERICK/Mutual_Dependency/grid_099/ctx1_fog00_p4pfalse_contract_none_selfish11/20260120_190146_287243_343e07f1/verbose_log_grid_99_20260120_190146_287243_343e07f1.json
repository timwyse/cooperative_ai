However, having extra 'R' chips could be beneficial if I need to adjust my path or if it leads to a more optimal path. Currently, I don't need more 'R' chips for my planned path, and giving up 'G' chips could potentially hinder my ability to take this path if I were to use more 'G' chips than anticipated.
