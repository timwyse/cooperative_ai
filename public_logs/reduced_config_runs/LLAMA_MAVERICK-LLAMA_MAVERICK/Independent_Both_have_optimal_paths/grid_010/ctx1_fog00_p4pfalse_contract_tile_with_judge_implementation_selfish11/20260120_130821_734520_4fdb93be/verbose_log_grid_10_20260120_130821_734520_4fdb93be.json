What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: To determine a suitable proposal, let's first analyze the given information.\n\nMy goal is at (3, 3), and I start at (0, 0). I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} chips. A path to my goal that prioritizes using chips I have is [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], requiring {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips. \n\nThe other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} chips. To reach my goal, I am missing 'B' chips, as seen in the alternative path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nLet's examine the path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] more closely, as it requires chips the other player has. The steps involve moving through tiles with the following colors: B (1,0), B (2,0), R (2,1), B (3,1), R (3,2). \n\nTo follow this path, I need 'B' chips at (1,0), (2,0), (3,1) and I have enough 'G' and 'R' for the rest of the path.\n\nHere's a proposal based on the required 'B' chips for the path:\n- At (1,0), I need 1 'B' chip. You give me 1 'B' at (1,0), I give you nothing.\n- At (2,0), I need 1 'B' chip. You give me 1 'B' at (2,0), I give you nothing.\n- At (3,1), I need 1 'B' chip. You give me 1 'B' at (3,1), I give you nothing.\n\nHowever, to make it beneficial for both, I should offer something in return. Since the other player needs 'R' chips and I have them, I can propose a trade involving 'R'. \n\nLet's adjust the proposal to include a beneficial trade for both:\n- At (1,0), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n- At (2,0), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n- At (3,1), You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n\nThis proposal seems fair as it involves giving the other player 'R' chips they need (since they have 'R': 0), in exchange for 'B' chips.\n\nHere's the proposal message:\n\n\"(1,0): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(2,0): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(3,1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\"\n\nLet's see their response. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let's negotiate a contract.\n\nTo follow the path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], I need 'B' chips at (1,0), (2,0), and (3,1). I propose the following contract:\n\n(1,0): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(2,0): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(3,1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n\nThis way, I get the 'B' chips I need, and you get 'R' chips you lack. Let's discuss this proposal. \n, \nplayer 0: To evaluate the proposal, let's analyze the terms.\n\nThe proposed contract is for the path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires me to give you 'B' chips and you give me 'R' chips at (1,0), (2,0), and (3,1).\n\nThe path requires {'B': 3, 'G': 1, 'R': 2} chips in total. With the proposed contract, I will get the 'B' chips needed, and you'll get 'R' chips. \n\nLet's count the chips:\n- You have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}.\n- I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}.\n\nAfter the trade:\n- You will have {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 3}.\n- I will have {'B': 3, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}.\n\nThen, I will move according to the path, using the chips I have and the ones I'll get from the contract.\n\nAt the end of the path, I will have:\n- Used {'R': 2 + 2 (for (2,1) and (3,2)) = 4, 'G': 1, 'B': 3} chips.\n- Remaining chips: {'R': 10, 'G': 1, 'B': 0}.\n\nMy score will be 20 (for reaching the goal) + 5 * (10 + 1) = 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nWithout the contract, I wouldn't be able to follow this path and reach the goal with a good score.\n\nThe proposal seems reasonable. I accept it.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Since you have accepted the proposal, I will formalize it and confirm that we have a contract.\n\nThe proposed contract was:\n\"(1,0): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(2,0): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\n(3,1): You give me 1 'B', I give you 1 'R'.\"\n\nLet's confirm this in the required format.\n\nThe contract is agreed upon, and I will now end my message with the confirmation word.\n\nagree \n",

However, my next move is to (3, 2), which requires a 'B' chip. I don't have the 'B' chip needed for (3, 2), and there's no contract term to provide it.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
