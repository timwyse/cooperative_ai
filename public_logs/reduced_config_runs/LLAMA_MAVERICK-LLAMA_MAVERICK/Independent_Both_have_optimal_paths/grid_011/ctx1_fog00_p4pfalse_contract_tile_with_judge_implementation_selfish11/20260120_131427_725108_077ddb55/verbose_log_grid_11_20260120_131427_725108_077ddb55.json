What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: To determine a mutually beneficial contract, let's first analyze the given information and potential paths to the goal.\n\nThe goal is at (3, 3), and we are currently at (0, 0). One potential path to the goal that prioritizes using chips we have is: \n(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3). \nThis path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nAnother path that prioritizes using chips the other player has is: \n(0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3). \nThis path requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nSince we have 'R' chips and the other player has 'B' chips, a mutually beneficial trade seems possible. \n\nLet's examine the second path: \n1. (0, 0) -> (0, 1): We need 'B' at (0, 1).\n2. (0, 1) -> (0, 2): We need 'B' at (0, 2).\n3. (0, 2) -> (0, 3): We need 'B' at (0, 3).\n4. (1, 3) -> (2, 3): We need 'B' at (2, 3).\n\nWe need 'B' chips at (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (2, 3). The other player has 'B' chips.\n\nLet's propose a contract:\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\n\nIn return, we need to give the other player 'R' chips because they don't have any. One of the paths they might take could require 'R' chips. Let's consider their situation.\n\nThe other player's chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. A potential path for them could be:\n(0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3), \nwhich requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}.\n\nFor (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), they need 'R'. So, we can offer 'R' chips in return.\n\nLet's propose:\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): I give you a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): I give you a 'R'\n\nThis proposal seems reasonable as both parties benefit. What do you think? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let's analyze your proposal and provide a potential counter-proposal or acceptance.\n\nYou proposed:\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): I give you a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): I give you a 'R'\n\nThis proposal is close, but let's verify if it's beneficial for both parties.\n\n1. You need 'B' at (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), and (2, 3). You have 'B': 14 initially and need 4 'B' chips, so you'll have 10 'B' chips left. \n2. The other player needs 'R' at (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), and (3, 2). They have 'R': 0 initially and will get 4 'R' chips.\n\nLet's check if this trade is beneficial for me. \n- I will give 4 'R' chips, and I initially have 'R': 0. So, I need to have at least 4 'R' chips to give. However, I don't have 'R' chips initially, but I can plan my path to accumulate 'R' chips or assess if the trade is still beneficial.\n\nHowever, there is an issue. The path you proposed for me requires 'R': 5 and 'G': 1. But I'm only getting 4 'R' chips from you. So, I'll still be short of 1 'R' chip.\n\nLet's modify the proposal:\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): I give you a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): I give you a 'R'\nAt (1, 1): I give you a 'R'  (additional 'R' chip)\n\nWith this modification, I'll get the 5 'R' chips I need.\n\nHere's the counter-proposal:\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): I give you a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): I give you a 'R'\nAt (1, 2): Not needed, let's use (1, 1): I give you a 'R'\n\nLet's simplify it to:\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): I give you a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (1, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): I give you a 'R'\n\nagree is not used here as we are still negotiating.\n\nLet's see your response. \n, \nplayer 0: Let's analyze your counter-proposal.\n\nYou suggested:\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): I give you a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (1, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): I give you a 'R'\n\nThis proposal is mostly acceptable. Let's verify the details.\n\n1. You'll give me 4 'B' chips, which I need for my path.\n2. I'll give you 5 'R' chips, which you'll need for your path.\n\nLet's check the chip counts:\n- I'll give away 5 'R' chips. I initially have 14 'R' chips, so I'll be left with 14 - 5 = 9 'R' chips.\n- You'll give away 4 'B' chips. You initially have 14 'B' chips, so you'll be left with 14 - 4 = 10 'B' chips.\n\nBoth of us will have enough chips for our respective paths.\n\nSince this proposal is beneficial for both parties and covers the required chips, I accept the counter-proposal.\n\nAt (0, 1): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): You give me a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): You give me a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): I give you a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (1, 1): I give you a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): I give you a 'R'\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: At (0, 1): I give you a 'B'\nAt (0, 2): I give you a 'B'\nAt (0, 3): I give you a 'B'\nAt (2, 3): I give you a 'B'\nAt (1, 0): You give me a 'R'\nAt (2, 1): You give me a 'R'\nAt (3, 1): You give me a 'R'\nAt (1, 1): You give me a 'R'\nAt (3, 2): You give me a 'R'\n\nagree \n",

However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"
