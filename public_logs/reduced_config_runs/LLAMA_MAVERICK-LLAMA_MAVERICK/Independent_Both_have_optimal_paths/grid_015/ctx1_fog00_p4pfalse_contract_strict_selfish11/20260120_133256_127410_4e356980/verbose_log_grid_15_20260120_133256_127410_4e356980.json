This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} chips, so they can provide 'B' chips.\n\nLet's examine a potential path that requires 'B' chips: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], which requires {'B': 5, 'G': 1} chips. I need 'B' chips for this path.\n\nTo follow this path, I need 'B' chips at (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). I have enough 'G' chips but need to acquire 'B' chips.\n\nHere's a proposal:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 3): You give me a B\n(2, 3): You give me a B\n\nIn return, I can offer 'R' or 'G' chips because I have them. Since the other player doesn't have 'R' chips, I can propose giving them 'R' or 'G' chips. Let's give 'R' chips as they are more abundant with me.\n\nHere's a counter-value for the 'B' chips:\n\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(1, 0 is on my path and requires an 'R' chip, which I have, so I can give one 'R' chip as a counter-value).\n\nHowever, giving just one 'R' chip for five 'B' chips might not be a fair trade. Let's consider giving more 'R' chips or using 'G' chips.\n\nLet's propose the following:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 3): You give me a B\n(2, 3): You give me a B\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 1): I give you a R\n\nThis seems like a more balanced trade.

Let's consider giving more 'R' chips or using 'G' chips.\n\nLet's propose the following:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 3): You give me a B\n(2, 3): You give me a B\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 1): I give you a R\n\nThis seems like a more balanced trade.

After the trade, I'll have {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 2} chips.\n\nTo determine if this trade is beneficial for me, let's examine my potential path and the chips I'll need. A path that prioritizes using my chips is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips. However, I lack 'R' chips.\n\nWith the proposed trade, I'll gain 2 'R' chips, but I'll still be short of 'R' chips. I need 5 'R' chips, and I'll have 2 after the trade.\n\nTo make a more informed decision, I'll propose a counter-trade that benefits both of us.\n\nLet's modify the contract to:\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 3): You give me a B\n(2, 3): You give me a B\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(1, 1): I give you a R\n(2, 1): I give you a R\n\nThis revised contract gives me 3 'R' chips, making it more feasible for me to reach my goal.\n\nHowever, I can propose an alternative:\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 3): You give me a B\n(2, 3): You give me a B\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 0): I give you a R\n(3, 1): I give you a R\n\nLet's see if this is more acceptable.\n\nCounter-proposal:\n(0, 1): You give me a B\n(0, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 2): You give me a B\n(1, 3): You give me a B\n(2, 3): You give me a B\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 0): I give you a R\n(3, 1): I give you a R\n\nYour turn."

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
