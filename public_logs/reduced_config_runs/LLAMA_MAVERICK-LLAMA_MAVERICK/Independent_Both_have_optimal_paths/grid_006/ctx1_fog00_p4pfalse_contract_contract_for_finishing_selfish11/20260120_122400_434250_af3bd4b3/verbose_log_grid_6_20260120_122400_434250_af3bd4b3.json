A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (2, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (0, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 1), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\nMOVE: You did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 1), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: The other player did not move\nMOVE: You did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 1), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
