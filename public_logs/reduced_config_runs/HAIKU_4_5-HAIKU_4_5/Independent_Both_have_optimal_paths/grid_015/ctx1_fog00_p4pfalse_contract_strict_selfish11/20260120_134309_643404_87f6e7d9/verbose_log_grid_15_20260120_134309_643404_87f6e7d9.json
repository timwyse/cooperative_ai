Uses a chip color I have in abundance\n3. Leaves me with 9 B and 2 G chips, which is exactly what I need for the final move to (3,3) where the tile is Green\n\nThis is optimal because:\n- It's the shortest path available\n- I have all required chips\n- After this move, I'll have exactly 1 Green chip left to complete the final step to (3,3)\n- I'll finish with 9 remaining Blue chips, giving me a final score of 20 + 5*9 = 65 points\n\nLet me move to (2,3).",
