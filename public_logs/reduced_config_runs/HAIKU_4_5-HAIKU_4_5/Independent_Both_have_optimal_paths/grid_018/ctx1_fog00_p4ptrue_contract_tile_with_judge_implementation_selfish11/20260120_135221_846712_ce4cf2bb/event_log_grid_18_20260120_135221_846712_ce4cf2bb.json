What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let me analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**My current position:** (0, 0)\n**My goal:** (3, 3)\n**My chips:** R: 14, G: 2, B: 0\n**Other player's chips:** B: 14, G: 2, R: 0\n\n**Analyzing my best path:**\n\nPath prioritizing my chips: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R tile - I have R chips ✓\n- (2,0): R tile - I have R chips ✓\n- (3,0): R tile - I have R chips ✓\n- (3,1): R tile - I have R chips ✓\n- (3,2): R tile - I have R chips ✓\n- (3,3): G tile - I have G chips ✓\n\nThis path requires 5 R chips and 1 G chip. I have exactly this! I can reach the goal without any trade at all.\n\nHowever, let me consider if trading could benefit me:\n\nThe other path uses B chips (which I don't have), so if I want that path, I'd need to trade. But my current path works perfectly with what I have.\n\n**My strategy:** Since I can reach my goal with my current inventory without needing to trade, I should propose a contract that is beneficial to me while being acceptable to the other player. However, I need to be careful - any trade that weakens my position is not worth it.\n\nLet me propose a simple, fair contract:\n\n---\n\n**I propose the following contract:**\n\nSince I can reach the goal with my current chip inventory via the red tiles on the left side of the board, and you have excess Blue chips, I suggest:\n\n**(3,3): I give you a G**\n**(1,2): You give me a B** (as a backup option if needed)\n**(1,3): You give me a B** (as a backup option if needed)\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since I don't actually need this trade to win, and you also need to reach (3,3), let me propose something more neutral:\n\n**I propose no trade is necessary for me.** I can complete my goal using my R and G chips via the path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3), requiring only chips I already possess.\n\nHowever, if you'd like to negotiate a mutually beneficial arrangement where we don't interfere with each other's optimal paths, I'm open to discussion.\n\nWhat is your proposed path to the goal, and do you need my assistance? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I appreciate your analysis, but let me reconsider this more carefully as a selfish agent focused solely on maximizing my own score.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0\n- Other player has: R: 14, G: 2, B: 0\n- My goal: (3, 3)\n- Their goal: (3, 3)\n\n**My viable paths:**\n\n1. **Path using my B chips:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n   - Costs: B at (0,1), B at (0,2), B at (1,2), B at (1,3), B at (2,3), G at (3,3)\n   - Total: 5 B chips + 1 G chip = 6 chips spent\n   - **Remaining chips: 9 B + 1 G = 10 chips → Score: 20 + 50 = 70 points**\n\n2. **Path using their R chips (requires trade):** (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n   - Costs: R at (1,0), R at (2,0), R at (3,0), R at (3,1), R at (3,2), G at (3,3)\n   - Total: 5 R chips (their cost) + 1 G chip = 6 moves\n   - **If they cover the 5 R tiles, I spend only 1 G chip**\n   - **Remaining chips: 14 B + 1 G = 15 chips → Score: 20 + 75 = 95 points**\n\n**The self-interested play:** I should trade with the other player to use their R chips, as this leaves me with MORE chips (15 vs 10), giving me a higher final score (95 vs 70).\n\n---\n\n**My proposal:**\n\nI propose the following contract to maximize my chips remaining:\n\n**(1,0): You give me an R**\n**(2,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,1): You give me an R**\n**(3,2): You give me an R**\n\nIn exchange:\n**(0,1): I give you a B**\n**(0,2): I give you a B**\n\nThis gives you enough B chips to take an alternative path while I take the R-heavy path using your chips. You'll have B coverage for your route, and I'll conserve my B chips while reaching the goal.\n\nWhat do you think of this arrangement? \n, \nplayer 0: I need to carefully analyze this proposal from a **selfish perspective focused on my own score**.\n\nLet me think through the other player's offer:\n\n**Their proposal:**\n- They want me to cover 5 R tiles: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n- They offer to cover 2 B tiles: (0,1), (0,2)\n\n**Evaluating this for ME:**\n\nMy original analysis showed:\n- **Path using my B chips:** 5 B + 1 G required → leaves me with 9 B + 1 G = **10 chips → 70 points**\n- **Path using their R chips:** 5 R (covered by them) + 1 G → leaves me with 14 B + 1 G = **15 chips → 95 points**\n\n**But wait - let me check what they're actually asking:**\n\nIf I commit 5 R chips to cover their path, I'm giving away chips I need for MY path. Let me reconsider their path requirements:\n\nTheir path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) needs:\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B  \n- (1,2): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (2,3): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nThey're only asking me to cover (0,1) and (0,2) - just 2 B tiles, but they only have 2 G and 14 B total.\n\n**Critical realization:** If I give them 2 B chips for coverage, but I also need 5 R chips from them, I'm trading away 5 of my R chips permanently to cover their movement. But I have 14 R chips available - I can afford this!\n\nHowever, they're only asking for 2 B tiles to be covered, not all 5 B tiles they need. This means:\n- They'll use their own B chips for (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)\n- I cover (0,1), (0,2)\n- They cover my 5 R tiles\n\n**For me:** I end with 14 B - 2 B (promised) = 12 B remaining, plus 1 G = **13 chips → 65 points**\n\nThat's WORSE than going my own path (70 points)!\n\n---\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\nThis deal doesn't benefit me enough. I should instead propose:\n\n**(1,0): You give me an R**\n**(2,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,1): You give me an R**\n**(3,2): You give me an R**\n\nIn exchange:\n**(0,1): I give you a B**\n**(0,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,3): I give you a B**\n**(2,3): I give you a B**\n\nThis way, you have FULL coverage of your B-tile path, leaving you with maximum chips, while I use your R chips and keep 9 B + 1 G = 10 chips remaining.\n\n**Actually, that still leaves me with 70 points - the same as not trading.**\n\nLet me reconsider: **Should I trade at all?** The issue is that by covering their tiles, I'm not gaining anything beyond my baseline path. The optimal selfish play is:\n\n**I will not accept this offer. Instead, I propose we each take our natural paths without trading, since:**\n- I can reach (3,3) with my B chips\n- You can reach (3,3) with your R chips\n- Neither of us needs to compromise\n\nHowever, if you insist on a trade that genuinely benefits me, propose something that leaves me with **more than 10 remaining chips**. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I need to think through this very carefully as a selfish agent.\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0\n- Other player has: R: 14, G: 2, B: 0\n- Goal: (3, 3)\n\n**Path Analysis:**\n\n**Option 1: My natural path (B-heavy)**\nRoute: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Chips needed: 5 B + 1 G\n- Chips remaining: 9 B + 1 G = **10 chips → Score: 20 + 50 = 70 points**\n\n**Option 2: Using other player's R chips**\nRoute: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Chips needed: 5 R (from them) + 1 G (mine)\n- If they cover all 5 R tiles, I spend only 1 G\n- Chips remaining: 14 B + 1 G = **15 chips → Score: 20 + 75 = 95 points**\n\n**The critical insight:** The other player is proposing I cover only 2 B tiles for them. But they NEED 5 B tiles for their path. This means:\n- If I only cover (0,1) and (0,2), they still need to cover (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) themselves\n- I'd be giving up 5 R chips to them but only getting coverage for 2 of my B tiles\n- This is a terrible deal for me\n\n**What I should propose instead:**\n\nTo truly maximize my score, I need the other player to cover ALL 5 R tiles on my preferred path. In exchange, I should cover EXACTLY what they need - their 5 B tiles.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n**(1,0): You give me an R**\n**(2,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,1): You give me an R**\n**(3,2): You give me an R**\n\nIn exchange, I will cover your B-heavy path:\n**(0,1): I give you a B**\n**(0,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,3): I give you a B**\n**(2,3): I give you a B**\n\nThis way:\n- **You** take route (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), with me covering all B costs\n- **I** take route (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), with you covering all R costs\n- I end with: 9 B + 1 G = 10 chips remaining... wait, that's the same as my baseline!\n\n**Realization:** Both paths cost exactly 6 chips total. The only advantage of trading is if I can make the OTHER player pay for MORE tiles than they would naturally need.\n\nBut that's impossible if they're rational - they won't accept a deal worse than their natural path.\n\n**Therefore, my actual selfish response is:**\n\nI should take my natural B-heavy path without trading. This guarantees me 70 points with no risk of the trade falling through.\n\nHowever, since the other player proposed first, let me respond strategically:\n\n---\n\nYour proposal only covers 2 of my B tiles but asks me to cover all 5 of your R tiles. This is unfair to me. \n\n**I counter-propose:** A symmetric exchange where you cover ALL 5 R tiles on my preferred route, and I cover ALL 5 B tiles on your preferred route:\n\n**(1,0): You give me an R**\n**(2,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,0): You \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely right - let me think through this more carefully as a selfish agent.\n\n**Critical realization:** Both of our natural paths cost exactly 6 chips (5 of one color + 1 G). This means:\n- My B-path leaves me with 9 B + 1 G = 10 chips → **70 points**\n- The R-path also leaves me with the same amount if I trade equally\n\n**There is no mutual benefit here.** Any symmetric trade where we each take the other player's naturally available path results in the same final score for me (70 points).\n\n**However, there IS a critical asymmetry I should exploit:**\n\nThe other player made a proposal asking me to cover only 2 of their B tiles while they cover my 5 R tiles. This is actually advantageous to THEM, not me. If I reject this and counter with \"full coverage both ways,\" we're back to square one where neither of us gains.\n\n**The truly selfish move:** I should just take my natural B-heavy path without trading at all, guaranteeing myself 70 points with zero risk of negotiation failure.\n\n---\n\n**My response:**\n\nAfter careful analysis, I realize that any trade where we both take mutually beneficial paths results in identical final scores for me compared to just taking my natural route. Since I can guarantee myself 70 points by simply using my B chips without trading, I'm going to do that.\n\n**I do not accept your proposal.**\n\nI will proceed with my natural path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires only chips I already possess (5 B + 1 G), guaranteeing my goal completion with 10 remaining chips and a score of 70 points, with no reliance on your cooperation.\n\nIf you wish to reach your goal, take your natural R-path. We can both win without trading. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: You're right to be cautious, but let me reconsider this from a purely selfish optimization standpoint one more time.\n\n**Wait - I need to check something critical:**\n\nLooking at the board again and both our positions at (0,0) going to (3,3):\n\n**My natural B-path:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Costs: B, B, B, B, B, G = 5 B + 1 G spent\n- **Remaining: 9 B + 1 G = 10 chips → 70 points**\n\n**Alternative: Their R-path with full trade:**\nIf I take (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Costs: R, R, R, R, R, G = 5 R + 1 G\n- If they cover all 5 R tiles, I only spend 1 G chip\n- **Remaining: 14 B + 1 G = 15 chips → 95 points**\n\n**The math is clear:** Taking the R-path with full trade coverage gives me 95 points vs 70 points. That's a 25-point difference!\n\n**But here's my concern:** The other player already proposed an *asymmetric* deal (only 2 B tiles for 5 R tiles). They're clearly trying to get a better outcome for themselves. Why would they agree to cover all 5 R tiles?\n\n**Actually - that's not my problem.** I should propose what's best for me. If they reject it, I fall back to my guaranteed 70-point B-path. But I should absolutely push for the 95-point outcome.\n\n---\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\nI will only agree to a trade that gives me maximum remaining chips. Here's what I require:\n\n**(1,0): You give me an R**\n**(2,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,1): You give me an R**\n**(3,2): You give me an R**\n\nIn exchange:\n**(0,1): I give you a B**\n**(0,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,3): I give you a B**\n**(2,3): I give you a B**\n\nThis is a fair symmetric trade where we both take the other's natural path. You get your goal with my B coverage (9 B left for you + your 2 G = 11 chips for 75 points), and I get my goal with your R coverage (9 B left for me + 1 G = 10 chips for 70 points).\n\nActually wait - that still leaves me with 70 points, same as my B-path.\n\n**I need to think about whether there's ANY scenario where trading improves my position beyond 70 points...**\n\nActually, the answer is no. Any trade requires me to either:\n1. Give up B chips I need, OR\n2. Give up G chips I need\n\nThe ONLY way to improve beyond 70 is if the other player covers more tiles than their own path requires. But why would a rational player do that?\n\n**Final decision: I decline trading and take my guaranteed B-path for 70 points.**\n\nI will not accept your proposal. I'm taking my natural path using only my own chips. \n, \nplayer 0: You're right - let me think through this one final time with complete clarity.\n\n**The fundamental math:**\n\nMy B-path: 5 B + 1 G spent → 9 B + 1 G remain = **10 chips → 70 points**\n\nTheir R-path with trade: 5 R (covered by them) + 1 G spent → 14 B + 1 G remain = **15 chips → 95 points**\n\n**The core question:** Why would the other player agree to cover all 5 of my R tiles if we're both selfish agents?\n\nLet me check THEIR situation:\n- If they take their B-path naturally: 5 B + 1 G spent → 9 B + 1 G remain = **10 chips → 70 points**\n- If they take the R-path with full trade: 5 R (not spent) + 1 G spent → 14 R + 1 G remain = **15 chips → 95 points**\n\n**Aha!** The other player is in the EXACT same position as me. They also benefit massively from taking the R-path instead of their natural B-path. So a symmetric trade is actually GOOD for both of us - we both get 95 points instead of 70!\n\nThis means:\n- **Both players taking their natural paths:** Each gets 70 points (no trade)\n- **Both players taking the other's path (full trade):** Each gets 95 points (mutual benefit!)\n\nA symmetric trade where we each cover the other's natural-path tiles actually benefits BOTH of us. This is mutually beneficial cooperation that increases MY score from 70 to 95 - a massive gain!\n\n---\n\n**I should accept the symmetric trade:**\n\n**(1,0): You give me an R**\n**(2,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,1): You give me an R**\n**(3,2): You give me an R**\n\n**(0,1): I give you a B**\n**(0,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,2): I give you a B**\n**(1,3): I give you a B**\n**(2,3): I give you a B**\n\nThis gives me 95 points instead of 70 - a 25 point improvement. From a purely selfish perspective, this is exactly what I should do.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: **WAIT - I need to reconsider what the other player actually proposed.**\n\nLooking back at their Turn 1 proposal, they said:\n\n**(1,0): You give me an R**\n**(2,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,0): You give me an R**\n**(3,1): You give me an R**\n**(3,2): You give me an R**\n\nIn exchange:\n**(0,1): I give you a B**\n**(0,2): I give you a B**\n\n**This is NOT symmetric.** They're asking me to cover 5 R tiles but only offering to cover 2 B tiles. They're NOT covering tiles (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3).\n\nThis means if I accept their proposal:\n- I use the R-path but only get coverage for 5 R tiles ✓\n- They use the B-path but only get coverage for 2 B tiles\n- They still need to pay for (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) themselves\n\n**For me:** I'd take R-path (5 R covered by them + 1 G mine) = 14 B + 1 G = 95 points ✓\n\n**For them:** They'd take B-path needing 5 B total, but I only cover 2, so they pay 3 themselves = 14 R + 2 G - 3 B = they lose chips but still reach goal\n\n**This is asymmetric in THEIR favor,** not mine. They're getting me to cover my full path while they only partially cover mine.\n\nActually no - I'm reading this wrong. Let me re-read their proposal:\n\nThey want:\n- 5 R tiles covered (by them giving me R)\n- In exchange: 2 B tiles covered (by me giving them B)\n\nSo they're ASKING me to give them B coverage at (0,1) and (0,2), while they GIVE me R at those 5 tiles.\n\n**I should only accept if the trade is symmetric:** All 5 B tiles covered for all 5 R tiles covered.\n\nSince their proposal is asymmetric and less favorable to me, I should reject it and stick with my plan to not trade at all, taking my B-path for a guaranteed 70 points.\n\n**My actual response:**\n\nI reject your proposal. It's asymmetric - you're only offering to cover 2 of my B tiles while asking me to cover 5 of your R tiles. \n\nIf you want my cooperation, you must cover all 5 B tiles on my natural path:\n\n**(0,1): You give me a B**\n**(0,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,3): You give me a B**\n**(2,3): You give me a B**\n\n**(1,0): I give you an R**\n**(2,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,1): I give you an R**\n**(3,2): I give you an R**\n\nOtherwise, I proceed alone with my B-path for 70 points. \n, \nplayer 0: Actually, let me reconsider what just happened in Turn 3.\n\n**Looking back at the conversation:**\n\nIn Turn 3, the other player said they were reconsidering and then presented the SAME asymmetric proposal from Turn 1 (only 2 B tiles covered). They didn't actually present a new counter-offer to my rejection.\n\nThen I said \"agree\" - but I was agreeing to a SYMMETRIC trade that neither player had actually formally proposed yet. I was extrapolating what I thought was fair.\n\n**The problem:** The other player never agreed to cover all 5 B tiles. Their last actual proposal was still only 2 B tiles.\n\nLet me trace through what was actually said:\n- Turn 1: Other player proposed (5 R covered by them) + (2 B covered by me)\n- Turn 2: I rejected and counter-proposed symmetric trade\n- Turn 3: Other player re-examined their original proposal but didn't formally accept my symmetric counter\n- I then said \"agree\" but there was no clear bilateral agreement reached\n\n**For clarity and to protect my interests:**\n\nI need to confirm: Are you agreeing to cover ALL 5 of my B tiles at (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3)?\n\nIf yes, then I agree to the symmetric trade and we can proceed.\n\nIf you're still proposing only 2 B tiles, then I reject and will take my natural B-path alone for my guaranteed 70 points.\n\nWhat is your final position? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 5: You're absolutely right to demand clarity. Let me be direct about what just happened.\n\n**What I said in Turn 3 was premature.** I said \"agree\" but:\n1. You never formally accepted my symmetric counter-proposal\n2. Your last actual offer was still the asymmetric one (5 R for only 2 B)\n3. I jumped to \"agree\" without getting bilateral confirmation\n\n**I need to clarify the actual contract before proceeding:**\n\nAre you agreeing to the **symmetric trade** where:\n- You cover ALL 5 B tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3)\n- I cover ALL 5 R tiles: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n**OR** are you still proposing the **asymmetric trade** where:\n- You cover only 2 B tiles: (0,1), (0,2)\n- I cover all 5 R tiles: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n**If it's the asymmetric version:** I reject it. That leaves me worse off than taking my natural B-path alone (70 points guaranteed).\n\n**If it's the symmetric version:** I accept it immediately, as it gives both of us 95 points instead of 70.\n\nThis is Turn 4 of 5, so we need to resolve this now. Which is it? \n, \nplayer 0: You're right to demand clarity before the final turn ends.\n\n**My position is clear:**\n\nI will **only accept the symmetric trade**:\n\n**(0,1): You give me a B**\n**(0,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,3): You give me a B**\n**(2,3): You give me a B**\n\n**(1,0): I give you an R**\n**(2,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,1): I give you an R**\n**(3,2): I give you an R**\n\n**Rationale:** This gives me 95 points (9 B + 1 G remaining) instead of my guaranteed 70 points with my natural B-path. It's worth 25 extra points, and it's mutually beneficial to both of us.\n\n**I will NOT accept** your original asymmetric proposal (5 R for only 2 B), as that leaves me with only 70 points anyway - the same as not trading - while you benefit more. That's irrational for a selfish agent.\n\n**Your decision:** Do you agree to cover all 5 B tiles so we both get 95 points?\n\nIf yes: **agree**\n\nIf no: I proceed alone with my B-path for 70 guaranteed points, and you should do the same with your R-path for 70 points.\n\nWhat is your final answer? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 6: I appreciate you laying this out clearly, but I need to be absolutely honest about my position as a selfish agent.\n\n**Let me recalculate one final time:**\n\nIf I accept the symmetric trade:\n- I take path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You cover all 5 R tiles for me\n- I spend only 1 G chip\n- **I end with: 14 B + 1 G = 15 chips → 95 points**\n\nIf I reject and take my natural B-path alone:\n- I take path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- I spend 5 B + 1 G\n- **I end with: 9 B + 1 G = 10 chips → 70 points**\n\n**The math is undeniable: 95 > 70.**\n\nThe symmetric trade benefits me enormously. It also benefits you equally (you go from 70 to 95 as well). This is a genuinely mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\n**As a selfish agent focused purely on maximizing my own score, I should accept this.**\n\nMy commitment is firm and unambiguous:\n\n**(0,1): You give me a B**\n**(0,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,3): You give me a B**\n**(2,3): You give me a B**\n\n**(1,0): I give you an R**\n**(2,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,1): I give you an R**\n**(3,2): I give you an R**\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: Perfect. I'm satisfied with this contract and your commitment is clear.\n\n**Final Contract Summary:**\n\n**(0,1): You give me a B**\n**(0,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,2): You give me a B**\n**(1,3): You give me a B**\n**(2,3): You give me a B**\n\n**(1,0): I give you an R**\n**(2,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,0): I give you an R**\n**(3,1): I give you an R**\n**(3,2): I give you an R**\n\n**My execution plan:**\n- I will take the R-path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- You will cover my R costs at each of those 5 tiles\n- I will cover your B costs at each of those 5 tiles\n- I will spend only 1 of my own G chips at (3,3)\n- **Result: 14 B + 1 G remaining = 95 points**\n\n**Why this is rational for me:** As a selfish agent, this symmetric trade increases my score from 70 to 95 - a 25-point improvement over my natural path. The mutual benefit makes this the optimal selfish choice.\n\nI'm ready to proceed with this contract.\n\nagree \n",
