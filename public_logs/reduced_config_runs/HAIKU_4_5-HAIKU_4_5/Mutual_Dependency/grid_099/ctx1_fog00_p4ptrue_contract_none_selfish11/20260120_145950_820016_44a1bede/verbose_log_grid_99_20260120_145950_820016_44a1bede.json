My goal is at (3, 3).\n\nCurrent inventory: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\nOther player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}\nChips promised to me by other player: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\nChips I promised to cover: {'R': 0, 'B': 3, 'G': 0}\n\nAnalysis of available paths:\n1. Path via (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3): requires R,B,G,B = needs 1R (don't have) and 2B (have), 1G (have)\n2. Path via (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): requires R,R,B,G = needs 2R (other player promised 2R!) and 1B, 1G\n\nThe second path is perfect! I can move down to (3,0) which is a RED tile. I have been promised 2 R chips by the other player, so the other player will cover this move.\n\nNext move: (3,0) - this is RED, and the other player has promised to cover 2 R moves for me. This is the first of those covered moves.\n\nThis gets me closer to my goal on a path that uses the promised resources efficiently. After reaching (3,0), I can continue: (3,1) is R (second covered move), (3,2) is B (I have 12 B chips), and finally (3,3) is G (I have 2 G chips).\n\nThis path only requires the 2 R chips I've been promised, plus 1 B and 1 G from my inventory - very efficient!",
