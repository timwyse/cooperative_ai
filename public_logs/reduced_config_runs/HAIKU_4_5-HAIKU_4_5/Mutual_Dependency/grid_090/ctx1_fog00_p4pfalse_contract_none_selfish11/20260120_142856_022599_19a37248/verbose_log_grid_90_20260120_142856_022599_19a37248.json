Path that prioritizes my chips: (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) requires R:1, B:3, G:1. This is 5 steps and requires only chips I currently have.\n\n2. Shorter path suggested: (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) is only 4 steps but requires R:1, B:2, G:1. This is indeed shorter.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- From (1, 0), I can move to (2, 0) which is color R\n- I have R:1, so I can afford this move\n\nNext move planning:\n- Move to (2, 0) (costs 1 Red chip)\n- After this move, I'll be at (2, 0) with inventory: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- From (2, 0), I can continue to (3, 0) which is color R - but I'll be out of red chips!\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The shorter path (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) requires R:1, B:2, G:1 total. But I need to check each individual step:\n- (2, 0) is R (costs 1)\n- (2, 1) is R (costs 1) - but I only have 1 R total!\n\nSo the shorter path won't work without trading for more R chips.\n\nThe longer path from (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3):\n- (2, 0) is R (costs 1) ✓ I have this\n- (3, 0) is R (costs 1) - I don't have this!\n\nActually, looking at row 2: R R B B and row 3: B B B G\n\nLet me re-examine. From (1, 0) → (2, 0) requires paying for tile (2, 0). Looking at row 2: positions are (2,0)=R, (2,1)=R, (2,2)=B, (2,3)=B. So (2, 0) is Red, which I can pay.\n\nI should move to (2, 0) first as this gets me closer and is affordable. I have 12 Blue chips which should be sufficient for most of the remaining path once I figure out the exact sequence.",
