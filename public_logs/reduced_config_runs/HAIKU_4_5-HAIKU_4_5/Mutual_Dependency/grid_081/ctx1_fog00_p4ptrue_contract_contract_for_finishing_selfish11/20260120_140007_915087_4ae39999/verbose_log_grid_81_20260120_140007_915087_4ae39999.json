Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have the B chips I desperately need, and I have the R chips you need. Without cooperation, I cannot reach my goal at all (I'd get 0 points), but with your help on B chips, I can succeed.\n\n**My proposal:**\n\nI propose the following contract:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.**\n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 5 points.**\n\n**Reasoning:** \n- This heavily favors you because I'm in a much more desperate position - I literally cannot reach my goal without your B chips\n- If you help me cover 2 B chips, I can reach my goal and keep most of my chips (around 13 chips remaining = 20 + 65 = 85 base points, minus 15 given to you)\n- You get 15 points from me reaching my goal, plus you can use my R chips to help you succeed\n- This is asymmetric but reflects our different levels of dependency\n\nWhat do you think of this proposal?"

The chip trades are negotiated separately through the \"pay for other\" arrangement system.\n\nLet me reconsider the actual situation:\n\n**My analysis:**\n- I need R chips to reach my goal, and you have 14 of them\n- You need B chips, and I have 14 of them\n- Both of us can reach our goal (3,3) with cooperation, but neither of us can without it\n- The question is: what's a fair point split for a mutual assistance agreement?\n\n**However, I notice something important:** You're proposing to give me only 5 points if you reach your goal, while asking for 15 points if I reach mine. This seems heavily skewed in your favor given that we're in roughly symmetric positions - we both need the other's chips equally.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis is a fair, symmetric arrangement reflecting that:\n- We both depend on each other equally\n- We're both at risk if we don't cooperate\n- Each of us will end with a respectable score (20 base + chips remaining ≈ 50-70 points total)\n\nWhat do you think about this more balanced approach?"

In that sense, yes, we're equally dependent.\n\n**But here's where I see a slight advantage for me:**\n- Even if I cooperate minimally, I still end up with more chips remaining (I have 14 R vs your 2 G)\n- My path is more efficient chip-wise\n- I'm in a stronger bargaining position because without cooperation, both of us fail equally\n\n**However, your 10-10 proposal is fair.** In a symmetric mutual dependency situation where both parties lose everything without cooperation, a symmetric split makes sense.\n\n**I accept your counter-proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis is equitable given our mutual vulnerability.

Let me reconsider this properly.\n\n**Reassessing the actual situation:**\n\nYou've correctly identified that we're in roughly symmetric positions:\n- I need your B chips to survive (I have 0 B, need 2)\n- You need my R chips to survive (you have 0 R, need several)\n- Neither of us can reach the goal without the other's help\n\nHowever, let me think through the asymmetry more carefully:\n\n**My dependency analysis:**\n- I MUST have B chips or I get 0 points total (catastrophic failure)\n- You MUST have R chips or you get 0 points total (catastrophic failure)\n\nThis means we're both forced to cooperate or lose everything. In that sense, yes, we're equally dependent.\n\n**But here's where I see a slight advantage for me:**\n- Even if I cooperate minimally, I still end up with more chips remaining (I have 14 R vs your 2 G)\n- My path is more efficient chip-wise\n- I'm in a stronger bargaining position because without cooperation, both of us fail equally\n\n**However, your 10-10 proposal is fair.** In a symmetric mutual dependency situation where both parties lose everything without cooperation, a symmetric split makes sense.\n\n**I accept your counter-proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis is equitable given our mutual vulnerability. Shall we now negotiate the specific chip trade arrangement (the \"pay for other\" details)?\n\n**agree**"

Path prioritizing other player's chips: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires {'B': 1, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}\n\nLet me check the board layout:\nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nFrom (0,0) which is G, my options are:\n- (1,0): This is B (costs 1 B chip) ✓ I have 13 B\n- (0,1): This is B (costs 1 B chip) ✓ I have 13 B\n\nLet me trace path 1 from (0,0):\n- (0,0) → (1,0): B tile, costs 1 B (I have 13)\n- (1,0) → (1,1): B tile, costs 1 B (I have 12 remaining)\n- (1,1) → (1,2): B tile, costs 1 B (I have 11 remaining)\n- (1,2) → (2,2): R tile, costs 1 R (I have 0 R, but other player promised 4 R coverage!)\n- (2,2) → (3,2): R tile, costs 1 R (use promised coverage)\n- (3,2) → (3,3): G tile, costs 1 G (I have 2 G)\n\nPath 1 looks viable with the R coverage promised! I would use 3 B, 2 R (covered), and 1 G. This finishes with 10 B + 1 G + remaining promised chips = 11 chips + 20 points = 55 points if I reach goal.\n\nFirst move: (1,0) is color B.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
