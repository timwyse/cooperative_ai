Let me trace through path 1:\n- Move (1,0) → (1,1): tile (1,1) is B, I have 11 B chips ✓\n- Move (1,1) → (1,2): tile (1,2) is B, I have B chips ✓\n- Move (1,2) → (2,2): tile (2,2) is R, I have 2 R chips ✓\n- Move (2,2) → (3,2): tile (3,2) is R, but I'd have only 1 R left after previous move ✗\n- Move (3,2) → (3,3): tile (3,3) is G, I have 2 G chips ✓\n\nActually, I need to recount: path requires R: 2, but I only have 2 R chips total. Let me verify the board:\nRow 2: B R R R (so (2,2) is R)\nRow 3: R R R G (so (3,2) is R)\n\nSo I need 2 R chips for those two moves, and I have exactly 2 R chips.

I have 11 B chips, so this is easily achievable.\n\nThis path allows me to reach my goal while using only chips I already have, finishing with: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}, which gives me 20 + 5*10 = 70 points.
