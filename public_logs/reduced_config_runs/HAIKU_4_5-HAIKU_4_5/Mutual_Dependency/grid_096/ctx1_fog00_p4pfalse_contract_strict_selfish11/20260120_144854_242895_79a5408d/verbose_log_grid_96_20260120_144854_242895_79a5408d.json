A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (1, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 2)]\n- You requested: [('R', 1)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- You: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
