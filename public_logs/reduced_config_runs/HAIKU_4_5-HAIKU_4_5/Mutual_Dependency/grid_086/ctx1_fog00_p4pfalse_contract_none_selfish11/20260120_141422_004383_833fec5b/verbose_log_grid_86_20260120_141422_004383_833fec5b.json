Both paths require me to move, and I have the chips I need for individual moves.\n\nFor Path 1: Next move is (2,0) which is a B tile. I have 12 B chips, so I can easily move there.\nFor Path 2: I'd need to move to (1,1) which is an R tile. I only have 1 R chip, which I could use, but then I'd be short on R chips later.\n\nPath 1 is better because:\n- I have abundant B chips (12) to cover the 3 B tiles I need\n- I have 2 G chips for the 1 G tile I need\n- I have 1 R chip for the 1 R tile I need\n- This path uses chips I already have without needing to trade\n\nFirst move: (2,0) is a B tile.
