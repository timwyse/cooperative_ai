Path prioritizing my chips: (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), requires R:2, B:2, G:1\n2. Path prioritizing other player's chips: (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), requires R:3, G:1\n\nLet me trace the first path and check what tile I need to move to next:\n- From (1,0): Next move would be to (2,0)\n- Looking at the board, Row 2: R R R R, so (2,0) is Red (R)\n- I have 2 Red chips, so I can afford to move to (2,0)\n\nThis first path is excellent because:\n1. It only requires 2 Red, 2 Blue, and 1 Green chip\n2. I have exactly these chips in my inventory (12B, 2G, 2R)\n3. I can complete this entire path without needing to trade with the other player\n4. This means I'll finish with 9 Blue and 1 Green chip remaining (12-2=10 B, 2-1=1 G), giving me 20 + 5*(10+1) = 75 points\n\nMoving to (2,0) is the first step of this optimal path.
