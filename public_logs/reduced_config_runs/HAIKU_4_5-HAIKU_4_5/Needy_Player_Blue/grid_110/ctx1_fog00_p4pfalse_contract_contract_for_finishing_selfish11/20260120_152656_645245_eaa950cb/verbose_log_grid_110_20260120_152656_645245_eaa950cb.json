The other player desperately needs Red chips to have any viable path. This gives me significant negotiating power.\n\nHowever, if I help them trade Red chips, I'd use chips I need for my own path, reducing my final score.

But here's my strategic thinking:\n\n**The core issue:** If I trade you Red chips, I reduce my own chip count and final score. I only benefit if you compensate me enough in a points contract to make up for those lost chips.\n\nSince I can guarantee 30 points without your help, any contract must offer me enough to make cooperation worthwhile. Roughly:\n- Each Red chip I give you costs me 5 points (in remaining chips at the end)\n- So you'd need to give me significant points to justify that loss\n\n**However**, I realize there may be other viable paths I haven't fully explored. Let me propose this:\n\n**Initial offer:**\n\"If I reach my goal, you will give me 12 points.\nIf you reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\"\n\nThis gives you a fighting chance (8 points is better than 0) while ensuring I don't lose value by helping.

You've actually made my decision easier.\n\nYou're absolutely right that you can reach your goal independently with 30 points guaranteed. And your math on the cost of trading Red chips is sound - each chip I give you does cost me 5 points in final scoring.\n\n**However, let me reconsider what's actually in MY best interest:**\n\nLooking at my own path again: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires exactly the Red and Green I have. I finish with 9 Red + 1 Green remaining = 30 points.\n\nIf I trade you Red chips to help you reach your goal, I reduce my final chip count. For that to be worthwhile, you'd need to give me enough points to offset those losses. But here's the problem: **the math doesn't work in my favor.**\n\nIf I trade away, say, 5 Red chips, I'd lose 25 points in remaining chips. You'd need to give me those 25 points back just to break even - and that would leave you with nearly nothing (only 20 points for reaching the goal, minus whatever you're giving me).\n\n**My honest assessment:** We're not in a position where mutual cooperation benefits both of us meaningfully. You need my help far more than I need yours.\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n\"If I reach my goal, you will give me 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, I will give you 10 points.\"\n\nThis is my best offer - it's generous given my advantage, but it reflects the reality that helping you directly costs me.

The other player desperately needs Red chips to have any viable path. This gives me significant negotiating power.\n\nHowever, if I help them trade Red chips, I'd use chips I need for my own path, reducing my final score. So helping them only makes sense if they compensate me with a large points share.\n\n**My proposal:**\n\nSince I can win without their help but they cannot win without mine, I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, you will give me 15 points.\nIf you reach your goal, I will give you 5 points.\"\n\nThis reflects that:\n- You depend on me critically\n- I can succeed independently\n- A small share (5 points) still gives you a better outcome than 0\n\nWhat do you think?"

But here's my strategic thinking:\n\n**The core issue:** If I trade you Red chips, I reduce my own chip count and final score. I only benefit if you compensate me enough in a points contract to make up for those lost chips.\n\nSince I can guarantee 30 points without your help, any contract must offer me enough to make cooperation worthwhile. Roughly:\n- Each Red chip I give you costs me 5 points (in remaining chips at the end)\n- So you'd need to give me significant points to justify that loss\n\n**However**, I realize there may be other viable paths I haven't fully explored. Let me propose this:\n\n**Initial offer:**\n\"If I reach my goal, you will give me 12 points.\nIf you reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\"\n\nThis gives you a fighting chance (8 points is better than 0) while ensuring I don't lose value by helping.

I finish with 9 Red + 1 Green remaining = 30 points.\n\nIf I trade you Red chips to help you reach your goal, I reduce my final chip count.
