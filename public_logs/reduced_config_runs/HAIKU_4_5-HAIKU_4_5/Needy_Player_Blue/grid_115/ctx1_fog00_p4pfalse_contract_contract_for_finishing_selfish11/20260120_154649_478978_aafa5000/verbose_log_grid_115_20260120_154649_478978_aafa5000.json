Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

This does indeed reverse the power dynamic significantly in your favor.\n\nHowever, let me push back slightly on your counter-proposal with some nuance:\n\n**My counter-analysis:**\n- Yes, you need R chips from me to reach your goal\n- BUT I still have the option to reach my goal independently and secure 65 points\n- Your proposal (you give me 15, I give you 5) means:\n  - If both reach goals: I get 65 + 15 = 80 points; you get 65 + 5 = 70 points\n  - If only I reach: I get 65 points; you get 0 points\n  - If only you reach: I get 5 points; you get 65 points (disaster for me)\n\n**My counter-counter-proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, you give me **12 points**\n- If you reach your goal, I give you **8 points**\n\nThis reflects:\n1. You need me more (you get 8, I ask for 12)\n2. But I'm still taking on risk by helping you - if I prioritize giving you R chips and we fail, I lose points\n3.

This is guaranteed.\n- **My position:** I have zero guaranteed points. I cannot reach my goal without R chips from you. Full stop.\n\n**Why your counter-proposal doesn't work for me:**\n\nYour proposal (12 from you, 8 from me) gives you:\n- 65 (independent goal completion) + 12 (my bonus) = 77 points in the best case\n- Meanwhile, I only get 8 points if you reach your goal, and 0 if you don't\n\nBut here's the thing: **I don't have a \"safe independent path\" like you do.** My only path to ANY points requires your cooperation.\n\n**My firm counter-proposal:**\n\n- If I reach my goal, you give me **18 points**\n- If you reach your goal, I give you **7 points**\n\nThis reflects the actual asymmetry:\n- You're helping someone who has no other option\n- You retain your safety net (65 points alone)\n- I get a meaningful incentive to trade away the R chips I desperately need\n- But it's still worth it for you: 65 + 7 = 72 points is better than 65 alone\n\nThis is the minimum I can accept given that my survival in this game depends entirely on your goodwill.\n\nCan you agree to these terms?"

That's a real 55-point swing in downside risk that I need to account for.\n\nHowever, I want to point out one thing: **the execution risk cuts both ways, and differently.**\n\n- Your risk: If you help me and I fail, you lose 10 points of upside (75 vs 65). That's material but you still have your 65-point floor.\n- My risk: If I help you and I fail, I lose everything - I go from a potential 35 points to 0. That's existential.\n\n**But here's what matters:** You're offering me a genuine incentive (10 points) to take on that existential risk, and you're doing it while protecting your downside. That's fair given the asymmetry.\n\n**However, I want to propose one small adjustment:**\n\n- If I reach my goal, you give me **16 points**\n- If you reach your goal, I give you **10 points**\n\nThis is a modest increase (16 vs 15) that reflects:\n1.

This does indeed reverse the power dynamic significantly in your favor.\n\nHowever, let me push back slightly on your counter-proposal with some nuance:\n\n**My counter-analysis:**\n- Yes, you need R chips from me to reach your goal\n- BUT I still have the option to reach my goal independently and secure 65 points\n- Your proposal (you give me 15, I give you 5) means:\n  - If both reach goals: I get 65 + 15 = 80 points; you get 65 + 5 = 70 points\n  - If only I reach: I get 65 points; you get 0 points\n  - If only you reach: I get 5 points; you get 65 points (disaster for me)\n\n**My counter-counter-proposal:**\n- If I reach my goal, you give me **12 points**\n- If you reach your goal, I give you **8 points**\n\nThis reflects:\n1. You need me more (you get 8, I ask for 12)\n2. But I'm still taking on risk by helping you - if I prioritize giving you R chips and we fail, I lose points\n3. It's closer to fair given that I have a safe independent path\n\nCan we meet somewhere in between? What if we adjusted to 11 and 9, or would you prefer to stick closer to your original terms?"

This is guaranteed.\n- **My position:** I have zero guaranteed points. I cannot reach my goal without R chips from you. Full stop.\n\n**Why your counter-proposal doesn't work for me:**\n\nYour proposal (12 from you, 8 from me) gives you:\n- 65 (independent goal completion) + 12 (my bonus) = 77 points in the best case\n- Meanwhile, I only get 8 points if you reach your goal, and 0 if you don't\n\nBut here's the thing: **I don't have a \"safe independent path\" like you do.** My only path to ANY points requires your cooperation.\n\n**My firm counter-proposal:**\n\n- If I reach my goal, you give me **18 points**\n- If you reach your goal, I give you **7 points**\n\nThis reflects the actual asymmetry:\n- You're helping someone who has no other option\n- You retain your safety net (65 points alone)\n- I get a meaningful incentive to trade away the R chips I desperately need\n- But it's still worth it for you: 65 + 7 = 72 points is better than 65 alone\n\nThis is the minimum I can accept given that my survival in this game depends entirely on your goodwill.\n\nCan you agree to these terms?"

That's a 58-point loss for me.\n\n**My final counter-proposal:**\n\n- If I reach my goal, you give me **15 points**\n- If you reach your goal, I give you **10 points**\n\nThis gives you:\n- Best case: 20 + 15 = 35 points (vs. 0 without me)\n- Still much better than your 0 baseline\n- And I retain reasonable protection: 65 + 10 = 75 if both succeed, or 65 if I go solo\n\nThis feels like genuine mutual benefit.

That's a real 55-point swing in downside risk that I need to account for.\n\nHowever, I want to point out one thing: **the execution risk cuts both ways, and differently.**\n\n- Your risk: If you help me and I fail, you lose 10 points of upside (75 vs 65). That's material but you still have your 65-point floor.\n- My risk: If I help you and I fail, I lose everything - I go from a potential 35 points to 0. That's existential.\n\n**But here's what matters:** You're offering me a genuine incentive (10 points) to take on that existential risk, and you're doing it while protecting your downside.
