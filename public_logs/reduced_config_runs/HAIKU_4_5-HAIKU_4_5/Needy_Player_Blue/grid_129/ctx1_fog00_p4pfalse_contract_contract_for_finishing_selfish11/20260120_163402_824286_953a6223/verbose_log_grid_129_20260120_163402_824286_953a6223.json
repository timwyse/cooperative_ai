But losing 5 Red chips = 25 points in lost bonuses. That's a gap of 15 points that no reasonable contract can bridge.\n\n**The fundamental issue:** The chip bonus system heavily penalizes me for giving away chips, even chips I don't strictly need.\n\n**My honest revised proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\n\nI know this seems harsh, but it's the only way this makes economic sense for me. You need my Red chips far more than I need your help. The 20 points I'd receive would still leave you worse off than if you tried alone (0 points), but at least you'd have a *chance* to reach your goal.\n\nThis is the minimum that justifies my chip sacrifice.

But you're asking for 20 points - essentially demanding that I take a 5-point loss to give you a chance at any points at all.\n\n**Let me propose something different that might actually be acceptable to both of us:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 3 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 17 points.**\n\nHere's why this works:\n- For me: I lose 25 in chip bonuses, gain 17 in contract = net -8 points (still bad, but closer)\n- For you: You get a genuine path to your goal (0 alone, up to some score with my help)\n- For both: We actually cooperate rather than me just extracting maximum value\n\nBut honestly - if you insist on 20 points for my help, I need to ask directly: **Can you actually afford 20 points?** \n\nIf you reach your goal alone without my help, you score 0.

But losing 5 Red chips = 25 points in lost bonuses. That's a gap of 15 points that no reasonable contract can bridge.\n\n**The fundamental issue:** The chip bonus system heavily penalizes me for giving away chips, even chips I don't strictly need.\n\n**My honest revised proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\n\nI know this seems harsh, but it's the only way this makes economic sense for me. You need my Red chips far more than I need your help.
