The suggested path prioritizing my chips: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3) requires R:1, B:4, G:1. I'm missing 1 red chip.\n\n2. The suggested path using other player's chips: (3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires R:1, G:1, but I need to get to (3,1) first.\n\n3. Looking at the board from (0,0), my adjacent tiles are:\n   - (0,1) = B (I have 14 blue chips) ✓\n   - (1,0) = R (I have 0 red chips) ✗\n\nSince I have plenty of blue chips and (0,1) is blue, I should move there. This aligns with my best planned path which goes (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3).\n\nThe next move is to (0,1), which requires 1 blue chip. I have 14 blue chips, so this is possible.\n\nMoving east along row 0 using my abundant blue chips is a solid strategy - I won't need to trade with the other player if I can execute this path. The other player has rejected my trade offers three times, so I should pursue paths that don't require their cooperation.\n\nAfter (0,1), I can continue to (0,2)=B and (0,3)=B, then move down to (1,3)=B, (2,3)=B, finally (3,3)=G. This requires: B:4, G:1, which I have after using blue chips strategically. Wait - I need to recount: from (0,0) to goal requires moving through tiles at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3). That's 6 moves, costing the color of each destination tile: B, B, B, B, B, G = 4 blues and 1 green. Perfect - I have exactly this!\n\nFirst move: (0,1)",
