I don't have R, but I have 2 R promised. Cost: 1 R (covered)\n- (0,1) → (0,2): tile color is R. Cost: 1 R (covered - this uses my second promised R)\n- (0,2) → (1,2): tile color is R. Cost: 1 R (I don't have this covered!)\n\nHmm, this path requires 4 R moves but I only have 2 R promised.\n\nLet me look at what I can actually do:\nFrom (0,0), adjacent tiles are:\n- (1,0): Color R - I can move here using 1 of my 2 promised R chips\n- (0,1): Color R - I can move here using 1 of my 2 promised R chips\n\nBoth require R chips that I have promised coverage for. Let me pick (1,0) as it's part of the first suggested path.\n\nThe first move should be (1,0) since it's part of a path that gets me closer to my goal and I have coverage for the R chip needed.",

Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
