I have chips: B=14, G=2, R=0.\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nTwo main paths were suggested:\n1. Path through my chips: (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires R=2, B=3, G=1. I'm missing R=2.\n2. Path through other player's chips: (0,1)→(0,2)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3) requires R=4, G=1.\n\nLet me analyze my best immediate move:\n- (0,0) is G (my starting position, no cost to stay)\n- Adjacent tiles: (1,0)=R, (0,1)=R\n\nMy inventory is B=14, G=2, R=0. So I cannot move to R tiles without trading.\n\nLet me look for a path using B and G:\n- (0,0)→(0,1)=R (can't afford, need 1 R but have 0)\n- (0,0)→(1,0)=R (can't afford)\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. Looking at alternative paths:\n- Can I go (0,0)→... using tiles I have chips for?\n\nFrom (0,0):\n- Right to (0,1)=R - need R\n- Down to (1,0)=R - need R\n\nBoth neighbors require R which I don't have. However, I could potentially make a trade with the other player. \n\nBut first, let me think strategically: The other player is at (0,1) and has R=13, G=2. I have B=14, G=2. The board shows many B tiles and I have plenty of B chips. I also see R tiles along paths to the goal.\n\nSince both my immediate neighbors are R tiles and I have no R chips, I must either:\n1. Trade with the other player for R chips\n2. Find an alternate path (but I'm surrounded by R)\n\nActually, I should make my first move strategically. Since I can't move to R without trading, and I need to reach (3,3), I should consider proposing a trade first. But the instruction says to make a move now.\n\nLooking more carefully: I'm stuck at (0,0) with no adjacent B or G tiles. Both (1,0) and (0,1) are R tiles. I must either negotiate a trade or stay put.\n\nGiven I cannot move to any adjacent tile without R chips, and the other player has 13 R chips, this seems like a situation where I need to propose trading. But I should still try to move if possible.\n\nSince I cannot actually move to an R tile without having R chips or a trade agreement, I should stay put this turn and prepare to negotiate, OR I could move to (1,0) if I can get the other player to cover the cost - but I don't have a trade agreement yet.\n\nLet me reconsider: The rules state I can move if I have the chips OR if the other player has promised to cover it. I have no such promise yet. So I cannot move.\n\nI'll stay put this turn.",

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {'B': 2}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {'R': 1}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
