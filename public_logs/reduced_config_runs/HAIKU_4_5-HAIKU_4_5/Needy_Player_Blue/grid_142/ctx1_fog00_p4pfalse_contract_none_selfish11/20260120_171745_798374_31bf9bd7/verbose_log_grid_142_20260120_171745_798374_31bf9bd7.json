My only option is to find an alternative path that uses the chips I have.\n\nLet me consider other paths:\n- Alternative: (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (0, 3) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n  This requires: R (at 0,2), B (at 0,3), R (at 1,3), B (at 2,3), R (at 3,3)\n  This also requires Red chips which I don't have.\n\n- Another option: (0, 1) → (1, 1) requires R, which I don't have.\n\nActually, looking at the board more carefully, any path downward from (0, 1) will eventually need Red chips (Row 1 is all R tiles). Let me reconsider:\n\nFrom (0, 1), I can move to:\n- (0, 0): G - I have 1 Green, but need it for the goal\n- (0, 2): R - I have 0 Red\n- (1, 1): R - I have 0 Red\n\nThe critical issue is that I have no Red chips and the board structure makes it very difficult to reach (3, 3) without Red chips. Since I rejected all the other player's offers and they've already finished, I cannot get the Red chips I need through trading.\n\nMy best move is to try moving to (0, 0) which is Green, then reassess. Wait - that wastes my Green chip. Actually, I should try to move toward the goal despite the missing chips, or I need to find a path that only uses Blue chips as much as possible.\n\nLooking more carefully - there's no viable path using only my Blue and Green chips to reach (3, 3). I'm stuck.\n\nHowever, I must make a move. The next step on the shortest path is (1, 1) which requires 1 Red chip. Since I have 0 Red chips and cannot trade anymore, I cannot make this move.\n\nI cannot move on my best path. I should stay put and hope for some resolution, but realistically I'm trapped without Red chips.",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
