This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have R=14 and G=2, and my path only costs R=5 and G=1. I can walk to (3,3) completely independently.\n\nSo here's my selfish calculation:\n- Your proposal gives me 80 points IF you also reach your goal\n- But you reaching your goal depends entirely on me voluntarily trading Red chips to you\n- If I don't trade with you, I still get my 70 points alone\n\n**Why would I give you 10 of my points when:**\n1.

I can walk to (3,3) completely independently.\n\nSo here's my selfish calculation:\n- Your proposal gives me 80 points IF you also reach your goal\n- But you reaching your goal depends entirely on me voluntarily trading Red chips to you\n- If I don't trade with you, I still get my 70 points alone\n\n**Why would I give you 10 of my points when:**\n1. I don't need your help at all\n2. I can guarantee 70 points on my own\n3. You cannot reach your goal without my voluntary cooperation\n\nFrom a pure self-interest standpoint, my original proposal stands: I'll give you some chips to help you reach your goal (out of choice, not necessity), but only in exchange for points that sweeten MY final score beyond my guaranteed 70.\n\n**Revised proposal:**\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis gives you a path to 15 points (better than 0), while I secure 70 points guaranteed plus the satisfaction of maximizing my score through independence."

Let me be honest: you've correctly identified that you hold all the leverage. Your 15/0 proposal is mathematically superior for you.\n\n**But here's the real question:** Do you want 85 points, or would you take 82 to give me 5?\n\nIf the answer is \"I want 85,\" then your original proposal is optimal for you, and I should accept it because:\n- 15 points is better than my 0 point alternative\n- It's the best deal I can negotiate given the asymmetry\n\n**So my question back to you:** Are you sticking with your 15/0 proposal, or would you consider something slightly more generous in exchange for certainty of my agreement?\n\nWhat's your final offer?"

Here's why:\n\n**Your situation:**\n- 15 points is genuinely your best available option (and only path to any points at all)\n- You have zero alternatives\n- You will accept 15 points because it beats 0\n\n**My situation:**\n- I get 70 points guaranteed no matter what\n- Any additional points beyond 70 are pure gain\n- There is no downside for me to demand more—you can't walk away and do better elsewhere\n\nThe \"certainty\" argument only works if I had something to lose. But I don't. If you reject my offer, I still get 70 points. If you accept, I get 85. From a pure self-interest perspective, I can afford to wait you out because I'm guaranteed to win regardless.\n\n**My final proposal (unchanged):**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis is optimal for me because:\n1.

However, I do need red chips to start my journey.\n\nLooking at my options: I need to trade some of my blue chips for red chips to make my first move. The other player has 13 red chips and 2 green chips. This is a situation where I must cooperate minimally - I need at least 2 red chips to pursue my best independent path.\n\nLet me make my first move attempt: I cannot move yet without red chips.

My goal is at (3,3).\n\nMy inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nThe optimal path suggested is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nThis path requires: {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}\nI'm missing 2 red chips.\n\nHowever, I notice the other player is at (2,2) and their goal is also (3,3). They're very close to the goal. Looking at the board, they can move: (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3). The tile at (2,3) is G, and they have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}. So they can reach the goal in 2 moves.\n\nCritically, there's a contract where if I reach the goal, I get 0 points from the other player, but if the other player reaches the goal, I must give them 15 points. This is a huge penalty for me if they finish first.\n\nLet me reconsider my strategy. I need to reach my goal, and the scoring is:\n- Reach goal: 20 + 5 × (remaining chips)\n- Don't reach goal: 0 (lose everything)\n\nThe other player is about to finish. I should focus on reaching my goal as quickly as possible. The first step from (0,0) is to move to (1,0), which requires a Red chip. But I have 0 Red chips.\n\nLooking at adjacent tiles from (0,0):\n- (1,0) = R (I don't have)\n- (0,1) = R (I don't have)\n\nI cannot move without Red chips. I'm stuck.\n\nHowever, I could try a different approach - I need to accumulate Red chips. The only way to do this is through trades. But the other player has rejected multiple trade proposals. They have 10 Red chips and only 2 Green chips. They won't trade Red chips away easily when they're about to win.\n\nMy best option now: I must attempt to move. Since I can't move from (0,0) without Red chips, and I have no way to get them (the other player won't trade), I cannot make progress.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. Maybe I should stay put and try once more to propose a trade, but at this point the other player is likely to ignore me as they're about to reach the goal.\n\nActually, I realize I cannot move without Red chips, so I must set want_to_move to false. But this means I'll almost certainly lose (get 0 points) since I can't reach my goal.",
