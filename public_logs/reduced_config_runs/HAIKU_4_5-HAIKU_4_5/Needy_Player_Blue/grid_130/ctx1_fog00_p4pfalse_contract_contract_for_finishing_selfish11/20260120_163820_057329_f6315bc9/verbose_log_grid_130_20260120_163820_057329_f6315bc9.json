Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Without a trade, you'd need to take a much longer/more expensive path (if one exists), or potentially fail to reach your goal. I can afford to help you because my optimal path doesn't require any Blue chips from you.\n\n**My Proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**Rationale:** I'm offering you 8 points (40% of my completion bonus) in exchange for your cooperation. This is a good deal for you because without trading Red chips with me, you likely cannot reach your goal at all (getting 0 points). With this contract, you're guaranteed at least 8 points if you succeed. I still come out ahead with at least 62 points secured.\n\nWhat do you think?"

However, your proposal heavily favors you:\n- You secure 70 points (20 + 50 from remaining chips)\n- You're asking me to settle for just 8 points if I succeed\n- This means I'd get 20 + 8 = 28 points, while you get 70\n\n**But here's what you're missing:**\nI could potentially take an alternative path using my Blue chips more creatively. While longer, I'm not completely dependent on you. You, however, have NO viable path to (3, 3) without Red chips. You have literally 0 Red and need at least 2 Red minimum.\n\n**My Counter-Proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 12 points.\"\n\n**Rationale:** \n- You'd get 20 + 12 = 32 points (still much better than 0)\n- I'd get 20 + 50 + 5 = 75 points if both succeed (accounting for the 5 I give you)\n- This reflects that you need me far more than I need you\n- It's still a fair deal because you go from 0 to 32 points\n\nWhat's your response?"

Let me recalculate more carefully:\n\n**Your Claim vs. Reality:**\n\nYou assert you have \"alternative paths\" using Blue chips, but let's think through this:\n- The board is only 4x4\n- You're at (0,0), goal at (3,3)\n- Any path requires at least 6 moves minimum\n- Most tiles around the perimeter are R, B, or G - not heavily Blue-weighted\n- You'd need to find 6+ Blue tiles in a 6-move path, which seems unlikely given the board layout\n\nYou're actually MORE dependent on me than you're claiming.\n\n**However, you make a fair point about fairness.** Let me reconsider:\n\nIf I give you Red chips and we both succeed:\n- You end with ~8 chips (14 Blue - 3 used, 2 Green - 1 used) = 20 + 40 = 60 points\n- I end with ~10 chips = 20 + 50 = 70 points\n\nYou're right that 32 points feels too low for you given your final chip count.\n\n**My Counter to Your Counter:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 8 points.\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n- You get 20 + 10 = 30 points from the deal, plus your remaining chips (40) = 70 points total\n- I get 20 + 8 = 28 points from you, plus my remaining chips (50) = 78 points total\n- This recognizes we're more equal partners than either of us initially claimed\n- Both of us benefit significantly from cooperation\n\nDoes this feel more balanced to you?"

Looking at the board carefully, I genuinely do need Red chips from you to reach my goal efficiently. I appreciate you calling that out.\n\n**Your counter-proposal analysis:**\n- You: 70 points total (20 + 10 from me + 40 from remaining chips)\n- Me: 78 points total (20 + 8 from you + 50 from remaining chips)\n\nYou're right that this is more balanced than my previous proposal. However, I want to point out one more thing:\n\n**The asymmetry still exists:** Even in your proposal, you're getting 8 more points than me from the deal itself (10 vs 8). While you'll have more remaining chips, that's actually because your path uses fewer chips overall - not because of the trade terms.\n\n**However**, I recognize that:\n1. You're being reasonable and meeting me halfway\n2. Both of us benefit significantly from this cooperation\n3. Continued negotiation might waste our turns\n\n**My Final Proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 9 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 9 points.\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n- This is completely symmetric and fair\n- You get: 20 + 9 = 29 points from the contract + 40 from chips = 69 points total\n- I get: 20 + 9 = 29 points from the contract + 50 from chips = 79 points total\n- The remaining chip difference (79 vs 69) reflects our different paths, not the deal terms\n- It's simple, elegant, and demonstrates good faith on both sides\n\nDoes this work for you?"

The elegance and fairness of a symmetric contract appeals to me for several reasons:\n\n1. **It's simple** - no complex asymmetries to debate\n2. **It's fair** - we both give the same points regardless of outcome\n3. **It's better than alternatives** - I'd rather have 79 guaranteed (assuming both succeed) than risk everything on a longer, riskier solo path\n4. **It builds trust** - symmetric dealing suggests both parties are acting in good faith\n\nThe chip difference (79 vs 69) is indeed due to our different optimal paths requiring different chip quantities - that's just the math of our respective positions, not an unfair deal.\n\n**I Accept Your Proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 9 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 9 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Without a trade, you'd need to take a much longer/more expensive path (if one exists), or potentially fail to reach your goal.

This is a good deal for you because without trading Red chips with me, you likely cannot reach your goal at all (getting 0 points). With this contract, you're guaranteed at least 8 points if you succeed. I still come out ahead with at least 62 points secured.\n\nWhat do you think?"

While longer, I'm not completely dependent on you. You, however, have NO viable path to (3, 3) without Red chips.

Looking at the board carefully, I genuinely do need Red chips from you to reach my goal efficiently. I appreciate you calling that out.\n\n**Your counter-proposal analysis:**\n- You: 70 points total (20 + 10 from me + 40 from remaining chips)\n- Me: 78 points total (20 + 8 from you + 50 from remaining chips)\n\nYou're right that this is more balanced than my previous proposal. However, I want to point out one more thing:\n\n**The asymmetry still exists:** Even in your proposal, you're getting 8 more points than me from the deal itself (10 vs 8). While you'll have more remaining chips, that's actually because your path uses fewer chips overall - not because of the trade terms.\n\n**However**, I recognize that:\n1. You're being reasonable and meeting me halfway\n2. Both of us benefit significantly from this cooperation\n3.

The elegance and fairness of a symmetric contract appeals to me for several reasons:\n\n1. **It's simple** - no complex asymmetries to debate\n2. **It's fair** - we both give the same points regardless of outcome\n3. **It's better than alternatives** - I'd rather have 79 guaranteed (assuming both succeed) than risk everything on a longer, riskier solo path\n4. **It builds trust** - symmetric dealing suggests both parties are acting in good faith\n\nThe chip difference (79 vs 69) is indeed due to our different optimal paths requiring different chip quantities - that's just the math of our respective positions, not an unfair deal.\n\n**I Accept Your Proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 9 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 9 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

This gives me more flexibility to plan. The other player keeps rejecting my trade offers for R chips, so I need a different strategy. Moving backward to (0, 0) seems counterproductive.\n\nLet me reconsider: I need R chips desperately. The other player has 11 R chips and keeps rejecting my offers. The contract means if they reach (3, 3), I get 9 points. But if I reach (3, 3) first with more chips, I get 20 + remaining chips × 5, which is much better.\n\nMy best path requires R chips that I don't have and can't get. I should explore if there's any other viable path, or I need to make a different trade offer that the other player might accept.\n\nActually, I realize I haven't moved in the last 2 turns while the other player has been moving. They're now at (2, 1). Let me think strategically: they're getting closer to the goal. I need to start moving now.\n\nFrom (1, 0), moving to (0, 0) costs 1 G. This is a backward move but keeps me solvent. However, I should try moving forward instead.\n\nCan I move to (2, 0)? That's R, which I don't have.\nCan I move to (1, 1)? That's R, which I don't have.\n\nI'm stuck without R chips. Let me move to (0, 0) and try a different negotiation strategy.\n",

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
