Can't complete my path (need 5 Red but only have 13), OR\n2.

Your Blue chips help you reach the goal, not me. So this only works if you can provide me value equal to the Red I'm sacrificing.\n\nCan you guarantee reaching your goal if I trade you 1 Red?

However, I'm missing 1 R chip for the complete path.\n\nMy best immediate move is to (2,0) - a B tile - which keeps me on track for Path 1 and uses a chip I have in abundance. From (2,0), I can continue to (2,1) which is R (problem!), so I may need to reconsider or trade later.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: Moving to (2,0) puts me on a path where I'll need R chips I don't have. I should consider staying put and negotiating for R chips, or finding an alternate route.\n\nWait - let me look at the board again:\nRow 1: B R B B (I'm at position (1,0) which is B)\nRow 2: B R B B\n\nIf I move to (2,0) it's B - I can do this. Then from (2,0) I'd move to (2,1) which is R - I'd need an R chip I don't have.\n\nThe other player rejected my trade request. Since they have R=12 and I need R, I should consider if there's another path using my G chips, or if I should hold position and propose a better trade.\n\nFor now, the safest move that makes progress is to move to (2,0) - a B tile I can afford.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
