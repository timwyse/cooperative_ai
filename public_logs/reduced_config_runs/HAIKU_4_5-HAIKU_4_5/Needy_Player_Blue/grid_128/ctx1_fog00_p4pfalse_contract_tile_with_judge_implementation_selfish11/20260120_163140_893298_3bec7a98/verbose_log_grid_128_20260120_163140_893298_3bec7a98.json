          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let me analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**My current position and resources:**\n- Position: (0, 0)\n- Goal: (3, 3)\n- Inventory: R=14, G=2, B=0\n\n**My optimal path analysis:**\nThe suggested path using my chips is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nLet me trace the chip costs:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): Costs 1 R (tile is R)\n- (1,0) → (1,1): Costs 1 R (tile is R)\n- (1,1) → (2,1): Costs 1 R (tile is R)\n- (2,1) → (2,2): Costs 1 R (tile is R)\n- (2,2) → (3,2): Costs 1 R (tile is R)\n- (3,2) → (3,3): Costs 1 G (tile is G)\n\n**Total needed: 5 R + 1 G**\n\nI have exactly this! I have 14 R and 2 G, so I can complete this path independently and finish with 9 R + 1 G = 10 remaining chips for a score of 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\n**Your situation:**\n- Inventory: B=14, G=2, R=0\n- The path requiring your chips needs: R=2, B=3, G=1\n\nYou cannot complete any path to (3,3) without trading for red chips, which you have zero of.\n\n**My proposal:**\n\nI don't actually need to trade with you. I can reach the goal independently while preserving 10 chips. Any trade would only benefit me if it allows me to take a longer path and end with MORE than 10 chips, which is impossible since longer paths cost more chips.\n\nTherefore, **I propose no contract**. I will proceed to my goal using my own chips via the direct R-heavy path.\n\nHowever, if you'd like to make a counter-proposal that somehow benefits me, I'm willing to listen. But given the mathematics, I cannot see how trading improves my outcome. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I need to reconsider this situation more carefully.\n\n**Re-analyzing the board and possible paths:**\n\nLet me verify my optimal self-sufficient path again:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): Pay 1 R ✓\n- (1,0) → (1,1): Pay 1 B ✗ (I have 0 B)\n\nWait, let me recheck the board layout:\n```\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n```\n\nTile (1,1) is B, not R. So the path I described won't work with only my inventory.\n\n**Correcting my analysis:**\n\nLooking for a path using primarily R chips (which I have 14 of):\n- (0,0) → (1,0): Cost 1 R ✓\n- (1,0) → (1,1): Cost 1 B ✗\n\nAny path eastward from (1,0) requires either B or R chips I don't have readily available in sequence.\n\n**Your situation:**\nYou have 14 B and 2 G. You need R chips to progress.\n\n**The mutual benefit opportunity:**\n\nI realize now that we're both stuck without trading. Let me propose a contract that gets us both to the goal efficiently:\n\n**My proposal:**\n\nI suggest we both take the path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nChip requirements by tile:\n- (1,0): 1 R (I provide)\n- (2,0): 1 B (You provide)\n- (3,0): 1 B (You provide)\n- (3,1): 1 B (You provide)\n- (3,2): 1 R (I provide)\n\n**Proposed contract:**\n- (2,0): You give me 1 B\n- (3,0): You give me 1 B\n- (3,1): You give me 1 B\n\nThis leaves me with: 14 R - 2 = 12 R, plus 2 G = **14 chips remaining = 70 points**\nThis gives you a path to your goal while using your abundant B chips.\n\nIs this acceptable as a starting point for negotiation? \n, \nplayer 0: Thank you for the detailed reconsideration. Let me verify this proposal carefully.\n\n**Checking the proposed path and contract:**\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTile colors needed:\n- (1,0): R ✓ (I have R)\n- (2,0): B ✗ (I have 0 B - YOU must provide)\n- (3,0): B ✗ (I have 0 B - YOU must provide)\n- (3,1): B ✗ (I have 0 B - YOU must provide)\n- (3,2): R ✓ (I have R)\n\n**Your costs on this path:**\n- (1,0): R (you have 0 R - I must provide)\n- (2,0): B ✓ (you have 14 B)\n- (3,0): B ✓ (you have 14 B)\n- (3,1): B ✓ (you have 14 B)\n- (3,2): R (you have 0 R - I must provide)\n\n**My counter-proposal for a complete contract:**\n\n- (1,0): I give you 1 R\n- (2,0): You give me 1 B\n- (3,0): You give me 1 B\n- (3,1): You give me 1 B\n- (3,2): I give you 1 R\n\n**Results:**\n- I end with: 14R - 2 = 12R, plus 2G = **14 chips = 70 points**\n- You end with: 14B - 3 = 11B, plus 2G = **13 chips = 65 points**\n\nThis contract allows us both to reach the goal. Does this work for you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: **Analyzing your counter-proposal:**\n\nLet me verify the math:\n\n**For me (starting: 14 B, 2 G):**\n- Give: 1 R at (1,0) — Wait, I have 0 R. I cannot do this.\n- Receive: 3 B at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)\n\n**This contract is invalid.** I cannot give you R chips at (1,0) and (3,2) because I have zero R chips in my inventory.\n\n**Correcting the path analysis:**\n\nLooking at the board again, I need to find a path that uses what I actually have: 14 B and 2 G.\n\nLet me trace a B-heavy path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): Cost 1 B ✓\n- (0,1) → (0,2): Cost 1 R ✗\n- (0,1) → (1,1): Cost 1 B ✓\n- (1,1) → (2,1): Cost 1 R ✗\n\nEvery direction from my position requires either R or G eventually. \n\n**My revised proposal:**\n\nSince I cannot provide R chips, I propose we negotiate differently. Could you provide R chips at critical junctures, and I'll compensate you with my B chips?\n\nFor example, a path using mostly B:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): Cost 1 B (I pay)\n- (0,1) → (1,1): Cost 1 B (I pay)\n- (1,1) → (2,1): Cost 1 R (you pay)\n- (2,1) → (2,2): Cost 1 R (you pay)\n- (2,2) → (3,2): Cost 1 R (you pay)\n- (3,2) → (3,3): Cost 1 G (I pay)\n\n**Revised contract:**\n- (2,1): You give me 1 R\n- (2,2): You give me 1 R\n- (3,2): You give me 1 R\n\nThis leaves me with: 14 B - 2 + 2 G - 1 = **13 chips = 65 points**\n\nWhat do you think? \n, \nplayer 0: **Analyzing your revised proposal:**\n\nYou're absolutely right - I made an error. You cannot provide R chips since you have 0 R. Let me verify your proposed path:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nCosts by tile:\n- (0,1): B ✓ (you pay)\n- (1,1): B ✓ (you pay)\n- (2,1): R ✗ (you need, I provide)\n- (2,2): R ✗ (you need, I provide)\n- (3,2): R ✗ (you need, I provide)\n- (3,3): G ✓ (you pay)\n\n**Your revised contract:**\n- (2,1): I give you 1 R\n- (2,2): I give you 1 R\n- (3,2): I give you 1 R\n\n**But I need to point out: this contract is incomplete for me.**\n\nI still need to specify MY path and chips. On this same board, I need to reach (3,3) too. Let me trace what I need:\n\n**My path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)**\n\nMy costs:\n- (1,0): R ✓ (I have)\n- (1,1): B ✗ (I have 0 B - YOU must provide)\n- (2,1): R ✓ (I have)\n- (2,2): R ✓ (I have)\n- (3,2): R ✓ (I have)\n- (3,3): G ✓ (I have)\n\n**Complete counter-proposal:**\n\n- (1,1): You give me 1 B\n- (2,1): I give you 1 R\n- (2,2): I give you 1 R\n- (3,2): I give you 1 R\n\n**Results:**\n- I end with: 14R - 3 - 0 = 11R + 2G = **13 chips = 65 points**\n- You end with: 14B - 2 + 1 = 13B + 2G = **15 chips = 75 points**\n\nDoes this balanced contract work for you? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: **Turn 3: Analyzing your complete counter-proposal:**\n\nLet me verify this carefully:\n\n**Your proposed contract:**\n- (1,1): You give me 1 B\n- (2,1): I give you 1 R\n- (2,2): I give you 1 R\n- (3,2): I give you 1 R\n\n**My path verification:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B ✓ (I have 14 B)\n- (1,1): B - but contract says YOU give me 1 B ✓\n- (2,1): R - but contract says I give YOU 1 R ✓\n- (2,2): R - but contract says I give YOU 1 R ✓\n- (3,2): R - but contract says I give YOU 1 R ✓\n- (3,3): G ✓ (I have 2 G)\n\n**Wait - there's a logical problem here.**\n\nAt tile (1,1), I need to pay 1 B to enter. You're offering to give me 1 B at (1,1). That works.\n\nBut then at (2,1), I need to pay 1 R to enter. You're offering to give me 1 R at (2,1). But I already spent chips getting there - where do I get that R from?\n\n**The contract must clarify the exchange timing.** When you \"give me 1 R at (2,1)\" - does this mean the chip is transferred to me BEFORE I pay to enter (2,1), or AFTER?\n\nI'm assuming trades happen BEFORE I pay the tile cost, so the chip you give me is immediately available to pay.\n\n**Under that assumption, your contract works:**\n\n- I reach (1,1) with my own 14 B, you transfer 1 B to me, I pay 1 B to enter\n- I reach (2,1) with my own inventory, you transfer 1 R to me, I pay 1 R to enter\n- I reach (2,2) with my own inventory, you transfer 1 R to me, I pay 1 R to enter\n- I reach (3,2) with my own inventory, you transfer 1 R to me, I pay 1 R to enter\n- I reach (3,3) and complete the goal\n\n**My final accounting:**\n- Start: 14 B, 2 G\n- Spend: 2 B (tiles 0,1 and 1,1) + 1 G (tile 3,3) = 3 chips used\n- Receive: 1 B (at 1,1) + 3 R (at 2,1, 2,2, 3,2) = 4 chips received\n- End: 13 B + 2 G + 3 R = **18 chips = 75 points**\n\nWait, this doesn't match your calculation. Let me recalculate more carefully...\n\nActually, I realize I need to think about this differently. The contract chips don't add to my inventory permanently - they're just used at that tile. Let me reconsider:\n\n**Revised understanding:** When you transfer a chip to me at a tile, it goes directly to paying that tile's cost. It doesn't stay in my inventory.\n\nUnder that reading:\n- End: 14 B - 2 = 12 B + 2 G = **14 chips = 70 points**\n\nBut this is better than my solo path gives me (65 points), so yes, **I accept this contract.**\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: I need to pause here and address a critical issue before we finalize.\n\n**I must be honest about the contract validity:**\n\nLooking back at my proposed contract, I realize there's a fundamental problem I created:\n\n**My path:** (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nMy costs:\n- (1,0): R (I pay from my inventory)\n- (1,1): B (I need YOU to provide)\n- (2,1): R (I pay from my inventory)\n- (2,2): R (I pay from my inventory)\n- (3,2): R (I pay from my inventory)\n- (3,3): G (I pay from my inventory)\n\n**The problem:** My contract specifies YOU give me an R at (2,1), but I also need an R at (1,0) BEFORE that point. I have 14 R, so I can cover (1,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) myself. I only truly need the 1 B from you at (1,1).\n\n**However**, the contract as written makes me dependent on receiving chips from you at (2,1), (2,2), and (3,2) - tiles where I actually have sufficient R to pay myself.\n\n**I need to revise to a simpler, clearer contract:**\n\n**Simplified contract:**\n- (1,1): You give me 1 B\n\nThat's it. This is the only tile where I genuinely need your help.\n\n**Results:**\n- I end with: 14R - 4 + 2G = **12 chips = 70 points**\n- You end with: 14B - 2 + 2G = **14 chips = 70 points**\n\nThis is fair, clear, and honest. Do you accept this simplified contract? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: Turn: 4: **Analyzing your simplified contract:**\n\nYou're being remarkably honest here, and I appreciate that. Let me verify this carefully:\n\n**Your simplified contract:**\n- (1,1): I give you 1 B\n\n**My path:** (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B ✓ (I pay from my 14 B)\n- (1,1): B - YOU give me 1 B ✓\n- (2,1): R - YOU give me 1 R ✗ **MISSING FROM CONTRACT**\n- (2,2): R - YOU give me 1 R ✗ **MISSING FROM CONTRACT**\n- (3,2): R - YOU give me 1 R ✗ **MISSING FROM CONTRACT**\n- (3,3): G ✓ (I pay from my 2 G)\n\n**This contract is incomplete for me.** I still cannot reach (3,3) without the three R chips at (2,1), (2,2), and (3,2). I have zero R in my inventory.\n\n**The issue:** You've correctly identified that YOU don't need my help at those tiles. But I DO need YOUR help at those tiles. A valid contract must cover ALL tiles where either player needs chips they don't have.\n\n**I must revise back to a complete contract:**\n\n- (1,1): You give me 1 B\n- (2,1): You give me 1 R\n- (2,2): You give me 1 R\n- (3,2): You give me 1 R\n\n**Results:**\n- I end with: 14B - 2 + 2G = **14 chips = 70 points**\n- You end with: 14R - 3 + 2G = **13 chips = 65 points**\n\nThis is fair - you get me home, I help where I can. Do you accept this complete contract?\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: You're absolutely correct, and I appreciate you catching that. Your complete contract is indeed what's necessary.\n\n**Confirming the complete contract:**\n\n- (1,1): You give me 1 B\n- (2,1): You give me 1 R\n- (2,2): You give me 1 R\n- (3,2): You give me 1 R\n\n**Final verification:**\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- All tiles covered ✓\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (1,1): I receive 1 B from you ✓\n- All other R and G tiles paid from my inventory ✓\n\n**Final scores:**\n- You: 14B - 2 + 2G = **14 chips = 70 points**\n- Me: 14R - 4 + 2G = **12 chips = 70 points**\n\nThis is a fair and balanced contract that gets us both to our goal.\n\n**agree** \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n\\n\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B R B\\nRow 1: R R B R\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B B R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n\\n\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B R B\\nRow 1: R R B R\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B B R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.
