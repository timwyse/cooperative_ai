The direct suggested path (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires 2 Red chips I don't have\n2. I need to find a path using mostly Blue and Green chips\n\nLet me trace the board:\nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nFrom (0,0) which is Green, I can move to:\n- (0,1) = Red (can't move, no red chips)\n- (1,0) = Red (can't move, no red chips)\n\nThis is a critical problem. Both adjacent tiles to my starting position are Red tiles, and I have no Red chips. I cannot move anywhere without Red chips.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the game state: the other player has already finished. This means I'm in a dire situation - I'm locked in place with no way to move without Red chips, and the other player rejected all trade offers.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I cannot make ANY move from (0,0) because:\n- (0,1) requires 1 Red chip - I have 0\n- (1,0) requires 1 Red chip - I have 0\n\nI'm stuck. I cannot move and the other player won't trade. My best option is to not move and potentially wait, but there's no way forward. Since I cannot reach my goal, I will score 0 points.\n\nGiven this impossible situation, I should indicate that I cannot move, as I literally have no valid moves available.",
