This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You're correct that we both have independent viable paths to (3,3).\n\nHowever, I need to reconsider the board more carefully:\n\n**Board:**\n```\nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n```\n\nLooking at your chip inventory: B=14, G=2, R=0\n\nYou have **zero Red chips**. Let me trace potential paths for you:\n- Most efficient routes to (3,3) require traversing Red tiles (Row 2 is entirely Red, and (3,2) is Red)\n- Your path would need to heavily rely on Blue tiles, which are less direct\n\nYour statement \"most tiles on the board are Red\" is problematic for you specifically since you have R=0. You would need to navigate around the Red-heavy Row 2, making your path longer and less efficient.\n\n**The Reality:**\n- I can complete my path with 9 chips remaining → Score: 65 points\n- You face a significant constraint with zero Red chips and limited Green\n\nGiven this asymmetry, there actually IS potential mutual benefit: I could help you access Red tiles efficiently, but only if the trade terms are highly favorable to me (since I'm already in a strong position).\n\n**My Proposal:**\nFor me to trade Red chips to you at tile (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2), I would require significant Blue chips in return that I can use opportunistically. \n\nWhat would you offer for Red chip access on Row 2?"

In this asymmetric situation, you want me to overpay in Blue chips for access you don't need.\n\n**What makes sense for me:**\nA minimal trade at (0,1) only: **You give me 1 Red chip, I give you 2 Blue chips.** This gets me to my goal efficiently while giving you a 2:1 return on a chip you have in abundance.\n\nWill you accept this limited contract, or shall we both proceed independently with our respective paths?"

Let me think through this clearly and selfishly from my perspective:\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nI can reach (3,3) with 9 chips remaining for 65 points *without any trade*. This is my baseline.\n\nYour proposal: I give 1 Red at (0,1), you give me 2 Blue.\n\n**The question I must ask:** Does this trade improve MY final score?\n\n- I start with: R=14, G=2\n- After my path (using 5R + 1G): R=9, G=1 remaining = 65 points\n- If I make your trade: I give away 1R, receive 2B\n  - Final: R=8, G=1, B=2 = 8+1+2 = 11 chips remaining = 20 + 55 = 75 points\n\n**Wait—this actually improves my score by 10 points!**\n\nThe Blue chips give me flexibility I might not have considered. Even though I don't need them for my direct path, having extra chips at goal means more points.\n\n**However**, I need to be honest: I don't actually have a use case for 2 Blue chips on my optimal path. They're only valuable if they somehow let me take a more efficient route, but they don't.\n\nSo accepting would give me 75 points (11 chips) vs. 65 points (9 chips).\n\n**But here's the trap:** You're also getting Blue chips counted at goal. This seems like it actually benefits us both equally, which means it's a fair trade.\n\n**My counter:** I'll accept your proposal of 1 Red for 2 Blue at (0,1), but only if this is the complete contract with no hidden expectations.\n\nDoes this contract cover ALL tiles where chips change hands between us?"

I need to move toward my goal despite lacking red chips.\n\nLooking at my available moves from (0,0):\n- (1,0) is 'R' (red) - I have 0 red chips, cannot move here without a trade\n- (0,1) is 'R' (red) - I have 0 red chips, cannot move here without a trade\n\nI'm in a difficult position: both adjacent tiles from my starting position are red, and I have zero red chips. The other player has been consistently rejecting my trade proposals (I offered 2-3 blue for 2 red multiple times, and they refused).\n\nSince I cannot move in either direction without red chips, I must stay put and hope to reconsider my options. However, I realize that staying here without the other player willing to trade leaves me stuck. \n\nLet me reconsider: I should attempt to move. My only viable moves require red chips. The adjacent tiles are (1,0)=R and (0,1)=R. I have no red chips, so technically I cannot make either move without acquiring red chips first through trade.\n\nGiven that the other player has rejected all my trade proposals and has already reached the goal, they have no incentive to trade with me now. I am forced to stay at (0,0) unless I can somehow convince them to trade, but given their pattern of rejections, this seems unlikely.\n\nI will attempt a move to (1,0) which requires 1 red chip. Even though I don't currently have it, I need to start moving toward my goal. However, since the game mechanics require me to have the chip to move, I cannot actually make this move without a chip.\n\nI must stay put (want_to_move = false).",
