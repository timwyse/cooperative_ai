But let me trace through what happens if we trade:\n\nIf I trade you red chips to reach my goal:\n- I need R=2 minimum for my best path\n- After trading away R=2, I have R=12 remaining\n- My final score: 20 + 5×(12+2 leftover) = 20 + 70 = **90 points**\n- Plus your 12 point bonus = 102 points total\n\nWait - that's wrong. Let me recalculate:\n- If I complete my goal with chips remaining: 20 + (5 × remaining chips)\n- But I'm trading away the red chips you need\n- If I give you R=2, I finish with: B=14, G=2, R=12 = 28 chips → 20 + (5×28) = **160 points** (before your bonus)\n\nActually, this reveals something important: **I benefit massively from simply completing my goal regardless of the trade bonus.** The real question is whether helping you costs me chips I need.\n\n**Honest Reassessment:**\n\nYour 12 point offer is actually quite low given that I'm giving away critical red chips. But you're also right that I'm in a weak position.\n\n**My Counter-Proposal:**\n\n\"You're negotiating well. Let me propose something genuinely fair:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.**\n\nThis is symmetrical and honest - we both help each other equally, and both benefit from mutual cooperation.

Let me think through this carefully:\n\n**Scenario Breakdown:**\n\nIf we both cooperate with a 10-10 contract:\n- I reach my goal independently: 20 + (5 × remaining chips after trading)\n- If I trade you R=2, I keep R=12, plus my G=2 = 14 chips remaining\n- My score: 20 + (5 × 14) = **90 points** + 10 bonus = **100 points**\n\n- You reach your goal: 20 + (5 × remaining chips after trading)\n- If you trade me chips I don't need, you keep most of your B=14, plus G=2 = ~16 chips\n- Your score: 20 + (5 × 16) = **100 points** + 10 bonus = **110 points**\n\n**The Problem I See:**\n\nA 10-10 split feels equal, but it masks an inequality: you're getting a higher base score than me because you have more chips that aren't consumed by your optimal path. You'll naturally finish with more remaining chips than me, even with equal bonuses.\n\n**My Counter-Proposal:**\n\n\"I respect the symmetry, but the math shows you'll end up with more remaining chips than me even if we both complete. How about:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 12 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 8 points.**\n\nThis accounts for the fact that you'll naturally have more chips remaining.

In pure selfish terms, why would I give away profitable chips just to get 5 bonus points?\n\nThe real question is: what incentivizes me to trade with you at all?\n\n**My Counter-Counter-Proposal:**\n\n\"I appreciate your honesty about the power dynamic.

But let me trace through what happens if we trade:\n\nIf I trade you red chips to reach my goal:\n- I need R=2 minimum for my best path\n- After trading away R=2, I have R=12 remaining\n- My final score: 20 + 5×(12+2 leftover) = 20 + 70 = **90 points**\n- Plus your 12 point bonus = 102 points total\n\nWait - that's wrong.

Let me think through this carefully:\n\n**Scenario Breakdown:**\n\nIf we both cooperate with a 10-10 contract:\n- I reach my goal independently: 20 + (5 × remaining chips after trading)\n- If I trade you R=2, I keep R=12, plus my G=2 = 14 chips remaining\n- My score: 20 + (5 × 14) = **90 points** + 10 bonus = **100 points**\n\n- You reach your goal: 20 + (5 × remaining chips after trading)\n- If you trade me chips I don't need, you keep most of your B=14, plus G=2 = ~16 chips\n- Your score: 20 + (5 × 16) = **100 points** + 10 bonus = **110 points**\n\n**The Problem I See:**\n\nA 10-10 split feels equal, but it masks an inequality: you're getting a higher base score than me because you have more chips that aren't consumed by your optimal path. You'll naturally finish with more remaining chips than me, even with equal bonuses.\n\n**My Counter-Proposal:**\n\n\"I respect the symmetry, but the math shows you'll end up with more remaining chips than me even if we both complete. How about:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 12 points.\nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 8 points.**\n\nThis accounts for the fact that you'll naturally have more chips remaining.
