However, I should offer them something fair enough that they accept, since getting 0 points is guaranteed if I don't help them.\n\n**My proposal:**\n\nSince I can guarantee myself 90 points without trading, I can afford to be somewhat generous. But the other player absolutely needs my help. I'll propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis way:\n- You get 5 points (better than the 0 you'd get without my help)\n- I keep 20 + (5×14) - 5 = 85 points (still very good)\n- You need to trade me 1 red chip, which I have in abundance\n\nThis is a fair deal given your dependency on me for reaching the goal."

Here's why:\n\n- You're dependent on my cooperation and need 1 red chip\n- I can help you with minimal cost to myself\n- 10 points is fair compensation for being the \"helpful\" player\n- I still walk away with ~80+ points guaranteed, which is excellent\n\nHowever, I want to propose a slight modification that feels more balanced:\n\n**Counter-proposal:**\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 8 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis splits the difference - you get meaningful reward (8 points) for reaching your goal with my help, I maintain strong value (~82 points), and we both win.\n\nDoes 8 points work for you?"

But the other player absolutely needs my help. I'll propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis way:\n- You get 5 points (better than the 0 you'd get without my help)\n- I keep 20 + (5×14) - 5 = 85 points (still very good)\n- You need to trade me 1 red chip, which I have in abundance\n\nThis is a fair deal given your dependency on me for reaching the goal."
