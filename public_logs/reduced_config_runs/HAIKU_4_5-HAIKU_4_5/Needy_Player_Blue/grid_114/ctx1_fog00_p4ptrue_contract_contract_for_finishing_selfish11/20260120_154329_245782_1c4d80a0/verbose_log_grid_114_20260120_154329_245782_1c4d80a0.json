In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

There's a contract where if I reach my goal, they give me 2 points, and if they reach their goal (which they have), I give them 14 points. However, this contract is about giving points after reaching the goal - it doesn't change my primary objective of reaching (3, 3) myself.\n\nLooking at my inventory and the board:\n- I have 11 B chips\n- I need R and G chips to reach the goal\n- The other player won't trade with me (they've rejected multiple offers and have already finished)\n\nMy best path from (0, 1) to (3, 3): [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]\nThis requires: R:1, B:3, G:1\nI have: B:11, but I'm missing R:1 and G:1\n\nLet me examine the board layout and possible paths:\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nFrom (0, 1) which is B:\n- Up: out of bounds\n- Down: (1, 1) = R (need 1 R - I don't have)\n- Left: (0, 0) = G (need 1 G - I don't have)\n- Right: (0, 2) = R (need 1 R - I don't have)\n\nI'm stuck. I cannot move in any direction because:\n- All adjacent tiles require either R or G chips\n- I only have B chips\n- The other player will not trade with me\n\nHowever, I should still attempt a move. Looking more carefully: I could move to (0, 0) which is G, but I have 0 G chips. I could move to (1, 1) which is R, but I have 0 R chips.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I should try to move toward the goal. The most direct path would be to go down and right. Let me try (1, 1) even though it costs an R chip I don't have - perhaps the game mechanics allow me to go negative? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI cannot make any move without the required chips, and the other player won't help. I should stay put and wait, hoping the game ends or I gain chips somehow. But the instructions say to make a move if possible.\n\nLet me try moving to (1, 1) which requires R chip - I don't have it, so I cannot move there. I'm in a stuck position. \n\nSince I cannot move without chips I don't have, and there's no trade arrangement to help me, I should not move.",
