However, let me think about whether there's mutual benefit here:\n\nThe issue with your proposal is that it gives you an incentive (5 points if you reach your goal), but I'd be trading away Red chips that are valuable to me, and getting nothing tangible in return during gameplay - only points after completion.\n\n**My counter-counter-proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.**\n\nThis way:\n- I still score 70 + 0 = 70 if both succeed\n- You score 20 + (remaining chips) + 15 = a decent outcome if you succeed\n- I'm incentivized to actually trade Red chips with you because the 15 points compensates for my effort\n- You're not giving points away since you're already dependent on me\n\nWhat do you think?"

However, there's a critical issue:\n\n**The chip trade problem:**\nIf I give you Red chips during gameplay, I'm reducing my own finishing chip count. Let's say I trade you 5 Red chips:\n- My new score: 20 + 5×(4+1) = 20 + 25 = **45 points** (not 70)\n- Plus your 15 points = 60 total\n\nThat's worse than my original 70!\n\n**So the real issue:** Your 15-point offer doesn't actually compensate me for the chips I'd lose. I need more points to make it worth sacrificing my chip count.\n\n**My counter-proposal:**\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.**\n\nThis way:\n- I get 70 + 20 = **90 points** (a genuine incentive)\n- You get approximately 20 + (remaining chips after buying Red from me) + 20 = potentially 40+ points (much better than 0)\n\nThis is genuinely fair: you get a real shot at points, and I get compensated for the chips I'm giving up.\n\nDoes this work for you?"
