Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Since the other player keeps rejecting my offer of \"cover 2B for 2R\", perhaps they want a different arrangement or more incentive. But wait - let me reconsider: I can afford one more move if I move to (3, 1) with the other player covering 1 R for me. Then I'd need 1 more R for (3, 2) and 1 G for (3, 3).\n\nActually, I should wait and propose a new trade. But given the current situation, I cannot move forward without R chips that I don't have and the other player won't cover.\n\nLet me stay put and signal that I need to negotiate: I'll attempt to move to (3, 1) which requires 1 R - the other player can choose to cover this for me if we have an agreement. If they won't, I'll need to stay put.\n\nActually, re-reading the rules: I can make the move, and if the other player has promised to cover R chips for me, they pay. But we have NO such agreement in place.\n\nI cannot move to (3, 1) because:\n1. It costs 1 R chip\n2. I have 0 R chips\n3. The other player has not promised to cover R chips for me\n4. I cannot stay on a red tile\n\nTherefore, I cannot move right now. I should stay put.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
