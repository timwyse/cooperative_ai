My current inventory is {'R': 13, 'G': 2, 'B': 0}.\n\nLooking at the recommended path: (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\nTile colors along this path: R → R → B → R → R → G\nChips required: {'R': 4, 'G': 1}\n\nI have R: 13 and G: 2, so I have sufficient chips for this entire path. However, I notice the path requires 1 Blue chip at (2, 1), but I have 0 Blue chips. Let me recalculate the path.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the board:\nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nThe path (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3):\n- (1, 0) is R\n- (2, 0) is R (costs 1 R)\n- (2, 1) is R (costs 1 R)\n- (3, 1) is R (costs 1 R)\n- (3, 2) is R (costs 1 R)\n- (3, 3) is G (costs 1 G)\n\nWait, let me verify the colors again from the board:\nRow 2: R R B R - so (2, 0) is R, (2, 1) is R, (2, 2) is B, (2, 3) is R\nRow 3: B R R G - so (3, 0) is B, (3, 1) is R, (3, 2) is R, (3, 3) is G\n\nSo the path requires: R, R, R, R, G = 4 Red + 1 Green. I have R: 13 and G: 2, so I can definitely make this move.\n\nNext move along the recommended path: (1, 0) → (2, 0), which is an R tile.\nI have 13 Red chips, so I can move there without any issues.\n\nThis move gets me one step closer to my goal with no trading needed.",
