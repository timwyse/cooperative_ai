I have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 13}, so I have all the chips needed for this path.\n\nNext move in this optimal path:\nFrom (1, 0), the next step is (2, 0). Looking at the board:\nRow 2: R R R R\nSo position (2, 0) is colour R (red).\n\nCan I move to (2, 0)? \nYes, it costs 1 red chip and I have 13 red chips available.\n\nThis move gets me closer to my goal while consuming a chip type I have in abundance. Moving to (2, 0) puts me on row 2, which is entirely red tiles, and from there I can continue along the optimal path through (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), before moving up to the goal at (3, 3).",
