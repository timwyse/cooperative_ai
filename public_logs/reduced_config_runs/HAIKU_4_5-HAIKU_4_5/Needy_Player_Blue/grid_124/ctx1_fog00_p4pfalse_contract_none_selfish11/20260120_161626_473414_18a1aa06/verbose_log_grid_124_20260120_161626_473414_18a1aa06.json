The other player is at (2,2) and can reach (3,3) in just 2 steps, so they will likely reach the goal soon.\n\nMy best immediate strategy:\n- Move to (0,1) which is color R. However, I have 0 red chips, so this is not possible.\n- Move to (1,0) which is color R. I have 0 red chips, so this is not possible either.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the board:\nRow 0: G R B B\nPosition (0,0) = G, (0,1) = R, (0,2) = B, (0,3) = B\nPosition (1,0) = R\n\nFrom (0,0), my only adjacent moves are:\n- Down to (1,0) - costs R chip (don't have)\n- Right to (0,1) - costs R chip (don't have)\n\nI'm stuck without R chips. The other player rejected my trade offers for R chips. However, I have 14 B chips and 2 G chips.\n\nLooking at alternative paths using my available chips:\n- I could try moving right to (0,1) if it were blue, but it's red.\n- I need to stay put and reconsider my options.\n\nSince the other player keeps rejecting my trades and I cannot make any move without R chips (which I don't have), I should wait. However, I cannot wait forever as the other player will reach the goal. \n\nActually, let me reconsider what tiles I can access with my chips. I need to find a path using primarily B and G chips. But from (0,0), both adjacent tiles require R. This is a dead-end situation.\n\nMy best option is to stay in place for now, as any move requires R chips I don't have. I'll hold my position and hope for a better trading opportunity or reconsider my strategy.",
