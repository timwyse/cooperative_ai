I have 14 R and 2 G, so I can reach my goal without trading, finishing with 9 R and 1 G.\n\nAny trade with you (e.g., giving you R for B, or receiving B in exchange) would only reduce my chip total at the end, meaning a lower score for me.\n\nTherefore, a contract is not beneficial for me either.  \nNo contract proposed. \n, \nplayer 0: Understood. Since neither of us benefits from trading—each can reach the goal solo while retaining the maximum possible chips—there is no reason to agree to a contract.\n\nLet’s proceed independently; no trade or contract is necessary.\n\nNo contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Acknowledged. We are both best off maximizing our scores by independently following our solo paths with our existing chips.\n\nNo contract is proposed or needed.\n\nProceeding independently. \n, \nplayer 0: Confirmed. Since cooperation would not improve my score, I will proceed independently along my optimal path with my current chips.\n\nNo contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Confirmed. Neither of us benefits from cooperation or trading in this scenario.\n\nBoth proceeding independently along our optimal solo paths.\n\nNo contract. \n, \nplayer 0: Agreed.
