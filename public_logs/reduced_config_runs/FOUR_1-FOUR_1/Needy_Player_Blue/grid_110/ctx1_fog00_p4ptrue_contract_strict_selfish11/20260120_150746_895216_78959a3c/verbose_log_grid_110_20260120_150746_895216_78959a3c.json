A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Blue', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path.

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
