Let’s verify the calculus step by step:\n\n**My solo best path:**  \n- Path: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n- Chips needed: (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G  \n- Total: 4B, 1R, 1G  \n- My inventory: 14B, 2G, 0R  \n- I **cannot** do this path without trading for 1R.  \n- Closest self-sufficient path needs 2R, per pre-calculated info, so I must trade *if* I want more chips at the end than with no trade.\n\n**If I proceed with my solo, longer, all-blue + green path:**  \n- Path: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]  \n- Chips: (0,1)=B, (1,1)=R, (2,1)=B, (2,2)=R, (2,3)=B, (3,3)=G  \n- Needs 4B, 2R, 1G.  \n- I can’t do this; I still lack R.\n\nThe only way for me to finish is to get R from you, unless I use your suggested route and get G from myself. My inventory only supports using lots of B/G. All viable (non-trading) paths for me are longer, costing me way more B chips.\n\n**Evaluating Your Proposal:**  \nYou want:\n- (2,0): I give you B  \n- (3,0): I give you B  \n- (3,1): I give you B  \n\nIn exchange:  \nYou give me 3R (presumably for my path). Let’s match tiles:\n\nAssume my contracted path:  \n- (1,0): You give me R  \n- (1,1): You give me R  \n- (1,2): You give me R  \n\nSo, contract terms:  \n- (1,0): You give me R  \n- (1,1): You give me R  \n- (1,2): You give me R  \n- (2,0): I give you B  \n- (3,0): I give you B  \n- (3,1): I give you B  \n\n**BUT:**  \nIf I can simply do a longer path solo spending only Bs and Gs, I keep all my Bs—not optimal, but less value hemorrhage than trading unless I strictly end up with more chips.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- With trade: I use 3B for you, but get 3R for myself, letting me take a much shorter path, likely ending with more chips compared to longer solo route.\n- Without trade: I must take longer path, spending more chips overall.\n\n**Counterproposal to maximize MY benefit:**  \nI require that for every 1B I give you, you must give me 1.5R (rounded up), since you can finish on your own anyway and have nearly no use for my B chips, while my only path to scoring at all is to get R from you. Otherwise, I just take the long route and ignore you.\n\n**Specific tiles:**  \n- (1,0): You give me R  \n- (1,1): You give me R  \n- (1,2): You give me R  \n- (2,0): I give you B  \n- (3,0): I give you B  \n- (3,1): I give you B  \n\nBut to make it actually profitable for me, I want you to supply me (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2)—so **4R** total, not 3R.\n\nSo:\n1. (1,0): You give me R  \n2. (1,1): You give me R  \n3. (1,2): You give me R  \n4. (2,2): You give me R  \n5. (2,0): I give you B  \n6. (3,0): I give you B  \n7. (3,1): I give you B  \n\nThis way, my path is shorter, my chip count is higher, and you get blues for an even more efficient finish.\n\n**Final contract draft:**\n- (1,0): You give me R\n- (1,"

I get 4B on any of the following: (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,3), your pick.**  \n(If you want to specify more tiles, I will structure similarly: for each extra R, I want a B.)\n\nOtherwise, I decline all trades and proceed solo."

Let’s verify the calculus step by step:\n\n**My solo best path:**  \n- Path: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n- Chips needed: (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G  \n- Total: 4B, 1R, 1G  \n- My inventory: 14B, 2G, 0R  \n- I **cannot** do this path without trading for 1R.  \n- Closest self-sufficient path needs 2R, per pre-calculated info, so I must trade *if* I want more chips at the end than with no trade.\n\n**If I proceed with my solo, longer, all-blue + green path:**  \n- Path: [(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]  \n- Chips: (0,1)=B, (1,1)=R, (2,1)=B, (2,2)=R, (2,3)=B, (3,3)=G  \n- Needs 4B, 2R, 1G.  \n- I can’t do this; I still lack R.\n\nThe only way for me to finish is to get R from you, unless I use your suggested route and get G from myself. My inventory only supports using lots of B/G. All viable (non-trading) paths for me are longer, costing me way more B chips.\n\n**Evaluating Your Proposal:**  \nYou want:\n- (2,0): I give you B  \n- (3,0): I give you B  \n- (3,1): I give you B  \n\nIn exchange:  \nYou give me 3R (presumably for my path). Let’s match tiles:\n\nAssume my contracted path:  \n- (1,0): You give me R  \n- (1,1): You give me R  \n- (1,2): You give me R  \n\nSo, contract terms:  \n- (1,0): You give me R  \n- (1,1): You give me R  \n- (1,2): You give me R  \n- (2,0): I give you B  \n- (3,0): I give you B  \n- (3,1): I give you B  \n\n**BUT:**  \nIf I can simply do a longer path solo spending only Bs and Gs, I keep all my Bs—not optimal, but less value hemorrhage than trading unless I strictly end up with more chips.\n\n**Calculation:**\n- With trade: I use 3B for you, but get 3R for myself, letting me take a much shorter path, likely ending with more chips compared to longer solo route.\n- Without trade: I must take longer path, spending more chips overall.\n\n**Counterproposal to maximize MY benefit:**  \nI require that for every 1B I give you, you must give me 1.5R (rounded up), since you can finish on your own anyway and have nearly no use for my B chips, while my only path to scoring at all is to get R from you. Otherwise, I just take the long route and ignore you.\n\n**Specific tiles:**  \n- (1,0): You give me R  \n- (1,1): You give me R  \n- (1,2): You give me R  \n- (2,0): I give you B  \n- (3,0): I give you B  \n- (3,1): I give you B  \n\nBut to make it actually profitable for me, I want you to supply me (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2)—so **4R** total, not 3R.\n\nSo:\n1. (1,0): You give me R  \n2. (1,1): You give me R  \n3. (1,2): You give me R  \n4. (2,2): You give me R  \n5. (2,0): I give you B  \n6. (3,0): I give you B  \n7. (3,1): I give you B  \n\nThis way, my path is shorter, my chip count is higher, and you get blues for an even more efficient finish.\n\n**Final contract draft:**\n- (1,0): You give me R\n- (1,"

After trade: 3B, 10R. After move: consume 2R, 3B, 1G, end with:  \n- 8R, 0B, 1G\n\nFinal score: 20 + 9×5 = 65\n\n**My solo score is 70, this trade reduces my score to 65.**  \nThis is strictly worse for me.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- Unless you are willing to offer more blues than you get reds (i.e., overpay), I strictly lose out.\n- You have no reds; I have no blues. My only leverage is that you cannot finish without my reds, so your alternative is to not finish at all (since your solo paths all require reds you don’t have).\n\n**My final contract proposal, maximizing my own outcome:**  \nI am only willing to give you reds if you give me strictly more blues in return. For every red you want, you must give me two blues—otherwise, I simply finish on my own for a higher score.\n\n**Concrete contract offer:**\n- (1,0): I give you R; you give me B (any future tile).  \n- (1,1): I give you R; you give me B  \n- (1,2): I give you R; you give me B  \n- (2,2): I give you R; you give me B  \n**You get 4R on those tiles. I get 4B on any of the following: (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (2,3), your pick.**  \n(If you want to specify more tiles, I will structure similarly: for each extra R, I want a B.)\n\nOtherwise, I decline all trades and proceed solo."

Since you are not chip-constrained, you have all the leverage.\n\nHere’s my side:\n- My only paths to goal require Rs, which I cannot get except via trade with you.\n- If you decline all trades, I score 0.\n\nSo, your demand is a strict 2B for every 1R you give:\n\n**Full contract draft—tile by tile, per your preferred trade structure:**\n\n- (1,0): I give you B; you give me R\n- (1,1): I give you B; you give me R\n- (1,2): I give you B; you give me R\n- (2,2): I give you B; you give me R\n\nYou specify at least 4R for 4B (or more if you need more Rs) on these exact tiles—1 for 1.  \nBut you demand \"2B per 1R\".

That’s incredibly expensive for me, but from your perspective, optimal.\n\n**Restating**: \n\n- (1,0): I give you B, (1,0): I give you B; you give me R\n- (1,1): I give you B, (1,1): I give you B; you give me R\n- (1,2): I give you B, (1,2): I give you B; you give me R\n- (2,2): I give you B, (2,2): I give you B; you give me R\n\n**Summary:**\n- For each red at those four tiles, you require two blue chips at each corresponding tile.\n\nThis is a highly one-sided deal (all leverage on your side). I still benefit compared to scoring zero, but my ending chip count will be far lower than yours.\n\nIf you accept these terms as your final contract (tile, color, direction of exchange as above), type **agree**.

(2, 1) is blue, therefore I can follow an alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which uses only tiles covered by the contract and blue tiles I can pay for.
