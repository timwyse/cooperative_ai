What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Here is my situation and optimal selfish negotiation logic:\n\n- I need to get from (0,0) to (3,3).\n- I have enough red and green chips to reach my goal without your help (using the path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]), spending 5R + 1G. I don’t need any blues.\n- You have plenty of blue, but no red, so you are stuck unless you can get reds from me in exchange for something.\n\nSince I do **not** need any of your chips to achieve my goal, the only reason for me to cooperate is if you offer a deal where I give you some red chips (so you can reach your goal), and in exchange you give me blue or green chips, so I finish with more total chips.\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n**You give me 6 blue chips, I give you 6 red chips.**  \nThis allows you to traverse a path where you need reds, and I get blues to finish with.  \nWe need to specify exact tiles for where this occurs.\n\n- If you are taking the path (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G], then you would need 5R + 1G.  \n- You already have the G, so you need 5R.\n\nSo:  \n- (0,1): I give you a R  \n- (1,1): I give you a R  \n- (2,1): I give you a R  \n- (3,1): I give you a R  \n- (3,2): I give you a R  \n\nIn exchange, you give me blue at these tiles (one to one mapping for simplicity):\n\n- (0,2): You give me a B  \n- (1,0): You give me a B  \n- (1,2): You give me a B  \n- (2,0): You give me a B  \n- (2,2): You give me a B  \n\nIf you accept, we can both reach our goals and finish with more chips than otherwise.\n\nLet me know if you accept or wish to counter! \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I have no incentive to do this trade as proposed.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n- I can already reach my goal using the blues I have along my own optimal path:  \n  Path: (0,0) [start]  \n  → (1,0) [B]  \n  → (2,0) [B]  \n  → (3,0) [B]  \n  → (3,1) [R]  \n  → (3,2) [R]  \n  → (3,3) [G]  \n- Chips required: 3B, 2R, 1G  \n- My inventory: 14B, 2G, 0R; I am missing 2R.\n\nSo, for me to ever trade, you must give me 2 reds for 2 blues (since you have extra, and you need none of my blues).\n\nFor me, giving you more than 2 blues for 2 reds just leaves me with fewer chips for no benefit.\n\n**My proposal:**\n\n- (3,1): You give me a R  \n- (3,2): You give me a R  \n- In exchange:  \n- (1,0): I give you a B  \n- (2,0): I give you a B  \n\nThis covers the two tiles where I need R, and you benefit by getting 2 blues with no cost to your own path (since you don't need blue at all).  \nIf you want to specify alternative tiles for blue, let me know.\n\nIf you want to change the number upward, I reject—I have no reason to give more than I need, for chips I have no use for.  \nIf you agree to this, say so, otherwise counter. \n, \nplayer 0: Your logic is sound: you don’t need to offer more than a 2R-for-2B deal, since your only constraint is missing 2 reds and I have no need for blue. From my selfish perspective, I already have all the chips I need for my own optimal path, and could ignore you entirely and get 50 points (20 for reaching my goal, +30 for leftover chips).\n\nHowever, if I accept this deal, I finish with 2 extra blues. Since every leftover chip is worth 5 points (and I can still walk my optimal red path because I have excess red), this trade gives me 10 extra points for nothing lost.\n\nI accept your proposal.\n\n**Terms:**\n- (3,1): I give you a R  \n- (3,2): I give you a R  \n- (1,0): You give me a B  \n- (2,0): You give me a B  \n\nI confirm and accept.  \nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: agree \n",
