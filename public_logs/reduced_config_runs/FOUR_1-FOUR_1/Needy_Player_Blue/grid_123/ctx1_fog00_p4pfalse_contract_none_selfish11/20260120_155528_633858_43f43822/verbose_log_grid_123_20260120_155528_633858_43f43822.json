The most viable path for me that uses the chips I have is: (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), requiring {B: 3, R: 1, G: 1}, missing only 1R. The next move from (1,0) to (2,0) is a B tile, and I have 13 B chips, so I can move there without any issues. This puts me closer to the goal while not costing chips I lack. Since this move is strictly progressing me toward the goal using chips I have in abundance, and there is no benefit to waiting or trading at this point (since I only lack 1R for the whole path, and can always try to trade for it later, or take a longer alternate path if needed), I should move.",
