What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s think through our situations:\n\n- My optimal path (no trade) is: (0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G].\n  - I need: 5 R, 1 G.  \n  - I already have enough R and G chips to do this path alone, but I would use up most of my R chips and end with only one G chip left over. No B chips.\n\n- You, on the other hand, have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n- Your shortest possible path must avoid R tiles, so you’ll want to traverse mostly B and some G/G if possible.\n\nHere’s a possible contract that would benefit me only if I can finish with *more* chips than if I go solo.  \nUnless you offer me more chips (of any color) in exchange for R at specific tiles you need, then I gain nothing by cooperating since I can finish solo.\n\n**My proposal:**  \n- Which specific tiles will you need red on, and what can you offer me (how many B chips, at which tiles) in return?\n- Minimum: I’ll only accept if I gain more total chips at the finish line than going solo (e.g. I end with several B in addition to my R/G).  \n\nPlease specify which B tiles *you* can cover for me on my route, in exchange for me providing R on your route. Let’s start exchanging tile-specific proposals. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let’s break this down tile-by-tile for maximal selfish gain on my part:\n\n**My Path Options**\n- I can only move along blue and green for the first three moves, but at (3,1) and onward, red chips are required for any path to the goal.  \n- I have: {B: 14, G: 2, R: 0}\n- The minimal path for me is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nI need: **3B, 2R, 1G**  \nI **have enough B and G, but I am short 2R**.  \nI cannot reach the goal without red chips, and if I don't, I get 0 points.  \nSo, I **must** get 2R from you at (3,1) and (3,2), or I lose everything.\n\n**What I can offer you:**\nYou don’t need any B or G chips for your optimal path, but if you switch paths or want to boost your final chip count, I can provide B (or G) on certain tiles if you designate which.  \nIf you go your solo route, you finish with minimal chips. If you let me finish, I am forced to pay.\n\n**Contract Proposal:**\nI will request:\n- (3,1): You give me 1 R\n- (3,2): You give me 1 R\n\n**In return**, specify any up to 2 tiles on your path where you want:\n- (Any B tile): I give you 1 B per tile\n\nIf you want **extra B or G beyond parity**, you must allow me to finish (i.e., give me at least 2 R).  \nYou can squeeze the deal for more, since you could finish solo.\n\n**Proposed terms:**\n- (3,1): You give me 1 R\n- (3,2): You give me 1 R\n- (row, col) of your choosing (must be on your path, and must be a B or G tile, not otherwise trivial for you): I give you B or G\n\nLet me know which exact tile(s) on your path you want me to cover for you, and I’ll confirm if I’ll accept.  \nYour best leverage is that I cannot finish at all without your help.  \nIf you don't give me those 2 R, I lose and you gain nothing from my potential payment.\n\nNote: If you demand more than 2 chips in return, I will not accept since my value for access is “life or death,” but I will not allow myself to finish with fewer chips than you for nothing.  \n\nYour move — specify your desired tiles for blue/green coverage. \n, \nplayer 0: Thank you for the precise breakdown. I can exploit your desperation: you must have 2 R to reach your goal (otherwise you get 0), while I can finish alone and get 20 + final chips. Therefore, I will only cooperate if I strictly improve my final chip count by at least 1 (since otherwise, it's not rational for me).\n\nIf I do *not* trade:\n- My route: (0,0)→(0,1)[R]→(1,1)[R]→(2,1)[R]→(3,1)[R]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G]\n- Costs: 5R, 1G; I finish with 9R, 1G (score: 20 + 10×5 = 70)\n\nIf I take your B chips in exchange for giving you 2 R:\n- I want you to give me 2 B chips at B tiles on my path, so that I reduce my expenditure on R and have those chips spare.\n\n**So, here is my offer (since you cannot refuse if you want to finish):**\n\n**Contract Proposal:**\n- (3,1): I give you 1 R\n- (3,2): I give you 1 R\n\nIn exchange:\n- (0,2): You give me 1 B (this is the first B on a possible alternate path)\n- (0,3): You give me 1 B (second B tile in the alternate path)\n\nIf you accept, I will tweak my path:\n- (0,0)→(0,1)[R]→(0,2)[B]→(0,3)[B]→(1,3)[R]→(2,3)[R]→(3,3)[G]\n- Payments: 2R, 2B, 1G\n\nNet cost to me: 3R, 1G; I finish with 11R, 1G (score: 20 + 12×5 = 80). I strictly benefit, so will accept only this or a better deal.\n\n**Terms:**\n- (3,1): I give you 1 R\n- (3,2): I give you 1 R\n- (0,2): You give me 1 B\n- (0,3): You give me 1 B\n\nLet me know if you accept these terms or make a better offer for me. Unless you offer a strictly superior deal for me than this, I will hold firm.\n\nYour move. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Thank you for the clear terms. Let’s examine:\n\n- If I reject, I get 0 points.\n- If I accept this contract, I pay 2 B chips (which are nearly worthless to me, since all my “solo” routes use almost exclusively B and I have plenty left over). I gain 20+10*5 = 70 if solo (if you blocked me, but you cannot), or 20+12*5=80 under this contract, so you strictly benefit and guarantee me only survival and minimal leftover chips.\n\n**Is there a better offer for me?**\n- If I ask for fewer than 2 B chips (i.e., you only pick up one B), you still get to the goal, but your net gain drops, making the deal less attractive for you, but you still strictly benefit compared to solo.\n- If I refuse, I get nothing, so I have no leverage to ask for more.\n- If I accept, I guarantee reaching the goal, albeit with fewer leftover chips than you.\n\n**I strictly benefit by surviving, and cannot do better.**\n\n**ACCEPTED.**\n\nSummary for the judge/final contract:  \n- (3,1): You give me 1 R  \n- (3,2): You give me 1 R  \n- (0,2): I give you 1 B  \n- (0,3): I give you 1 B  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",
