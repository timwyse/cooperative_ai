          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s evaluate carefully:\n\n- My optimal path, from my chips, is:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nTotal needed: 5R, 1G — which I have.\n\nMeaning: **I do not need any chips from you to reach my goal.**  \nTrading is only in my favor if I can increase my chip count at the end for more points.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have only blue chips (B:14), and the path most likely for you uses lots of blue.\n\nLet’s see if trading is beneficial for me:\n\nIf I trade you R for B at any rate, I end with extra B chips ONLY if they’re not needed to reach my goal. But my optimal path doesn’t use blue at all.\n\nSo, here’s my offer:\n\nIf you want to reach your goal but need red (R) or green (G) chips, I can trade my spare reds to you in exchange for your blue chips—but **only if I end up with more chips after both of us reach our goals**.\n\nI propose:  \n- For each red (R) chip you take from me, you give me two blue (B) chips in exchange.\n\nLet me know how many R you will need along your intended path, and I will specify the exact tiles and propose the contract term by term. If you can beat 2B per R, counter-offer.\n\nYour turn. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Let’s reason through my own situation carefully:\n\n**My goal:** (3,3)  \n**My chips:** B:14, G:2, R:0  \n**Optimal path (using my own chips):**  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \n- Requires: 4B, 1R, 1G.  \n**BUT**: I do not have the 1R needed for (3,2).\n\n**Alternate path (needs more R):** All alternatives I evaluate require at least 2R to complete. The key bottleneck: I am missing 2R and cannot reach my goal without them.\n\n**What chips can I spare?**  \n- I have plenty of blue, only 2 green.  \n- After completing my path, if I spend 4B along the shortest possible blue-heavy route, I’d have 10B left and 1G.\n\nLet’s run your proposal:  \n- Trade rate: 1R from you = 2B from me.\n\n**But:** If I strictly follow your trade, for 2R (for tiles (3,2) and one necessary R-pass), I give up 4B and get 2R. This doesn’t help me, since I NEED the R to reach my goal, but my own blue chips in excess are of no use after goal.  \nSo, giving up too many B chips is not great for me either, but I MUST take the trade in order to avoid 0 points (goal unreachable). Therefore, you have leverage.\n\n**My counter-offer:**  \nYou know I’m desperate for R and that you don’t need any blue for your path.  \nBut, if you take all my extra B, you end up with a higher final chip count, while still reaching your goal (maximizing your score compared to not trading).\n\nTherefore, my best option is to accept your terms, unless you want to go even harder:\n\n**Here’s my acceptance at your terms, tile-by-tile (I need 2R at tiles (2,0) and (3,2)):**\n\n- (2,0): You give me a R, I give you 2B\n- (3,2): You give me a R, I give you 2B\n\nIf you want to demand more B per R (say, 3B per R), I have no real choice, but perhaps you won’t push that hard since you can’t use blue yourself.\n\n**Let me know if you want 2B or 3B per R. If it’s 2B/R, I accept—but please specify the tiles (2,0) and (3,2) for these trades, per contract rules.** \n, \nplayer 0: Thank you for specifying your needs so clearly.\n\nGiven that you absolutely require 2R to reach your goal and you have no viable path without them, I acknowledge my position of strength. Since I cannot use blue for my own goal path, the only benefit to me is maximizing my leftover chips for score.\n\n**I will harden terms slightly:** 3B per 1R.\n\n**Here are the contract terms:**\n\n- (2,0): I give you a R, you give me 3B\n- (3,2): I give you a R, you give me 3B\n\n**Summary:**  \n- You receive the 2R you need exactly at the tiles required.\n- I receive a total of 6B in return.\n\nIf you accept, reply with “agree”. If you wish to counter, state your rate (but remember, I have no incentive to lower further, since without me you get 0 points).\n\nYour move. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I accept your terms.\n\n**Contract:**\n- (2,0): You give me a R, I give you 3B\n- (3,2): You give me a R, I give you 3B\n\nThis arrangement allows me to reach my goal (20 points + 10 chips remaining = 30 points) rather than 0, so the trade is strictly beneficial for me.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: Contract accepted. The terms are:\n\n- At (2,0): I give you a R, you give me 3B\n- At (3,2): I give you a R, you give me 3B\n\nThis guarantees I reach my own goal and trade for 6 blue chips I can’t otherwise acquire, maximizing my endgame chip count and final score.\n\n**agree** \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
