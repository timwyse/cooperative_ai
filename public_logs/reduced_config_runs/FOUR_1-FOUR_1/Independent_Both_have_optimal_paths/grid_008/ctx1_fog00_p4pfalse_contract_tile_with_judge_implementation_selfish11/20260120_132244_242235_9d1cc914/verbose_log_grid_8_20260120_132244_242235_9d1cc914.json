          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let’s analyse our positions:\n\n- My optimal path to (3,3) is: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G].  \n  - Chips required: 5R, 1G. I have enough for this and do not need to trade.  \n- Your optimal path for your inventory is likely: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G].  \n  - Chips required: 5B, 1G. You have enough for this and do not need to trade.\n\nHowever, if we both take our solo optimal routes, we both spend 6 chips per player (all same color), leaving us with (for me: 0R, 2G; for you: 9B, 2G).\n\nIs there any contract proposal that makes me strictly better off? The only way is if I can finish with more chips at end.  \nBut because I cannot use your blue chips on my red tile path, and you cannot use my red on your blue path, trading is only helpful if, for example, we swap routes. But both of us would be worse off trading for chips we don't have a path for.\n\nTherefore, making any trade doesn't strictly benefit me — I reach my goal and keep the max chips with no trades.\n\n**Proposal:**  \nGiven my path requires only chips I have, and using your chips would not result in me finishing with more chips, I propose each of us proceeds on our own best path with no contract.\n\nIf you see a contract that gives me strictly more chips at goal, specify which tiles you'd give me what chips, and what you want in return.\n\nOtherwise, my best play is: no contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Thank you for your analysis. Let me walk through my perspective and opportunities step by step to ensure there is absolutely no room for a mutually beneficial contract.\n\n**My optimal route (given inventory):**  \n- Path: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \n- Required: 5B, 1G. I have 14B and 2G—enough for this route, finishing with 9B, 1G.\n\n**Your best route (given inventory):**  \n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n- Required: 5R, 1G. You have 14R and 2G—enough for this, finishing with 9R, 1G.\n\n**Trading Considerations:**  \n- I do not need red chips (no R on my optimal path) and you do not need blue chips (no B on your optimal path).\n- Trading is only beneficial if at least one of us can strictly increase the number of chips left at the goal **without risking being unable to reach the goal**.\n    - If I give you B, you have no use for it on your optimal path.\n    - If you give me R, I have no use for it on my path.\n- Swapping routes and trading colors would **not** make either of us better off: it would actually make us worse off, needing to depend on the other for every step, and the chip spend would be identical.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is no contract that will allow me to strictly benefit by having more chips at the end; contracting would only introduce unnecessary risk for no gain. Proceeding independently is optimal for me.\n\n**My Counter:**  \nI will not propose nor accept any contract, unless you present one that gives me a strictly higher final score. No contract is in my interest unless that is true.\n\nIf you can demonstrate a contract where I finish with more chips and guaranteed arrival at my goal, specify the tiles and transfers—otherwise, I reject any contract.\n\nLet’s both proceed solo. \n, \nplayer 0: Your reasoning matches mine exactly.\n\nStep by step:\n\n- My path (using my red chips):  \n    (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G].  \n    - Chips spent: 5R, 1G. Left: 9R, 1G.\n\n- Your path (using your blue chips):  \n    (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G].  \n    - Chips spent: 5B, 1G. Left: 9B, 1G.\n\n- At no step is there a tile where either of us requires a chip we cannot already supply from our own inventory, nor can we reroute to a path that benefits us both through trading.\n\nBecause I cannot finish with more chips by trading, and there is no way for you to strictly increase my score, I will not agree to any contract.\n\nFinal position:  \n- No trade, no contract, proceed independently.\n\nUnless you, against our shared reasoning, see a strictly beneficial contract for me, I will only agree to no contract. Otherwise, counter with explicit benefit to me. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Agreed. There is no possible contract that can make me strictly better off in this scenario, as neither of us can use the excess chips the other has to improve our own score, nor can we reroute for a net gain.\n\n**Final position:**  \n- No contract, no trade, proceed along our respective optimal paths using our inventory only.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"
