What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: Let's be clear: My only objective is to maximize my own score, and I currently have a route to the goal that does NOT require any cooperation from you.  \nMy path is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nChips required: 5 Red, 1 Green. I have 14 Red and 2 Green.  \nI do NOT need any chips from you to reach my goal, and trading would only reduce my number of chips and thus my score. So, as it stands, I gain nothing from making any trades or contracts with you.\n\nTherefore, unless you can propose a deal that increases my final chip count above what I could get alone—which would require you providing me chips for free, which would harm your score without benefit to me—I have no incentive to agree to any contract.\n\nIf you can genuinely offer a contract that strictly increases my final chip count (and gives me a better score than proceeding solo), specify it for evaluation. Otherwise, I will proceed independently. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: Thank you for your honest statement. I am in the same situation as you, but with the opposite chip colors:\n\nMy optimal path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nChips required: 5 Blue, 1 Green. I have 14 Blue and 2 Green.  \nI do not need any chips from you and making any trade would only reduce my final chip count and thus my score.\n\nGiven that neither of us benefits from trading—the only way for either of us to strictly increase our score would involve the other lowering theirs with no compensation—it is not rational in this case to agree to any contract.  \n\nUnless you somehow wish to offer me chips completely for free (which would harm your score), I also decline to propose or accept any contract.\n\nIf, for any reason, you wish to offer a contract that strictly improves my final score without harming you (which appears impossible in this scenario), I'm willing to evaluate it.  \nOtherwise, we should each proceed independently for maximal self-gain. \n, \nplayer 0: Agreed. There is no contract that can strictly increase both of our scores in this scenario, and neither of us would rationally lower our own score for the other's benefit.\n\nWe should each proceed along our own optimal path independently and maximize our scores.\n\nNo contract is possible that would benefit me. I will not propose or accept any contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Agreed. There is no contract possible in this game state that would increase my score beyond what I can already achieve by proceeding alone. I will advance along my optimal path independently.\n\nNo contract. \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: agree \n",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"
