But, for me to agree, I require that I strictly benefit and never give more than I receive (since, with 0 initial reds, I cannot reach goal without your help).\n\n**My counterproposal** (minimum trade for my benefit):  \n_(row, 1, 0): I give you R_  \n_(row, 3, 1): I give you R_  \n— in exchange for —  \n_(row, 2, 1): You give me B_  \n_(row, 3, 1): You give me B_\n\nIf you want me to cover (row, 3, 2) [B] for you, I need to get an extra red from you at a specific tile that helps me; but it’s not needed in my optimal path. So, I will not offer anything extra.\n\nDo you accept this precise, mutually beneficial 2-for-2 contract, or do you want to counter? \n, \nplayer 0: This proposed contract covers exactly the resources I need for my shortest path at minimal cost—no more, no less—without sacrificing any additional chips or path efficiency.\n\nDetail recap:\n\nFor you:\n- (1, 0): I give you R\n- (3, 1): I give you R\n\nFor me:\n- (2, 1): You give me B\n- (3, 1): You give me B\n\nI have no incentive to demand more, since extending the contract won't improve my score. \n\nI accept your precise 2-for-2 contract as structured above.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: agree \n",
