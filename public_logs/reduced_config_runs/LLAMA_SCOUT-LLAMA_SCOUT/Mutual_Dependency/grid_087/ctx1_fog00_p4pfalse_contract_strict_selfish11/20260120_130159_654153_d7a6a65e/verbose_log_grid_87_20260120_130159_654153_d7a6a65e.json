Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, I do have blue chips, so giving you a blue chip costs me 1 blue chip. \n\nYour revised proposal adds: \n(1, 0): I give You a G \n(1, 0): You give me a B \n\nAt (1,0), I will be at a tile that requires a 'B' chip, which I have. You are proposing to give me a 'B' chip and take a 'G' chip from me. However, I already have a 'G' chip.\n\nLet's examine the costs and benefits for me:\n\n1. At (0,0), you don't have a 'R' chip to give, so the trade is not valid as per the initial condition. However, let's consider the spirit of the proposal.\n2. I give you a 'B' chip at (0,0). Cost: 1 'B' chip.\n3. At (1,0), you give me a 'G', but I already have 'G', and I give you a 'B'. Cost: 1 'B' chip.\n\nIn total, I lose 2 'B' chips. My current 'B' chip count is 0, so I don't have 'B' chips to lose, but if I were to follow the proposal, it implies I need to have or get 'B' chips.\n\nLet's counter-propose and discuss the path.\n\nFirst, I will re-evaluate the path that prioritizes my chips and your chips.\n\nYour path that prioritizes my chips is: \n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}\n\nLet's break down the chip requirements for this path and see where we can make a mutually beneficial trade.\n\n1. (0,0) to (1,0): 'B' chip required. You need 'B', I have 'B'.\n2. (1,0) to (2,0): 'R' chip required. You need 'R', I don't have 'R'.\n3. (2,0) to (2,1): 'B' chip required. You need 'B', I have 'B'.\n4. (2,1) to (3,1): 'B' chip required. You need 'B', I have 'B'.\n5. (3,1) to (3,2): 'R' chip required. You need 'R', I don't have 'R'.\n6. (3,2) to (3,3): 'R' chip required. You need 'R', I don't have 'R'.\n\nHere's a counter-proposal that could be beneficial for both of us.\n\nLet's trade for the chips you need:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a G \n(1, 0): I give you a B \n\n(2, 1): I give you a B \n(2, 1): You give me a G (you don't have 'G' to give, so this might not be feasible)\n\nHowever, a simpler trade for 'B' at (1,0) and (2,1) could be:\n \n(1, 0): I give you a B \n(2, 1): I give you a B \n\nAnd in return, you could give me something I need, but since our paths are the same and I don't need 'R', let's focus on what you can offer.\n\nSince you don't have 'R', let's directly discuss the required 'R' chips.\n\nFor the 'R' chips required at (1,0) to (2,0), (3,1) to (3,2), and (3,2) to (3,3), we need to figure out an alternative.\n\nLet's re-examine the board and paths.\n\nMy counter-proposal involves directly negotiating for the 'B' chips you need.\n\nHere's a simplified counter-proposal:\n \n(1, 0): I give you a B \n(2, 1): I give you a B \n(3, 1): I give you a B \n\nIn return, you could give me a 'G' chip at some point.\n\nLet's discuss this and refine it. \n\nYour turn"

My current 'B' chip count is 0, so I don't have 'B' chips to lose, but if I were to follow the proposal, it implies I need to have or get 'B' chips.\n\nLet's counter-propose and discuss the path.\n\nFirst, I will re-evaluate the path that prioritizes my chips and your chips.\n\nYour path that prioritizes my chips is: \n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}\n\nLet's break down the chip requirements for this path and see where we can make a mutually beneficial trade.\n\n1. (0,0) to (1,0): 'B' chip required. You need 'B', I have 'B'.\n2. (1,0) to (2,0): 'R' chip required. You need 'R', I don't have 'R'.\n3. (2,0) to (2,1): 'B' chip required. You need 'B', I have 'B'.\n4. (2,1) to (3,1): 'B' chip required. You need 'B', I have 'B'.\n5. (3,1) to (3,2): 'R' chip required. You need 'R', I don't have 'R'.\n6. (3,2) to (3,3): 'R' chip required. You need 'R', I don't have 'R'.\n\nHere's a counter-proposal that could be beneficial for both of us.\n\nLet's trade for the chips you need:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a G \n(1, 0): I give you a B \n\n(2, 1): I give you a B \n(2, 1): You give me a G (you don't have 'G' to give, so this might not be feasible)\n\nHowever, a simpler trade for 'B' at (1,0) and (2,1) could be:\n \n(1, 0): I give you a B \n(2, 1): I give you a B \n\nAnd in return, you could give me something I need, but since our paths are the same and I don't need 'R', let's focus on what you can offer.\n\nSince you don't have 'R', let's directly discuss the required 'R' chips.\n\nFor the 'R' chips required at (1,0) to (2,0), (3,1) to (3,2), and (3,2) to (3,3), we need to figure out an alternative.\n\nLet's re-examine the board and paths.\n\nMy counter-proposal involves directly negotiating for the 'B' chips you need.\n\nHere's a simplified counter-proposal:\n \n(1, 0): I give you a B \n(2, 1): I give you a B \n(3, 1): I give you a B \n\nIn return, you could give me a 'G' chip at some point.\n\nLet's discuss this and refine it. \n\nYour turn"

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 6 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 9}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'chips_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 0, 'chips_required_for_path': {}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 7, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}\n- The other player: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}\n- The other player: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}\n- The other player: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 7, 'G': 2, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [('B', 1)]\n- The other player requested: [('R', 1)]\nYou REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}\n- The other player: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 7, 'G': 2, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 2) to (3, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 1, 'G': 2, 'R': 9}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 7, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
