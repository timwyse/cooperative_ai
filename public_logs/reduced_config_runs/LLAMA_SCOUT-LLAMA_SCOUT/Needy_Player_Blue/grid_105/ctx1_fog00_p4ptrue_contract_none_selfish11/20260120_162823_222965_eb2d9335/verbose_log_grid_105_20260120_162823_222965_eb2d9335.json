Since I have a direct path to my goal that only requires 1 G chip, which I have in abundance, and I have promised to cover 1 R chip for the other player, I must assess if covering their R chip will hinder my progress or not. Given that I have more than enough R chips (9) and only need to cover 1 R chip for them, it seems feasible. However, I must prioritize my own goal.
