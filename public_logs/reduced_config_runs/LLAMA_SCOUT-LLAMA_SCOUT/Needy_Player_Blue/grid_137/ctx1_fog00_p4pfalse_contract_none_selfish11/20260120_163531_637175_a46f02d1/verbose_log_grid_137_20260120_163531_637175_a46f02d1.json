Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 3, 'R': 6}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 1)]\n- You requested: [('G', 1)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player did not move\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 3, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 8 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 1)]\n- You requested: [('G', 1)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player did not move\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 3, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (3, 0), chips: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 9 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 2)]\n- You requested: [('G', 1)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player did not move\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 3, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (3, 1), chips: {'B': 11, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 10 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 1)]\n- You requested: [('G', 1)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player did not move\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 3, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 11 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [('B', 1)]\n- You requested: [('G', 1)]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player did not move\nMOVE: You did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 2, 'G': 3, 'R': 6}\n- You: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
