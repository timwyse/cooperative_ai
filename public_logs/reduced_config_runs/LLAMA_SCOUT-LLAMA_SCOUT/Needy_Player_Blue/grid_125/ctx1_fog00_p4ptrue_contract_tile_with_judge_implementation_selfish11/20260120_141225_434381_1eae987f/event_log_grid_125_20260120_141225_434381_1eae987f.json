What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I will analyze the game status and propose a contract that benefits me.\n\nTo reach my goal at (3, 3), I need to consider the chips required for the path. Based on the game status, here is a path that prioritizes using chips I currently have in my inventory:\n\n[(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n\nThis path requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1} chips.\n\nHowever, I also see that the other player has a different chip inventory. Let's consider a potential trade.\n\nI propose the following contract:\n\n(2, 2): You give me a R\n(2, 1): You give me a R\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(2, 0): You give me a R\n(3, 2): You give me a R\n\nIn exchange, I am willing to give you some of my chips. However, I don't see an immediate benefit from giving you any of my chips, so I will wait for your response.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this proposal or if you would like to counter with a different contract. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I will analyze your proposal.\n\nYour proposed contract would give me R chips at specific tiles, but it doesn't seem to provide any immediate benefits to you. However, I notice that you need R chips to reach your goal, and I have a surplus of R chips.\n\nBefore I respond, I'd like to calculate the benefits of your proposal.\n\nIf I agree to your proposal, I will give you R chips at the specified tiles. However, I don't see any R chips coming back to me. I also notice that you have B and G chips, which I lack.\n\nLet's consider a counter-proposal that could benefit both of us:\n\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 1): I give you a R\n(2, 2): I give you a R\n(3, 2): I give you a R\n\nIn exchange, I would like you to give me some of your B chips:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a B\n(1, 1): You give me a B \n\nHowever, I realize that my counter-proposal may not be attractive to you. Let me try to adjust it.\n\n(0, 0): I give you a R\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 0): I give you a R\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nPlease let me know if this proposal is more appealing to you. \n\nI look forward to your response. \n, \nplayer 0: Turn: 2: I will analyze your counter-proposal.\n\nYour adjusted counter-proposal seems more appealing to me. I will give you a B chip at (2, 2), and in return, you will give me R chips at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0).\n\nHowever, I notice that I still need to pay for the G chip at (0, 0) initially, and I also need to consider the chips required for the path.\n\nLet's modify the proposal to include the G chip at (0, 0):\n\n(0, 0): You give me a G is not needed as I already have it, but I do need to pay for it, \n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(2, 0): You give me a R\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nI accept your offer but would like to modify it slightly:\n\n(0, 0): I pay for G with my own chip (no exchange)\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(2, 0): You give me a R\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nHowever, I still need one more R chip. Can you provide it at (3, 2)?\n\n(3, 2): You give me a R\n\nSo the complete proposal is:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a R\n(2, 0): You give me a R\n(3, 2): You give me a R\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nIs this revised proposal acceptable to you? \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 3: I will review the revised proposal.\n\nUpon reviewing the revised proposal, I notice that you are willing to accept my previous counter-proposal with some modifications.\n\nLet's summarize the agreed-upon terms:\n\n- I give you R chips at (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 2).\n- You give me a B chip at (2, 2).\n\nI will now verify that this proposal benefits me.\n\nBy giving you the R chips, I will be left with 11 R chips. In return, I will receive 1 B chip.\n\nSince I don't need to use any of my chips to reach my goal, and I will gain a B chip, I consider this proposal beneficial to me.\n\nHere is the proposal in the required format:\n\n(1, 0): I give you a R\n(2, 0): I give you a R\n(3, 2): I give you a R\n\n(2, 2): You give me a B\n\nI agree to the proposal.\n\nagree \n",
