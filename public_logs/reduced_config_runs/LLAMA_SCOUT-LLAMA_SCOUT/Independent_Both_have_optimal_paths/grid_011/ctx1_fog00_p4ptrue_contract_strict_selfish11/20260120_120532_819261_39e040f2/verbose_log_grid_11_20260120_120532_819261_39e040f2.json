Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).

The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).

Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it.

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(0,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board? How will it fit with your later moves? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true or false,\n  \"move\": <if want_to_move is true, the move in \"r,c\" format (e.g. \"1,2\"); if want_to_move is false, this should be an empty string \"\">\n}\nExamples of valid moves\n\nExample 1:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"i am at (0, 0).  \nmy goal is at (3, 3).  \nin my inventory I have: {'R': 13, 'G': 2, 'B': 0}\n, \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires just one resource that I don't have \ncorresponding tile colours for each step:  \nrow 0: (0,0) = g (starting spot), (1,0) = r, (2,0) = b  (2,1) = r, (3,1)=r, (3,2)=r, (3,3)=g seems like a good plan. \n\nfirst step: move to (1,0), which is colour **r**.  \ni have **13** red chips.\n\ncheck other adjacent moves from (0,0) to be safe: \n(0,1) = b, which I don't have any of, so let's stick with my first plan, moving to (1,0).\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"1,0\"\n  }\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (0,0) and my goal is (3,3).

A direct path to the goal is along the top row (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). Each of (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) are blue tiles, and with 13 B chips I can easily pay for each move. However (2,3) is a red tile, and I have 0 R chips. Moreover (2,3) is not specified in the contract. My contract covers me for red tiles on (1,0), (2,0), (2, 2) and (3,2). (2, 1) is blue, therefore I can follow an alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which uses only tiles covered by the contract and blue tiles I can pay for.
