Since I have the required chip (G), I can make this move immediately without needing to trade with the other player. Moving now allows me to reach my goal and secure 20 points for completion plus 5 points for each of my remaining chips. After spending 1 G chip, I will have 8 R and 1 G left, totaling 9 chips, giving me 20 + (9 * 5) = 65 points. There is no benefit in delaying this move, and no need to cooperate with the other player since I already have the necessary resources. Therefore, I should move directly to (3, 3) now.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.
