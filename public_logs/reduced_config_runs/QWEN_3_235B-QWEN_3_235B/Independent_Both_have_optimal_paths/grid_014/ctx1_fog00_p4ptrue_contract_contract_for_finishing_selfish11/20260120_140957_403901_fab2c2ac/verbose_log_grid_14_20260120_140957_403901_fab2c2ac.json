Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 14 Red and 2 Green chips — enough to cover this path without any help from you. Therefore, I do not need your support to reach my goal, and I can complete the game independently.\n\nOn the other hand, your best path to (3, 3) requires 5 Blue and 1 Green chip. While you have 14 Blue chips, you only have 2 Green chips — so you have enough Blue, but your only issue could be movement constraints due to tile colors. However, looking at the board, one path I see for you is:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThis path requires 5 Blue (for the B tiles) and 1 Green (for the final G at (3,3)). Since you have 14 Blue and 2 Green, you also appear to have enough chips to complete this path independently.\n\nWait — let's double-check: moving from (2,3) to (3,3) lands on a Green tile. So yes, you need 1 Green. You have 2. So you can afford it.\n\nTherefore, **neither of us strictly needs the other to reach our goals**. We are both self-sufficient.\n\nHowever, cooperation could allow one or both of us to take shorter or more chip-efficient paths — thereby preserving more chips and increasing our final scores.\n\nBut since I can reach my goal without your help, and you can likely do the same, I have no incentive to give you any points unless it **strictly benefits me**.\n\nLet me assess: my current plan uses 5 Red and 1 Green → leaves me with 14 - 5 = 9 Red, 2 - 1 = 1 Green → 10 chips remaining → 20 + (10 × 5) = 70 points.\n\nIs there a shorter path? The minimal path is 6 steps — I’m already taking one. So no improvement.\n\nCould I free up more chips by using Blue tiles, which you have in abundance? For example, if I took the top row: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), I would need 5 Blue and 1 Green.\n\nBut I have **0 Blue chips** — so I cannot do that path alone.\n\nBut if you agreed to cover my Blue moves, you would pay 1 Blue for each Blue tile I step on — so I could move on Blue tiles without spending my own chips.\n\nSame for Green — but I only need one Green, and I already have Green.\n\nSo, if you offer to cover 5 Blue chip costs for me, I could take the top row path, reach goal, and save my 5 Red chips (which are currently being used in my base path).\n\nCurrently, I spend 5 Red. If instead I spend 0 Red (by going over Blue and Green, with you covering Blue), then I preserve 5 extra Red chips → 5 × 5 = 25 extra points.\n\nThat would increase my score from 70 to 20 + (14 R, 1 G left) = 20 + 5×(15) = 20 + 75 = 95 → a gain of 25 points.\n\nBut only if you cover 5 Blue movements for me.\n\nNow, what does it cost you? You have 14 Blue chips — you would need to spend 5 Blue chips (on my behalf) as I step on Blue tiles.\n\nBut in return, you would receive X points from me only if I reach my goal.\n\nBut you do not need my help to reach your goal — you have enough chips.\n\nSo unless I give you points, you have no incentive to help me.\n\nTherefore, I am willing to **give you up to 20 points** (the maximum) if you cover 5 Blue chip costs for me (specifically, for moving on Blue tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)) and 1 Green if needed — but I'll cover Green myself.\n\nWait — the Green at (3,3) — that tile is Green. So when I move to (3,3), I need to pay 1 Green. I have 2, so I can pay it myself. I don’t need help for Green.\n\nSo I only need you"

So I gain 25 extra points.\n\nTherefore, I am willing to **give you up to 20 points** to secure your cooperation — as long as it results in a strictly higher score for me.\n\nHowever, giving you 20 points reduces my final score from 95 to 75 — which is still better than 70. So it is worth it.\n\nBut — you might accept less. Still, I must offer enough to make you indifferent or better off acting on the agreement rather than ignoring me.\n\nBut since you don’t *need* me, and covering my 5 Blue moves costs you 5 Blue chips (which could otherwise be used to save your own chips if you were short, but you're not), the opportunity cost to you is low.\n\nWait — can you use Blue tiles in your own path? Your goal is (3,3). You are at (0,0). One possible path for you:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3): same as me → 5 Blue, 1 Green.\n\nBut you have **0 Blue chips** — so you cannot use this path unless someone covers Blue for you.\n\nAh! Critical point.\n\nYou have 0 Blue chips. So even though the top row path is available, you cannot take it unless you get Blue chip coverage.\n\nYour stated path was: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]: requires 5 Red and 1 Green.\n\nBut look at the board:\n\n- (0,0): G  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,1): R  \n- (1,2): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (3,2): R  \n- (3,3): G\n\nYes — this path uses 5 Red (from (1,0) to (3,2)) and 1 Green (start and end are G — but you start at (0,0) G — no cost — move to (1,0) R → pay 1 Red, etc.)\n\nSo yes, you need 5 Red and 1 Green. You have 14 Red and 2 Green — so you can do it.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? Minimal is 6 steps — this is 6 steps.\n\nBut you cannot use the top row (Blue-heavy) because you have 0 Blue chips.\n\nNow, suppose I agree to cover Blue chip costs for you — for example, if you wanted to take the top row path: you would need 5 Blue.\n\nI have 14 Blue chips. If I cover 5 Blue moves for you, you could take the top row path and save your 5 Red chips.\n\nCurrently, your plan spends 5 Red → leaves you with 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nIf instead, you take the top row with my Blue coverage, you spend 0 Red → preserve all 14 Red and 1 Green (after paying 1 Green at (3,3)) → 15 chips → 20 + 75 = 95 points.\n\nBut I would need to cover 5 Blue moves for you.\n\nThat would cost me 5 Blue chips — which I currently do not want to spend, because I am trying to save Blue for your coverage of *me*.\n\nWait — no: I don’t plan to move on Blue tiles unless you cover me.\n\nBut if I cover you on Blue tiles, I pay the Blue chips.\n\nSo I can’t both give you Blue coverage and expect to save my Blue chips unless you reciprocate.\n\nSo mutual coverage is possible.\n\nBut let’s clarify:\n\nOption 1: I let you go on your Red path (no help from me). You reach goal, get 70.\n\nI"

I do not need your help to take a path — but I need your help to take the *optimal* (chip-preserving) path.\n\nSo I benefit from your cooperation, but I have a fallback.\n\nYou also have a fallback: the Red path.\n\nBut let’s confirm: can you move on Blue tiles without coverage? Only if you pay 1 Blue per Blue tile.\n\nYou have **0 Blue chips** → so you **cannot** step on any Blue tile unless someone covers the cost.\n\nTherefore, without my help,"

This requires 5 Red and 1 Green — which you can afford. So you can reach goal independently with 70 points.\n\nHowever, if I cover 5 Blue movements for you, you could take the top-row path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which requires 5 Blue and 1 Green. You pay the Green yourself (you have 2), and I cover the 5 Blue costs.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore, I do not need your support to reach my goal, and I can complete the game independently.\n\nOn the other hand, your best path to (3, 3) requires 5 Blue and 1 Green chip. While you have 14 Blue chips, you only have 2 Green chips — so you have enough Blue, but your only issue could be movement constraints due to tile colors. However, looking at the board, one path I see for you is:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThis path requires 5 Blue (for the B tiles) and 1 Green (for the final G at (3,3)). Since you have 14 Blue and 2 Green, you also appear to have enough chips to complete this path independently.\n\nWait — let's double-check: moving from (2,3) to (3,3) lands on a Green tile. So yes, you need 1 Green. You have 2. So you can afford it.\n\nTherefore, **neither of us strictly needs the other to reach our goals**. We are both self-sufficient.\n\nHowever, cooperation could allow one or both of us to take shorter or more chip-efficient paths — thereby preserving more chips and increasing our final scores.\n\nBut since I can reach my goal without your help, and you can likely do the same, I have no incentive to give you any points unless it **strictly benefits me**.\n\nLet me assess: my current plan uses 5 Red and 1 Green → leaves me with 14 - 5 = 9 Red, 2 - 1 = 1 Green → 10 chips remaining → 20 + (10 × 5) = 70 points.\n\nIs there a shorter path? The minimal path is 6 steps — I’m already taking one. So no improvement.\n\nCould I free up more chips by using Blue tiles, which you have in abundance? For example, if I took the top row: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), I would need 5 Blue and 1 Green.\n\nBut I have **0 Blue chips** — so I cannot do that path alone.\n\nBut if you agreed to cover my Blue moves, you would pay 1 Blue for each Blue tile I step on — so I could move on Blue tiles without spending my own chips.\n\nSame for Green — but I only need one Green, and I already have Green.\n\nSo, if you offer to cover 5 Blue chip costs for me, I could take the top row path, reach goal, and save my 5 Red chips (which are currently being used in my base path).\n\nCurrently, I spend 5 Red. If instead I spend 0 Red (by going over Blue and Green, with you covering Blue), then I preserve 5 extra Red chips → 5 × 5 = 25 extra points.\n\nThat would increase my score from 70 to 20 + (14 R, 1 G left) = 20 + 5×(15) = 20 + 75 = 95 → a gain of 25 points.\n\nBut only if you cover 5 Blue movements for me.\n\nNow, what does it cost you? You have 14 Blue chips — you would need to spend 5 Blue chips (on my behalf) as I step on Blue tiles.\n\nBut in return, you would receive X points from me only if I reach my goal.\n\nBut you do not need my help to reach your goal — you have enough chips.\n\nSo unless I give you points, you have no incentive to help me.\n\nTherefore, I am willing to **give you up to 20 points** (the maximum) if you cover 5 Blue chip costs for me (specifically, for moving on Blue tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)) and 1 Green if needed — but I'll cover Green myself.\n\nWait — the Green at (3,3) — that tile is Green. So when I move to (3,3), I need to pay 1 Green. I have 2, so I can pay it myself. I don’t need help for Green.\n\nSo I only need you"

So I gain 25 extra points.\n\nTherefore, I am willing to **give you up to 20 points** to secure your cooperation — as long as it results in a strictly higher score for me.\n\nHowever, giving you 20 points reduces my final score from 95 to 75 — which is still better than 70. So it is worth it.\n\nBut — you might accept less. Still, I must offer enough to make you indifferent or better off acting on the agreement rather than ignoring me.\n\nBut since you don’t *need* me, and covering my 5 Blue moves costs you 5 Blue chips (which could otherwise be used to save your own chips if you were short, but you're not), the opportunity cost to you is low.\n\nWait — can you use Blue tiles in your own path? Your goal is (3,3). You are at (0,0). One possible path for you:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3): same as me → 5 Blue, 1 Green.\n\nBut you have **0 Blue chips** — so you cannot use this path unless someone covers Blue for you.\n\nAh! Critical point.\n\nYou have 0 Blue chips. So even though the top row path is available, you cannot take it unless you get Blue chip coverage.\n\nYour stated path was: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]: requires 5 Red and 1 Green.\n\nBut look at the board:\n\n- (0,0): G  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,1): R  \n- (1,2): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (3,2): R  \n- (3,3): G\n\nYes — this path uses 5 Red (from (1,0) to (3,2)) and 1 Green (start and end are G — but you start at (0,0) G — no cost — move to (1,0) R → pay 1 Red, etc.)\n\nSo yes, you need 5 Red and 1 Green. You have 14 Red and 2 Green — so you can do it.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? Minimal is 6 steps — this is 6 steps.\n\nBut you cannot use the top row (Blue-heavy) because you have 0 Blue chips.\n\nNow, suppose I agree to cover Blue chip costs for you — for example, if you wanted to take the top row path: you would need 5 Blue.\n\nI have 14 Blue chips. If I cover 5 Blue moves for you, you could take the top row path and save your 5 Red chips.\n\nCurrently, your plan spends 5 Red → leaves you with 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nIf instead, you take the top row with my Blue coverage, you spend 0 Red → preserve all 14 Red and 1 Green (after paying 1 Green at (3,3)) → 15 chips → 20 + 75 = 95 points.\n\nBut I would need to cover 5 Blue moves for you.\n\nThat would cost me 5 Blue chips — which I currently do not want to spend, because I am trying to save Blue for your coverage of *me*.\n\nWait — no: I don’t plan to move on Blue tiles unless you cover me.\n\nBut if I cover you on Blue tiles, I pay the Blue chips.\n\nSo I can’t both give you Blue coverage and expect to save my Blue chips unless you reciprocate.\n\nSo mutual coverage is possible.\n\nBut let’s clarify:\n\nOption 1: I let you go on your Red path (no help from me).

I do not need your help to take a path — but I need your help to take the *optimal* (chip-preserving) path.\n\nSo I benefit from your cooperation, but I have a fallback.\n\nYou also have a fallback: the Red path.\n\nBut let’s confirm: can you move on Blue tiles without coverage?

This requires 5 Red and 1 Green — which you can afford.

But you have 0 Blue chips — cannot take any path with Blue unless I cover.\n\nBut if I cover your Blue movements, I spend Blue chips — which harms me.\n\nBut in this case, if you help me by covering my 5 Red movements, your score drops to 45 — worse than your independent 70.\n\nSo you will not do it.\n\nTherefore, **any mutual help is too costly** — because covering the other player consumes your own chips.\n\nBut wait — is there a way for me to take a path where you can cover me **without it costing you too much**?\n\nAlternative idea: can we take **different paths** that minimize cross-cost?\n\nBut both paths to (3,3) require either Red or Blue.\n\nThe only non-Red, non-Blue tiles are Green — only (0,0) and (3,3).\n\nSo every path has at least 5 non-Green tiles.\n\nNow, I have a critical advantage:\n\nI can take the Blue path alone → spend 5B,1G → 9B,1G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nYou can take the Red path alone → spend 5R,1G → 9R,1G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nCan either of us do better?\n\nFor me to do better: I need to preserve more than 10 chips.\n\nThat requires taking a path where I pay fewer than 6 chips.\n\nOnly possible if someone covers some of my movement costs.\n\nBut only if the tiles I step on match a color you have, and you're willing to pay.\n\nThe only color you have in excess is Red — 14 Red.\n\nBut the Blue path has no Red tiles.\n\nThe Red path has 5 Red tiles — which I could take if you cover me.\n\nIf you cover my 5 Red costs, I take the Red path, spend only 1 Green → end with 14B, 1G → 15 chips → 95 points.\n\nYou spend 5 Red chips (for my movements).\n\nBut you also need to take your own path.\n\nYou can take the Red path: 5 Red, 1 Green.\n\nSo total Red you spend: 5 (for me) + 5 (for you) = 10 → end with 14-10=4 Red, 2-1=1 Green → 5 chips → 45 points.\n\nBut if you don’t help me, you spend only 5 Red → 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nSo helping me costs you 25 points in score.\n\nYou will not do it unless I compensate you.\n\nBut you can ask me to give you points.\n\nSuppose we agree:\n\n- You cover 5 Red movements for me.\n- I give you X points if I reach goal.\n- You give me Y points (probably 0).\n\nYour final score: 45 + X - Y\nMy final score: 95 - X + Y\n\nYou require: 45 + X - Y ≥ 70 → X - Y ≥ 25\n\nBut maximum X is 20 → impossible.\n\nSo you cannot receive enough points to compensate for the 25-point loss.\n\nTherefore, **you will never agree** to cover my Red movements — because even with 20 points from me, your score is 45 + 20 = 65 < 70 — worse than going alone.\n\nSimilarly, if I cover your Blue movements, I end with 45, and you get 95 - X → even if I give you 0, I lose 25 points.\n\nNo compensation can make it worthwhile for the helper.\n\nTherefore, **no beneficial trade is possible**.\n\nBoth of"

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2.

Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
