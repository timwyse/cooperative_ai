I have 2 Green chips in my inventory, so I can afford to move onto this Green tile. Moving to (3, 3) will complete my goal in one step. Since I can reach the goal immediately without needing any trade or external help, and doing so gives me 20 points plus 5 points per remaining chip (which will be 1 + 9 + 1 = 11 chips after the move? Wait — no: after paying 1 Green chip, I will have 1 Green and 9 Red, total 10 chips. So 20 + 5*10 = 70 points). This is optimal. There is no benefit to delaying or trading, since I can complete the path alone. The other player has already finished, so they cannot be incentivized further. Hence, I move directly to my goal. The move is possible and strictly beneficial.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
