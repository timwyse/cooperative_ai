This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points.

The tile at (1,0) is 'B' (blue), and I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford to move there. Moving to (1,0) is the first step along a safe path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 5 blue and 1 green — all of which I can cover. Although there is a shorter path of length 5 that uses 4 red and 1 green, I do not have any red chips and would need to trade with the other player to access it. Since I'm a selfish agent and care only about my own score, I will not trade unless it strictly benefits me. Moving along the blue-heavy path avoids dependency on red chips and keeps me self-sufficient. Thus, moving to (1,0) is safe, low-cost, and maintains progress toward my goal without needing cooperation. I make this move to preserve autonomy and ensure I reach the goal with maximum remaining chips.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n- The other player: at (2, 0), chips: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 0) to (2, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 1), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}\n- The other player: at (2, 1), chips: {'B': 11, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 1) to (1, 2)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 1) to (2, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 2), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 11}\n- The other player: at (2, 2), chips: {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 2) to (1, 3)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (1, 3), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}\n- The other player: at (3, 2), chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3)\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 2) to (3, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (2, 3), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 9}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, chips: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
