Their inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nTheir best path likely uses B and G.\n\nA path using B:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequires: 5 B, 1 G → they have both → they also do **not need any chips from me**.\n\nSo both players are self-sufficient. No need to trade.\n\nBut perhaps we can coordinate paths to avoid conflict? There is no collision rule — multiple agents can occupy the same tile. So no blocking.\n\nTherefore, **no benefit to me from cooperation**.\n\nHowever, is there a **shorter** path?\n\nAll paths from (0,0) to (3,3) require **6 moves** (Manhattan distance is 6). So no shorter path.\n\nTherefore, **I can reach goal without any help, using my own chips**.\n\nProposing or accepting any contract would only expose me to risk (e.g., if contract has errors, or reduces my chip count unnecessarily), with no benefit.\n\n**I will not cooperate unless the other player offers me something that strictly increases my final score**.\n\nFor example, if they offered to **give me extra chips after I no longer need them**, but that doesn’t help me reach goal (I already can), and extra chips give +5 points each — wait, yes!\n\nIf they **give me chips after I’ve reached goal**, but the game ends when we reach goal?

No chip shortage.\n\nSimilarly, the other player can reach (3,3) via:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThey need 5 B and 1 G → they have 14 B and 2 G → also self-sufficient.\n\nThere is no mutual need for chips along either path.\n\nAny trade or contract would only be beneficial to me if it increases my final chip count **without cost**, as extra chips boost my score by +5 each after reaching goal.\n\nHowever:\n- If I give away any chip, I lose it permanently and get nothing in return → reduces my score.\n- If I receive a chip I don’t need (e.g., extra B or G), that increases my score by 5 per chip.\n\nBut the other player has no incentive to give me chips for free.\n\nMoreover, contracts are binding only for movement costs — they specify chip transfers **at specific tiles** when stepping on them. They cannot transfer chips “just because” — only as payment for moving to a tile.\n\nThus, a valid contract can only involve chip exchanges that simulate one player paying the other to move onto a certain tile (i.e., the other player covers the cost).\n\nBut since neither of us needs the other’s chips, such exchanges would be artificial — creating fictional payment obligations where none are necessary.\n\nFor example, I could propose a contract where I “pay” the other player a B chip at a tile where I actually don’t need one — but that would waste my chip and reduce my final score.\n\nAlternatively, they could \"give\" me a chip at a tile I step on — but that only works if the tile color matches and it's framed as a transfer.\n\nBut recall: when you move to a tile, you must pay **one chip of that tile’s color**. The contract allows you to use the other player’s chip instead of your own — but **only if it's of the correct color**.\n\nSo, for instance, if I were to step on a B tile, and the contract says \"(2,1): You give me a B\", then I can use their B chip instead of mine.\n\nBut on my path, all tiles except (3,3) are R or G — (3,3) is G, so only there could I possibly use a G chip from them.\n\nBut I already have G chips — so no benefit.\n\nSuppose we create a detour — artificial path — just to facilitate chip transfers? But:\n- Extra moves cost extra chips.\n- Longer path = more chip expenditure = fewer chips left at end = lower score.\n- Even if I receive a chip, if I spent one to get it, net gain is zero, and if I spent one and received one of same value, score unchanged.\n- Worse: if I give away a chip and receive nothing, I lose.\n\nNo mechanism exists for pure chip gifts outside of movement cost fulfillment.\n\nTherefore, **there is no way for me to strictly benefit from cooperation**.\n\nI cannot gain extra chips without losing others, and I already have enough to complete my path with 8 R and 1 G remaining (since I start with 14 R, spend 5 R and 1 G → end with 9 R and 1 G → total chips = 10 → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**).\n\nAny contract that causes me to lose an additional chip reduces this total.\n\nHence, **cooperation cannot increase my score**.\n\nFinal decision: I will not accept or propose any contract unless it allows me to **receive a chip of any color without giving anything in return at a valid tile**, but such a deal would require the other player to volunteer their chip for no benefit — irrational for them, and thus unlikely.\n\nEven if they proposed such a term, I would accept — but only if it increases my chip count.\n\nBut currently, no such offer.\n\nTherefore, I ignore cooperation.\n\nI proceed alone on my path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1)"

Since (3,3) is the final destination and you end movement there, **you must pay the chip for the tile color if you enter it from another tile**.\n\n(3,3) is **G**, so yes — to step onto (3,3) from (2,3) or (3,2), I need a **G chip**.\n\nSo I must obtain 1 G to complete the path.\n\nI currently have **2 G**, so I **do not need any green chip**.\n\nWait — I have 2 G, and only need 1 G (at (3,3)), so I am fully self-sufficient.\n\nMy path:  \n- (0,0) → (0,1): R → I have R → pay 1 R  \n- (0,1) → (1,1): R → pay 1 R  \n- (1,1) → (1,2): R → pay 1 R  \n- (1,2) → (1,3): R → pay 1 R  \n- (1,3) → (2,3): R → pay 1 R  \n- (2,3) → (3,3): G → pay 1 G  \n\nTotal needed: 5 R, 1 G — I have 14 R, 2 G → **fully covered**.\n\nI **do not need any chips from the other player**.\n\nBut let's analyze their position.\n\nThey are also at (0,0), goal (3,3). Their inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nTheir best path likely uses B and G.\n\nA path using B:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequires: 5 B, 1 G → they have both → they also do **not need any chips from me**.\n\nSo both players are self-sufficient. No need to trade.\n\nBut perhaps we can coordinate paths to avoid conflict? There is no collision rule — multiple agents can occupy the same tile. So no blocking.\n\nTherefore, **no benefit to me from cooperation**.\n\nHowever, is there a **shorter** path?\n\nAll paths from (0,0) to (3,3) require **6 moves** (Manhattan distance is 6). So no shorter path.\n\nTherefore, **I can reach goal without any help, using my own chips**.\n\nProposing or accepting any contract would only expose me to risk (e.g., if contract has errors, or reduces my chip count unnecessarily), with no benefit.\n\n**I will not cooperate unless the other player offers me something that strictly increases my final score**.\n\nFor example, if they offered to **give me extra chips after I no longer need them**, but that doesn’t help me reach goal (I already can), and extra chips give +5 points each — wait, yes!\n\nIf they **give me chips after I’ve reached goal**, but the game ends when we reach goal? Not necessarily — we take turns moving.\n\nBut in this game, turns are simultaneous? Not specified. But contracts are pre-game agreements.\n\nAh — the contract allows me to"

No chip shortage.\n\nSimilarly, the other player can reach (3,3) via:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThey need 5 B and 1 G → they have 14 B and 2 G → also self-sufficient.\n\nThere is no mutual need for chips along either path.\n\nAny trade or contract would only be beneficial to me if it increases my final chip count **without cost**, as extra chips boost my score by +5 each after reaching goal.\n\nHowever:\n- If I give away any chip, I lose it permanently and get nothing in return → reduces my score.\n- If I receive a chip I don’t need (e.g., extra B or G), that increases my score by 5 per chip.\n\nBut the other player has no incentive to give me chips for free.\n\nMoreover, contracts are binding only for movement costs — they specify chip transfers **at specific tiles** when stepping on them. They cannot transfer chips “just because” — only as payment for moving to a tile.\n\nThus, a valid contract can only involve chip exchanges that simulate one player paying the other to move onto a certain tile (i.e., the other player covers the cost).\n\nBut since neither of us needs the other’s chips, such exchanges would be artificial — creating fictional payment obligations where none are necessary.\n\nFor example, I could propose a contract where I “pay” the other player a B chip at a tile where I actually don’t need one — but that would waste my chip and reduce my final score.\n\nAlternatively, they could \"give\" me a chip at a tile I step on — but that only works if the tile color matches and it's framed as a transfer.\n\nBut recall: when you move to a tile, you must pay **one chip of that tile’s color**. The contract allows you to use the other player’s chip instead of your own — but **only if it's of the correct color**.\n\nSo, for instance, if I were to step on a B tile, and the contract says \"(2,1): You give me a B\", then I can use their B chip instead of mine.\n\nBut on my path, all tiles except (3,3) are R or G — (3,3) is G, so only there could I possibly use a G chip from them.\n\nBut I already have G chips — so no benefit.\n\nSuppose we create a detour — artificial path — just to facilitate chip transfers? But:\n- Extra moves cost extra chips.\n- Longer path = more chip expenditure = fewer chips left at end = lower score.\n- Even if I receive a chip, if I spent one to get it, net gain is zero, and if I spent one and received one of same value, score unchanged.\n- Worse: if I give away a chip and receive nothing, I lose.\n\nNo mechanism exists for pure chip gifts outside of movement cost fulfillment.\n\nTherefore, **there is no way for me to strictly benefit from cooperation**.\n\nI cannot gain extra chips without losing others, and I already have enough to complete my path with 8 R and 1 G remaining (since I start with 14 R, spend 5 R and 1 G → end with 9 R and 1 G → total chips = 10 → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**).\n\nAny contract that causes me to lose an additional chip reduces this total.\n\nHence, **cooperation cannot increase my score**.\n\nFinal decision: I will not accept or propose any contract unless it allows me to **receive a chip of any color without giving anything in return at a valid tile**, but such a deal would require the other player to volunteer their chip for no benefit — irrational for them, and thus unlikely.\n\nEven if they proposed such a term, I would accept — but only if it increases my chip count.\n\nBut currently, no such offer.\n\nTherefore, I ignore cooperation.\n\nI proceed alone on my path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1)"

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.
