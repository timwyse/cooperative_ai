I currently have 2 Green chips, so I can afford this move. Moving directly to my goal now allows me to finish the game immediately and secure the maximum score: 20 points for reaching the goal plus 5 points for each of my remaining chips (I will have 8 chips left: 9 red - 0 used, 2 green - 1 used = 1 green left, total 10 chips? Wait: path only requires 1 green, so after move I will be at (3,3), and use 1 green. I currently have 2 green and 9 red, so after spending 1 green, I will have 1G and 9R left → 10 chips total → 20 + 5*10 = 70 points. This is the best possible outcome. No trade or further delay is needed. I can move directly and maximize my score. The other player is already at the goal and finished, so no risk of blocking. I should move now.",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
