Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

This means I can easily walk on Red tiles, but cannot step on Blue without help. You have the opposite problem.\n\nLooking at the shortest paths:\n- My ideal path: Moving down the leftmost column — (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This requires **5 Red and 1 Green** — I can cover all of it except the Green tile at the end. I already have the Red chips. I only need help with 1 Green.\n- Your ideal path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). This requires **5 Blue and 1 Green** — you have the Blue, but like me, you need Green help.\n\nBut here's the key asymmetry:  \nI have **2 Green** chips. You have **0 Green**. That means:\n- I can reach my goal with minimal external help. I can even afford to help you with Green if it benefits me.\n- You **cannot** take any path requiring Green without my help.\n\nMoreover, if I do nothing and just go straight down the left column, I only need to pay 1 Green chip at (3,3). I have 2 — so I can do it solo and finish with 13 Red and 1 Green chip left. That gives me:  \n20 (goal) + 5×(13+1+0) = 20 + 5×14 = **90 points**.\n\nBut if we cooperate and I cover your Green cost, you could potentially reach your goal — and if you agree to pay me points in return, I might do even better.\n\nHowever, if you don’t reach your goal, **you get 0**, and **your promised points to me are worthless**.\n\nSo for me to even consider helping you, you must give me **maximum possible incentive**.\n\nBut let’s reverse it: Do you need **me**? Yes — because without my Green chip, you cannot step on (3,3), which is Green. You need **at least 1 Green** to finish. And I have it.\n\nI don’t need you at all to reach my goal — I can pay for my own Red tiles, and I have 2 Green chips. The only tile I can't pay for is Blue, but my path doesn't require Blue.\n\nTherefore, you need me more than I need you.\n\nThat said, I could allow you to reach your goal by covering your Green cost — but only if you give me **maximum return**.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n\nThat’s the only deal I benefit from. Otherwise, I go alone, get 90, and you get 0.\n\nBut if you accept, you get 20 (goal) + 5×(your remaining chips) — still better than 0. And I get 20 (goal) + 5×(my remaining chips) + 20 (from you) = even more.\n\nThis trade is one-sided because the power is one-sided.\n\nI don’t need your Blue coverage — my path uses Red and one Green. I can walk it solo. But you **must** have a Green chip to step on (3,3). Only I can help you by agreeing to cover that cost.\n\nSo unless you offer **maximum return to me**, I won’t help.\n\nI propose:\n- I will cover **1 Green** chip for you, only if you step on (3,3) and only if our contract is binding.\n- You will give me 20 points if you reach your goal.\n- I give you 0.\n\nThat is fair in terms of value: you gain everything (your entire score), I risk nothing.\n\n**agree**"
