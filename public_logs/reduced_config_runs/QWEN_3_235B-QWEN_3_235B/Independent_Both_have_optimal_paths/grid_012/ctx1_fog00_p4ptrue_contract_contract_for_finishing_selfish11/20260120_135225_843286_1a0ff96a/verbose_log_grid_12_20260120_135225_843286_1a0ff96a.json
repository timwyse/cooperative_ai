Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have plenty of blue chips (B:14) and no red, while I have lots of red (R:14) and only a few green. \n\nLooking at the board and our starting positions:\n\n- My ideal path to (3,3) is:  \n  (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  This requires **5 red** and **1 green**. I have more than enough red and exactly enough green. I can do this path *without any help* from you.\n\n- Your ideal path likely goes through the top row:  \n  (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n  This requires **5 blue** and **1 green**. You have 14 blue, so you can also take this path *on your own*.\n\nSo both of us can reach the goal independently. But that means *neither of us strictly needs the other*—unless we want to preserve extra chips to increase our score.\n\nCurrently, I can reach the goal using only 5 red and 1 green. Since I start with 14 red, I’d have 9 red left over. That’s 20 (goal) + 5*(10) = **70 points**.  \nYou would spend 5 blue and 1 green, leave 9 blue, so 20 + 5*(10) = **70 points**.\n\nBut consider a *shorter* or *more chip-efficient* path? There isn’t a path shorter than 6 moves. But maybe we can help each other *save* chips by taking alternative paths that use more of the color the other player has surplus in.\n\nHowever, the key point is: **I don’t need your help to reach my goal, and you don’t need mine**—we each have the chips required for a valid path.\n\nTherefore, any cooperation only makes sense if it *increases* my final chip count beyond what I can achieve alone.\n\nBut in this case, since I can already reach the goal and keep 9 red and 1 green (10 chips total), there’s no way for *you* to help me save *more* than that. Any path I take requires at least 6 chips, and I am already paying only 6 (5R + 1G), so I’m already minimizing cost.\n\nThe same goes for you.\n\nSo **neither of us can offer real value to the other**—we are already at our optimal self-sufficient outcome.\n\nTherefore, I have no incentive to give you any points.\n\nBut to formalize a contract anyway (as required):\n\nIf you reach your goal, I will give you **0** points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **0** points.\n\nBecause you provide no benefit to me, and I gain nothing from transferring points.\n\nHowever, this is not hostile—it just reflects the game state: **no mutual benefit possible**.\n\n**agree**"

I will finish with at least 9 B and 1 G remaining — 10 chips total — giving me a final score of 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nIf I were to deviate from this path to one that uses more red tiles (which you have in surplus), I would only do so if it results in *me* preserving *more* chips than I currently can — meaning a path that costs fewer than 6 chips total. But no such path exists — all paths to (3,3) are at least 6 steps.\n\nMoreover, even if we coordinated on a shared alternate route, I would still be spending 6 chips (unless you *covered* some of my costs). But covering movement is costly for *you* only if it helps *you* in return — and as you said, you don’t need any help.\n\nNow consider this: suppose I propose to cover some of your red costs so you save red chips — but that doesn't increase your final chip count beyond what you already achieve on your own path. You already spend only 6 chips (5R + 1G) and keep 9R and 1G. So you cannot save more than that — same for me.\n\nThus, **there is no possible trade or cooperation that increases either of our final chip counts beyond 10**.\n\nTherefore, no incentive exists to transfer points to you upon my success — because I gain nothing from you.\n\nFurthermore, I gain nothing if you reach your goal — it doesn’t preserve my chips or help my score in any way.\n\nHence, the only rational contract — from a strictly self-interested standpoint — is:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **0** points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **0** points.\n\nThis reflects the absence of mutual benefit.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
