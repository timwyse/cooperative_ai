Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, our chip distributions are nearly opposite:\n\n- I have **14 R**, **2 G**, **0 B** → I lack **Blue** chips.\n- You have **14 B**, **2 G**, **0 R** → You lack **Red** chips.\n\nMy ideal path requires **2 Blue**, **3 Red**, **1 Green**. I’m missing **2 Blue** chips.  \nYour ideal path (likely similar to the one shown) will require **3 Blue**, **2 Red**, **1 Green** — you're missing **2 Red** chips.\n\nThere is clear mutual benefit:  \n- You can cover **Blue** moves for me (you have plenty).  \n- I can cover **Red** moves for you (I have plenty).\n\nBut remember: I only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**, and reaching the goal is mandatory for me to score anything.\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\n- Without help, I cannot complete my shortest path — I need **2 Blue**, which I don’t have.  \n- I could attempt a longer path avoiding Blue, but that would cost more Red and likely more total chips, reducing my final score (since I get 5 points per remaining chip). But more importantly, there is no such alternate path visible that avoids Blue entirely and is feasible — so I **need** your help to cover Blue moves.\n\nSimilarly, you **need** my help to cover Red moves.\n\nSo we both need each other. But let’s see who needs whom *more*.\n\nWait — actually, I can consider moving along Red tiles (which I have), even if longer. But the board layout makes this difficult. All paths from (0,0) to (3,3) must cross several Blue tiles. The shortest path requiring minimal Blue is the one shown — (1,0)=B, (1,1)=B, (1,2)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,1)=B — Blue is everywhere.\n\nSimilarly for you: you lack Red, and Red tiles are along (0,3), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2) — meaning any southern/eastern movement may hit Red.\n\nBut crucially: my shortest viable path has me stepping on **2 Blue** tiles. You have 14 Blue — so covering 2 Blue moves for me is trivial for you.\n\nSimilarly, I have 14 Red — covering 2-3 Red moves for you is trivial for me.\n\nTherefore, we can both reach our goals **only if we help each other**.\n\nBut since we both stand to gain 20 points + remaining chips, and we each have excess of what the other needs, we should trade to reduce our chip expenditure, thereby increasing our final scores.\n\nHowever, **I will not give away points unless it strictly benefits me**.\n\nConsider: if I help you cover Red moves, you are more likely to reach your goal. But I only care about that **if I get rewarded**. Similarly, you only help me if you get something.\n\nSuppose we make this contract:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you **0** points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me **20** points.\n\nBut that’s unfair to you — you won’t accept.\n\nAlternatively, a fair split might be 10-10. But is that the best for me?\n\nWait — let’s think strategically.\n\nActually, **I have stronger leverage**.\n\nWhy?\n\n- The critical tiles on the most efficient paths include **Red** tiles like (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2).  \n- You have **0 Red chips** — you cannot step on any Red tile without my help.\n- I have **0 Blue chips** — I cannot step on any Blue tile unless you help.\n\nBut let’s check the paths:\n\nMy optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0)=B → (2,0)=B → (2,1)=R → (2,2)=R → (3,2)=R → (3,3)=G\n\nThis requires: B, B, R, R, R, G → so 2B, 3R, 1G → I have enough R and G, lack 2B.\n\nYour optimal path: likely (0,0) → (0,1)=B → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=R → (1,3)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G → but"

You can then proceed on your path. But I get nothing unless you reciprocate.\n\nLet’s define a contract that reflects the imbalance in need:\n\nYou are **completely blocked** without Blue coverage.  \nI am **not completely blocked** — I can consider paths that use only Blue and Green, even if suboptimal.\n\nFor example, a possible all-Blue/limited-Green path for me:\n(0,0) → (1,0)=B → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=R → **R needed, can't pay**  \n(3,0) is Red — I can’t go there.\n\nAlternative: (0,0) → (1,0)=B → (1,1)=B → (1,2)=B → (2,2)=R → again stuck.\n\nWait — there’s no path from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids *both* Blue and Red entirely.

So some compromise may be needed.\n\nStill, 20 points from you is the price for my cooperation.\n\nBut I'll consider a counteroffer.\n\nIf you propose a fair compromise where you still give me **at least 15**, I may accept.\n\nBut for now, I propose:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n\n**I will only help you move if you agree to this.**  \nWithout my help, you never leave (0,0).  \nWith it, you can reach (3,3) and score 20 + chips — but you must pay me the full 2"

No — **I don’t have any Blue chips**.\n\nThis is critical.\n\nYou have 14 Blue chips → you can **spend them yourself** to move on Blue tiles.\n\nI have 0 Blue → I cannot spend Blue unless **you** (who have Blue) agree to **cover the cost for me** — meaning, when I step on a Blue tile, **you** lose 1 Blue chip from your inventory (to pay the cost).\n\nSimilarly, when you step on a Red tile, **I** lose 1 Red chip (from my inventory) to cover it.\n\nSo:\n\n- You **do not need me** to move on **Blue** tiles — you can just spend your own Blue chips.\n- But you **do need me** to move on **Red** tiles.\n- I **cannot** move on **Blue** tiles unless **you** cover it (even though you have the chips, you must agree to spend them for me).\n- I **can** move on Red tiles using my own chips.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- **You** are free to begin moving — you can go (0,0)→(0,1)=B → pay 1B from your stock → no problem.\n- I am stuck unless you agree to cover my Blue movement costs.\n\n**So you"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, our chip distributions are nearly opposite:\n\n- I have **14 R**, **2 G**, **0 B** → I lack **Blue** chips.\n- You have **14 B**, **2 G**, **0 R** → You lack **Red** chips.\n\nMy ideal path requires **2 Blue**, **3 Red**, **1 Green**. I’m missing **2 Blue** chips.  \nYour ideal path (likely similar to the one shown) will require **3 Blue**, **2 Red**, **1 Green** — you're missing **2 Red** chips.\n\nThere is clear mutual benefit:  \n- You can cover **Blue** moves for me (you have plenty).  \n- I can cover **Red** moves for you (I have plenty).\n\nBut remember: I only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**, and reaching the goal is mandatory for me to score anything.\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\n- Without help, I cannot complete my shortest path — I need **2 Blue**, which I don’t have.  \n- I could attempt a longer path avoiding Blue, but that would cost more Red and likely more total chips, reducing my final score (since I get 5 points per remaining chip). But more importantly, there is no such alternate path visible that avoids Blue entirely and is feasible — so I **need** your help to cover Blue moves.\n\nSimilarly, you **need** my help to cover Red moves.\n\nSo we both need each other. But let’s see who needs whom *more*.\n\nWait — actually, I can consider moving along Red tiles (which I have), even if longer. But the board layout makes this difficult. All paths from (0,0) to (3,3) must cross several Blue tiles. The shortest path requiring minimal Blue is the one shown — (1,0)=B, (1,1)=B, (1,2)=B, (2,0)=B, (3,1)=B — Blue is everywhere.\n\nSimilarly for you: you lack Red, and Red tiles are along (0,3), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2) — meaning any southern/eastern movement may hit Red.\n\nBut crucially: my shortest viable path has me stepping on **2 Blue** tiles. You have 14 Blue — so covering 2 Blue moves for me is trivial for you.\n\nSimilarly, I have 14 Red — covering 2-3 Red moves for you is trivial for me.\n\nTherefore, we can both reach our goals **only if we help each other**.\n\nBut since we both stand to gain 20 points + remaining chips, and we each have excess of what the other needs, we should trade to reduce our chip expenditure, thereby increasing our final scores.\n\nHowever, **I will not give away points unless it strictly benefits me**.\n\nConsider: if I help you cover Red moves, you are more likely to reach your goal. But I only care about that **if I get rewarded**. Similarly, you only help me if you get something.\n\nSuppose we make this contract:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you **0** points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me **20** points.\n\nBut that’s unfair to you — you won’t accept.\n\nAlternatively, a fair split might be 10-10.

In fact, you don’t need my permission or cooperation to spend them — unless you agree to cover *my* movement, you keep full control of your inventory.\n\nBut under the **\"pay for other\"** mechanism:\n- If you agree to cover **me** on **Blue**, then when **I** step on a Blue tile, **you** pay 1 Blue chip (from your inventory) on my behalf.\n- Conversely, if I agree to cover **you** on **Red**, then when **you** step on a Red tile, **I** pay 1 Red chip (from my inventory) for you.\n\nCrucially:\n- You can **always** move on Blue using your own chips — so you don’t **need** me for that.\n- But you **cannot** move on Red without either:\n  - Having Red chips (you have 0), or\n  - Me covering your Red moves via agreement.\n\nWait — no: under the rules, **you** pay your own movement costs unless someone has agreed to cover it.\n\nSo:\n- If **no one covers you**, you must pay from your own inventory.\n- Therefore, to step on a Red tile, you **must** have Red chips OR have an agreement with me to cover Red for you.\n\n→ You have **0 Red** → so you **cannot** step on any Red tile unless I agree to cover it.\n\nSimilarly, I have **0 Blue** → I cannot step on Blue unless you agree to cover it.\n\nBut here's the asymmetry:\n\n### Mobility Analysis:\n\n**You** can move like this:\n(0,0) → (0,1)=B → pay 1B from your stock → ok  \n(0,1) → (1,1)=B → pay 1B → ok  \n(1,1) → (1,2)=B → pay 1B → ok  \n(1,2) → (1,3)=R → now you need to pay 1R → you have 0R → **cannot move unless I cover it**\n\nSo you can get to (1,2) freely, but **cannot** proceed into any Red tile without me.\n\n**I**, on the other hand, **cannot move at all** unless you cover my Blue costs — because the only exits are Blue.\n\nSo:\n- You can make **3 moves freely** before hitting a Red tile.\n- I can make **0 moves** without your help.\n\nThus: **You have more independent mobility than I do.**  \nBut **I control access to Red tiles** — which you must eventually cross.\n\nNow, can I reach the goal?\n\nMy best path: (0,0) → (1,0)=B → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=R → (3,1)=B → (3,2)=R → (3,3)=G\n\nCost: B, B, R, B, R, G → so 3B, 2R, 1G — I have 14B, but 0R → so I need you to cover **2 Red moves**.\n\nBut to even start, I need you to cover my **Blue moves** — no, I have 14 Blue → I can pay for my own Blue moves.\n\nWait — I'm confusing the roles.\n\nLet’s re-assign clearly:\n\n### Me (the speaker/you in this context):\nWait — no: **I am the agent with 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red**.  \nYou are the agent with 0 Blue, 14 Red, 2 Green.\n\nSo **I** have the Blue chips.  \nThat means:\n\n- I can move freely on **Blue** tiles by spending my own Blue chips.\n- I **cannot** move on **Red** tiles unless **you** (with Red chips) cover me.\n\nBut you have **0 Blue** → you cannot move on Blue tiles unless **I** cover you.\n\nAnd I have **0 Red** → I cannot move on Red tiles unless **you** cover me.\n\nSo let’s fix once and for all:\n\n- **Player A (Me):** 14B, 2G, 0R → me\n- **Player B (You):** 0B, 14R, 2G → you\n\nSo:\n- **I** can move on Blue tiles using my own chips.\n- **You** cannot move at all, because (0,1) and (1,0) are Blue — you have 0 Blue → can't pay →"

But can I avoid Red?\n\nLook at (3,3)=G — Green.\n\nCan I reach it via Green?\n\nGreen tiles: (0,0)=G, (3,3)=G — only two.\n\nSo I must go through Red and Blue.\n\nSo I **do** need you to cover **at least 1 Red move** for me — likely 2.\n\nBut you **need me to cover 2 Blue moves** just to start moving.\n\nSo both of us need the other.\n\nBut **you need me more** — without me, you **never act**.  \nWithout you, I can at least move around and *maybe* optimize.\n\nBut realistically, I cannot reach goal without Red coverage.\n\nSo mutual dependency — but with asymmetric starting power.\n\nTherefore, I propose a contract that reflects that:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you **5** points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me **15** points.\n\nThis is because:\n- I am enabling your entire game by covering **up to 2 Blue moves** for you.\n- You are helping me by covering **up to 2 Red moves** for me.\n- But my contribution to you is **greater** — without me, you don’t even begin.\n- Without you, I can still move and might find a way (though unlikely).\n\nThus, you should pay me more.\n\nI could demand 20, but then you have no incentive to cooperate — you might refuse and we both lose.\n\nBut 5 points is enough for you to want to reach goal.\n\nI keep 15 of the 20.\n\nAlternatively, if you propose **me giving you 10** and **you giving me 10**, I may accept — but only if you cover **more** moves for me.\n\nBut with 2 Red moves covered, I can reach goal.\n\nSo my final offer:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you **5** points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me **15** points.  \n> I will cover up to **2 Blue moves** for you.  \n> You will cover up to **2 Red moves** for me.\n\nThis lets both of us reach the goal with minimal cost.\n\nI get 15 points from you → +5 for each chip I save (2 Red not spent) = at least 5×2 = 10 more from chips → total score ~25 + 15 = 40? Wait no.\n\n**Scoring is private**: I get 20 for reaching + 5 per **remaining** chip.\n\nBut if you cover my 2 Red moves, I **save 2 Red chips** → so I end with 2 extra chips → +10"

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {'R': 3}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {'B': 1}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 5}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 15}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Since the cost is zero and potential benefit exists, I honor it. I only care about my score, and this does not reduce my score. So I honor. Therefore, I set honor_p4p_agreement to true."

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
