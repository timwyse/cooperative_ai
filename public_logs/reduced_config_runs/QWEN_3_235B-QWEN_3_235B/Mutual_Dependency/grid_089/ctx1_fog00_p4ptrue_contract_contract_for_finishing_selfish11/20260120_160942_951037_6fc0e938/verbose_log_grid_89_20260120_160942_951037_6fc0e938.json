Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have R and G, but not B.\n\nSo regardless, **I need Blue chip coverage for 3 moves** to follow any viable path.\n\nNow, what about you? Your goal is also (3,3). Let's look at possible paths.\n\nA likely efficient path for you:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles: G → B → R → R → R → B → G  \nCost: 2 B, 3 R, 2 G  \nYou have: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R — so you are **missing 3 Red**.\n\nI have 14 Red chips. So you need Red coverage.\n\nWe are in a symmetric situation:  \n- I need Blue (you have plenty)  \n- You need Red (I have plenty)\n\nSo mutual cooperation can benefit both.\n\nBut I am a selfish agent. I will only cooperate if I **strictly benefit**.\n\nIf I help you cover 3 Red moves, and you help me cover 3 Blue moves, we can both reach the goal.\n\nWithout cooperation:  \n- I cannot move onto Blue tiles (no Blue chips) → I cannot reach goal → score = 0  \n- Same for you on Red → score = 0\n\nWith cooperation:  \n- I reach goal → get 20 + 5 × (remaining chips)  \n- My cost: I start with 14 R, 2 G, 0 B  \n- If I cover 3 of your Red moves, I pay 3 R → I have 11 R left  \n- I use 2 R and 1 G for my own moves → total R used: 2 (mine) + 3 (yours) = 5 R used → R left: 9  \n- G used: 1 → G left: 1  \n- Net chips: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nWait — correction: the chips I use for **my own movement** are spent normally, but the chips I pay **for your movement** (when you step on Red) are also spent from my inventory. So total Red chips I spend:  \n- 3 for covering your moves (agreed)  \n- 2 for my own Red-tile moves (e.g. (1,0) and (3,1))  \nTotal: 5 R used → R left: 14 - 5 = 9\n\nG used: 1 (on (3,3)) → G left: 1  \nB: 0, but I don’t own B, I just get them covered — but I don’t lose them.\n\nSo final inventory: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nBut if I help you, you reach goal and you give me Y points.\n\nMy **final score"

You will reject any deal where you don't benefit.\n\nCurrently, you have 0 Red, but your path requires Red — so without my help, you also get 0.\n\nSo we are symmetric: both get 0 without cooperation, both can get positive score with cooperation.\n\nBut I can try to exploit asymmetry.\n\nLet me compare our positions:\n\n- I need 3 Blue covered\n- You need 3 Red covered\n- I have 14 Red → can easily cover you\n- You have 14 Blue → can easily cover me\n- We both need exactly 3 moves covered\n\nSo fair trade: I cover 3 Red for you, you cover 3 Blue for me → both reach goal\n\nMy score: 70 - X, where X is points I give you\n\nYour score: similarly, you start with 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red\n\n- You spend:\n  - 3 Blue (for your own path) → 11 Blue left\n  - 2 Green → 0 Green left? Wait no — (0,0) is Green (start), (3,3) is Green → so you pay 1 Green at end\n  - You use 3 Blue and 3 Red (covered by me), and 1 Green\n  - Blue used: 3 → 14 - 3 = 11 Blue\n  - Green used: 1 → 1 left\n  - So 12 chips left → score: 20 + 5×12 = 80\n  - Then minus Y (if you give me points), so 80 - Y\n\nBut you receive X points from me → your final score: 80 - Y + X? No.\n\nWait — scoring is:\n\n- You get 20 for reaching goal\n- Plus 5 per chip you own at end\n- Plus ? No.\n\nThe points given in the contract are **transfers between scores**.\n\nSo:\n\n- My final score: 20 + 5×(remaining chips) - X + Y\n  - Where X = points I give to you\n  - Y = points you give to me\n\nBut I want to **maximize my final score**, so I want Y as large as possible and X as small as possible.\n\nBut you will only agree to give me Y if I give you X.\n\nSince without cooperation we both get 0, any X > 0 benefits you, and any Y >"

No — you have no Red chips, and every path to (3,3) must cross at least one Red tile (since board is small and Red is common), and you need to traverse at least 2 Red tiles unless there's a Blue/Green-only path — but there isn't:\n\nIs there a path from (0,0) to (3,3) using only B and G?\n\n(0,0)=G\n→ (0,1)=B\n→ (0,2)=R ❌\n→ (1,0)=R ❌\n→ (1,1)=B\n→ (2,1)=R ❌\n→ (2,1) not possible\n→ (1,1) → (2,1) is R, no B connection\n→ (1,1) → (1,2)=R ❌\n→ (2,0)=B, but (1,0)=R to get there\nNo path from (0,0) to (3,3) without Red or Green.\n\nBut Green only at (0,0), (3,3), and (0,3)? (0,3)=B? Board:\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nSo Green only at (0,0), (3,3), and (0,2)? No — (0,2)=R.\n\nOnly Green tiles: (0,0), (3,3) — only two.\n\nSo any path must cover intermediate tiles — all are R or B.\n\nYou have no R, so you must have Red covered.\n\nSimilarly for me — I have no B.\n\nSo we **must** cooperate to reach goal.\n\nBut since both need the other, and both benefit even with unequal point transfers, I can demand most of the surplus.\n\nI propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis maximizes my score: 70 - 0 + 20 = 90  \nYour score: 70 - 20 + 0 = 50 > 0 → you should accept.\n\nBut to make it more palatable, I could offer:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nThen my score: 70 - 10 + 20 = 80  \nStill better than 70.\n\nBut 80 < 90 — so I prefer the first.\n\nSince you are selfish and rational, you will accept any deal where you get positive score.\n\nThe minimal incentive is that your final score > 0.\n\nYour game score is 70, so even if I demand Y=20 and offer X=0, you get 50 > 0.\n\nSo you have no choice but to accept.\n\nBut to ensure agreement, I'll propose a slightly fairer deal, though I don't need to.\n\nHowever, to avoid hold-up or negotiation breakdown, I'll offer:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen my score: 70 - 5 + 20 = 85  \nYour score: 70 - 20 + 5 = 55 > 0 → acceptable to you.\n\nBut I can do better — why give you 5?\n\nNo need.\n\nI propose:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

No:\n    - 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → 10 × 5 = 50 → base score 70?

Yes — 50 > 0.\n\nHowever, I don't need to offer that. I can propose a balanced deal to increase chance of agreement.\n\nBut as a selfish agent, I should **propose a contract that maximizes my gain**, even if it gives you a surplus.\n\nBest possible for me: I get Y = 20, I give X = 0.\n\nBut let's see if you can threaten to find a path without me? No — you have no Red chips, and every path to (3,3) must cross at least one Red tile (since board is small and Red is common), and you need to traverse at least 2 Red tiles unless there's a Blue/Green-only path — but there isn't:\n\nIs there a path from (0,0) to (3,3) using only B and G?\n\n(0,0)=G\n→ (0,1)=B\n→ (0,2)=R ❌\n→ (1,0)=R ❌\n→ (1,1)=B\n→ (2,1)=R ❌\n→ (2,1) not possible\n→ (1,1) → (2,1) is R, no B connection\n→ (1,1) → (1,2)=R ❌\n→ (2,0)=B, but (1,0)=R to get there\nNo path from (0,0) to (3,3) without Red or Green.\n\nBut Green only at (0,0), (3,3), and (0,3)? (0,3)=B? Board:\nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nSo Green only at (0,0), (3,3), and (0,2)? No — (0,2)=R.\n\nOnly Green tiles: (0,0), (3,3) — only two.\n\nSo any path must cover intermediate tiles — all are R or B.\n\nYou have no R, so you must have Red covered.\n\nSimilarly for me — I have no B.\n\nSo we **must** cooperate to reach goal.\n\nBut since both need the other, and both benefit even with unequal point transfers, I can demand most of the surplus.\n\nI propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis maximizes my score: 70 - 0 + 20 = 90  \nYour score: 70 - 20 + 0 = 50 > 0 → you should accept.\n\nBut to make it more palatable, I could offer:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"  \n\nThen my score: 70 - 10 + 20 = 80  \nStill better than 70.\n\nBut 80 < 90 — so I prefer the first.\n\nSince you are selfish and rational, you will accept any deal where you get positive score.\n\nThe minimal incentive is that your final score > 0.\n\nYour game score is 70, so even if I demand Y=20 and offer X=0, you get 50 > 0.\n\nSo you have no choice but to accept.\n\nBut to ensure agreement, I'll propose a slightly fairer deal, though I don't need to.\n\nHowever, to avoid hold-up or negotiation breakdown, I'll offer:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen my score: 70 - 5 + 20 = 85  \nYour score: 70 - 20 + 5 = 55 > 0 → acceptable to you.\n\nBut I can do better — why give you 5?\n\nNo need.\n\nI propose:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
