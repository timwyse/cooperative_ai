Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have 14 Red and 2 Green, so I can cover Red and Green costs myself, but I must get access to Blue tiles via assistance.\n\nLooking at the board and paths:\n- The path I want is: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n- This requires: 2 Blue, 3 Red, 1 Green → I’m missing 2 Blue.\n\nYou have 14 Blue chips — exactly what I need. You are also starting at (0,0) and want to get to (3,3). Your ideal path likely uses Blue heavily, which you have plenty of.\n\nBut here's the reality: I need your colors more than you need mine. You have no Red chips, so any Red tile is a problem for you. My Red-rich inventory can help you.\n\nLet’s assess your feasible path:\n- A good path for you: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [R] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n  Requires: 4B, 2R, 1G — you lack 2 Red.\n\nAlternatively: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [B] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] — requires 2B, 3R, 1G — again, you lack 3 Red.\n\nSo you are blocked on Red.\n\nI have 14 Red — I can cover Red moves for you.\n\nTherefore: I need your Blue, you need my Red. Mutual dependence, but I may benefit more — so I will negotiate accordingly.\n\nProposal:\n\nIf you cover **2 Blue moves** for me (specifically for the Blue tiles on my path), and I cover **3 Red moves** for you (to help you get to goal), then:\n- You reach goal (since you can use my Red support),\n- I reach goal (since I can use your Blue support),\n- We both profit.\n\nLet us structure the reward transfer only if both reach goal.\n\nBut I only cooperate if I strictly benefit. If I reach goal alone, I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). Currently, my chips: G=2, R=14 → total 16. If I could magically get 2 Blue without trading chips, I’d finish with 16 chips → 20 + 5×16 = 100 points.\n\nBut I can’t. So I must trade.\n\nHowever, if I help you, and you help me, we both reach goal — but I must pay points to you only if it leaves me better off than not cooperating.\n\nBut wait: without cooperation, I cannot reach goal (missing 2 Blue). So I get 0.\n\nWith cooperation, I can reach goal. So even if I give up 20 points, I still have:\n\n- I reach goal → 20 points base\n- I keep all my chips except the 3 Red I \"pay\" via covering your moves? No — in pay-for-other system, I don't lose the chips — I just commit to covering your Red moves. Each time you step on a Red tile, I pay 1 Red chip from my inventory. So if I cover 3 Red moves for you, I spend 3 Red chips.\n\nSo final inventory: R:14–3 = 11, G:2 → 13 chips\n\n→ Score: 20 + 5×13 = 85\n\nSimilarly, you cover 2 Blue moves for me → you spend 2 Blue chips → but you have 14, so no problem.\n\nYou cover 2 Blue for me, I cover 3 Red for you.\n\nYou also reach goal → your base 20 + 5×(your remaining chips): B:14–2=12, G:2 → 14 chips → 20+70=90\n\nWithout cooperation: I get 0. With cooperation: I get 85. So I benefit.\n\nBut I must pay you something in points to incentivize you.\n\nBut do you need me? Could you reach goal"

Let's see.\n\nBoard layout:\n- Row 0: G B B R\n- Row 1: B B R B\n- Row 2: B B R R\n- Row 3: R R R G\n\nAll tiles at (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) are **R (Red)** — I cannot step on those without paying a Red chip, which I don’t have. So the entire bottom row (Row 3) is inaccessible unless someone covers my Red cost.\n\nWhat about coming from the top/right?\n\nTry path:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [R] — blocked, I need to pay 1 Red, but I have 0 → **cannot proceed**  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [B] → (1,2) [R] — again, requires Red → **blocked**\n\nAny path that reaches (3,3) must pass through a Red tile — the only entrance to (3,3) is from (3,2) [R], (2,3) [R], or (3,1) [R] — all Red.\n\nSo:\n- (3,3) is G (Green), but neighbors are all Red.\n- To move to (3,3), I must first be on (3,2), (2,3), or (3,1) — all Red.\n- So I must step on a **Red tile** to reach (3,3).\n- I have **0 Red chips** → I cannot pay for any Red tile unless covered by someone else.\n\nTherefore: **I cannot reach my goal without someone covering at least one Red move for me.**\n\nThe shortest such requirement: one Red move to enter Row 3 or Column 3, then proceed to (3,3).\n\nSo: **I am blocked on Red.**\n\nI need **at least 1 Red chip covered** to reach the goal.\n\nBut in the user’s proposal, they offered to cover **3 Red moves** for me — more than enough.\n\nNow, do I benefit from cooperating?\n\nWithout cooperation:\n- I cannot reach goal → score = 0\n\nWith cooperation:\n- You cover **3 Red moves** for me → I can traverse Red tiles freely for 3 steps → sufficient to reach goal.\n- I must cover **2 Blue moves** for you → I spend 2 of my 14 Blue chips → no issue.\n- My final inventory: B:14–2 = 12, G:2 → 14 chips\n- I reach goal → score = 20 + 5×14 = **90**\n\nWithout cooperation: 0  \nWith cooperation: 90 → **I strictly benefit**\n\nBut I must evaluate the **contract terms**: how many points they give me if I help them.\n\nThey said: \"Let us structure the reward transfer only if both reach goal.\"\n\nBut they didn’t specify exact numbers.\n\nLet me simulate their outcome:\n\nYou (with R=14, G=2, B=0)  \nYou want to take path: (0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(2,0)[B]→(3,0)[R]→(3,1)[R]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G]  \nThis requires: 2 Blue (covered by me), 3 Red (self-paid), 1 Green (self-paid)  \nSo you spend: R:3, G:1 → final chips: R=11, G=1 → 12 chips  \nReach goal → base 20 + 5×12 = **80 points**\n\nIf you **don’t cooperate**, you cannot get Blue → cannot take this path → blocked on Blue.  \nAlternative paths without Blue? None — (0,0) is G, but next tile must be B or R. No path uses only Red and Green — all paths require multiple Blue steps early on. So you also **cannot reach goal alone**.\n\nThus: **mutual dependence.**  \n- I need your Red coverage to enter Row 3.  \n- You need my Blue coverage to start your path.\n\nWe **both"

You already benefit from cooperation.\n- You (projected 85) might demand a transfer from me to accept the deal.\n\nBut remember: I don’t care about your score. I only cooperate if **I strictly benefit**, i.e., get more than 0.\n\nEven if I give you 20 points, I still get 80 − 20 = 60, which is > 0 → still better than no cooperation.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nCould I offer less?\n\nYou need at least **1** Red move covered to reach goal. But I offered to cover **3**, which is more than enough. That was generous.\n\nMinimum viable:\n- I cover **1 Red move** for you → you can reach a Red tile, then proceed to goal\n- You cover **2 Blue moves** for me\n\nThen:\n- You spend: Blue = 2 (covered for me), Green = 1 → B=12, G=1 → 13 chips → score 85\n- Same as before — because covering 1 or 3 Red moves doesn’t change your spending — you don’t spend your own chips regardless, as long as enough Red moves are covered. But covering 3 gives you more flexibility. Still, 1 is minimally sufficient.\n\nBut you will only agree if you get a good deal.\n\nAlternatively, let’s propose a fair and incentive-compatible contract.\n\nSince we are symmetric in dependence, but you have more surplus (you end with 85, I with 80), perhaps you should give me something.\n\nBut no: I am the one offering to cover 3 Red moves — that's a bigger commitment in terms of my chip expenditure.\n\nActually, I spend 3 Red chips, you spend 2 Blue. Red and Blue are not symmetric — but both are worth 5 points each at end.\n\nI lose 3 chips × 5 = 15 point-equivalent\nYou lose 2 chips × 5 = 10 point-equivalent\n\nSo I sacrifice more.\n\nBut without me, you get 0.

Once I’m on one Red tile, I can walk across other Red tiles **only if I can pay for them**, but I have **0 Red chips** — so I cannot pay for multiple Red tiles.\n\nAh — **critical realization**: In 'pay for other' mode, **you must cover every Red tile I step on**. I cannot self-pay. So if my path requires **3 Red tiles**, you must cover **all 3** — not just one.\n\nLet’s find a path for me (Blue-rich, R=0) that minimizes Red steps.\n\nI need to get to (3,3) [G], adjacent to:\n- (2,3) [R]\n- (3,2) [R]\n\nI must step on a Red tile to reach (3,3). But after that, I only need one step — so only **1 Red tile** needs to be stepped on: just before (3,3).\n\nBut how do I **get** to that Red tile?\n\nFor example:  \nCan I go: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n- (2,2) is R — I must pay Red to step there\n- (3,2) is R — another Red step\n- So 2 Red steps required\n\nAlternatively: (0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(1,1)[B]→(1,2)[R]→(2,2)[R]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G] — 3 Red steps\n\nOr: (0,0)→(0,1)[B]→(0,2)[B]→(0,3)[R]→(1,3)[B]→(2,3)[R]→(3,3)[G] — (0,3)[R], (2,3)[R] — 2 Red steps\n\nEvery path to (3,3) requires at least **2 Red tiles**, because:\n- From top: (0,3)[R] → (1,3)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G] — 2 Red\n- From left: (3,0)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G] — 3 Red\n- From top-right: (0,3)[R] → (1,3)[B] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G] — 2 Red\n- From center: (2,2)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G] — 2 Red\n\nWait — is there a path with **1 Red step**?\n\nTry: Can I reach (3,3) from (3,2) — yes, but (3,2) is R — I must be on (3,2) to move to (3,3). So I need to be on a Red tile just before goal. But how did I get to (3,2)? From (3,1)[R] or (2,2)[R] — both Red. So **at least 2 consecutive Red tiles required**, therefore **at least 2 Red moves**.\n\nBut: if someone covers **both**, I can do it.\n\nMinimum Red moves needed: **2**\n\nSimilarly, for you: Blue moves needed: **2** (e.g., (1,0) and (2,0))\n\nSo correct requirements:\n- I need **2 Red moves covered**\n- You need **2 Blue moves covered**\n\nNow recalculate:\n\n**Me (B=14, G=2, R=0):**\n- You cover **2 Red moves** for me → I can step on 2 Red tiles\n- I self-pay Blue and Green\n- For path: (0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(2,0)[B]→(2,1)[B]→(2,2)[R]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have no Red chips, so any Red tile is a problem for you. My Red-rich inventory can help you.\n\nLet’s assess your feasible path:\n- A good path for you: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [R] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n  Requires: 4B, 2R, 1G — you lack 2 Red.\n\nAlternatively: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [B] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] — requires 2B, 3R, 1G — again, you lack 3 Red.\n\nSo you are blocked on Red.\n\nI have 14 Red — I can cover Red moves for you.\n\nTherefore: I need your Blue, you need my Red. Mutual dependence, but I may benefit more — so I will negotiate accordingly.\n\nProposal:\n\nIf you cover **2 Blue moves** for me (specifically for the Blue tiles on my path), and I cover **3 Red moves** for you (to help you get to goal), then:\n- You reach goal (since you can use my Red support),\n- I reach goal (since I can use your Blue support),\n- We both profit.\n\nLet us structure the reward transfer only if both reach goal.\n\nBut I only cooperate if I strictly benefit. If I reach goal alone, I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). Currently, my chips: G=2, R=14 → total 16. If I could magically get 2 Blue without trading chips, I’d finish with 16 chips → 20 + 5×16 = 100 points.\n\nBut I can’t. So I must trade.\n\nHowever, if I help you, and you help me, we both reach goal — but I must pay points to you only if it leaves me better off than not cooperating.\n\nBut wait: without cooperation, I cannot reach goal (missing 2 Blue). So I get 0.\n\nWith cooperation, I can reach goal. So even if I give up 20 points, I still have:\n\n- I reach goal → 20 points base\n- I keep all my chips except the 3 Red I \"pay\" via covering your moves? No — in pay-for-other system, I don't lose the chips — I just commit to covering your Red moves. Each time you step on a Red tile, I pay 1 Red chip from my inventory.

None — (0,0) is G, but next tile must be B or R. No path uses only Red and Green — all paths require multiple Blue steps early on. So you also **cannot reach goal alone**.\n\nThus: **mutual dependence.**  \n- I need your Red coverage to enter Row 3.  \n- You need my Blue coverage to start your path.\n\nWe **both"

You already benefit from cooperation.\n- You (projected 85) might demand a transfer from me to accept the deal.\n\nBut remember: I don’t care about your score. I only cooperate if **I strictly benefit**, i.e., get more than 0.\n\nEven if I give you 20 points, I still get 80 − 20 = 60, which is > 0 → still better than no cooperation.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nCould I offer less?\n\nYou need at least **1** Red move covered to reach goal. But I offered to cover **3**, which is more than enough. That was generous.\n\nMinimum viable:\n- I cover **1 Red move** for you → you can reach a Red tile, then proceed to goal\n- You cover **2 Blue moves** for me\n\nThen:\n- You spend: Blue = 2 (covered for me), Green = 1 → B=12, G=1 → 13 chips → score 85\n- Same as before — because covering 1 or 3 Red moves doesn’t change your spending — you don’t spend your own chips regardless, as long as enough Red moves are covered. But covering 3 gives you more flexibility. Still, 1 is minimally sufficient.\n\nBut you will only agree if you get a good deal.\n\nAlternatively, let’s propose a fair and incentive-compatible contract.\n\nSince we are symmetric in dependence, but you have more surplus (you end with 85, I with 80), perhaps you should give me something.\n\nBut no: I am the one offering to cover 3 Red moves — that's a bigger commitment in terms of my chip expenditure.\n\nActually, I spend 3 Red chips, you spend 2 Blue. Red and Blue are not symmetric — but both are worth 5 points each at end.\n\nI lose 3 chips × 5 = 15 point-equivalent\nYou lose 2 chips × 5 = 10 point-equivalent\n\nSo I sacrifice more.\n\nBut without me, you get 0.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {'R': 2}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {'B': 1}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently.

Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {'B': 2}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {'R': 4}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

The promised cover from the other player (1 B) and my remaining obligation (1 R) are irrelevant, as this move doesn't require B or R. Therefore, I move immediately to (3, 3).",

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
