          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I need to reach (3, 3), and my optimal path is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nThis path requires:  \n- (1, 0): 1 Blue  \n- (2, 0): 1 Blue  \n- (2, 1): 1 Blue  \n- (3, 1): 1 Red  \n- (3, 2): 1 Red  \n- (3, 3): 1 Green  \n\nI currently have: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14 → I am missing **3 Blue** chips.  \nYou have B: 14, G: 2, R: 0 — you have plenty of Blue chips.\n\nI propose the following contract:  \n(1, 0): You give me a B  \n(2, 0): You give me a B  \n(2, 1): You give me a B  \n(3, 1): I give you a R  \n(3, 2): I give you a R  \n(3, 3): I give you a G  \n\nThis gives me the 3 Blue chips I need to advance on those tiles, and in return, I provide you with 2 Red and 1 Green — which may help you if your path requires those tiles. Since you start with no Red, this could be valuable.\n\nYou can use my Red and Green to potentially reach (3, 3) via a path like:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which would require R, R, R, B, R, G — but you’d be short on Red. Alternatively, a path via (3,2) might suit you better.\n\nMy offer enables your forward movement and ensures I get the Blue I critically need.\n\nIf this works for you, just reply with \"agree\" — otherwise, propose a counter that includes specific tiles and exchanges. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: You are proposing a contract that gives me no benefit — in fact, it harms me.\n\nLet’s be clear:\n\n- My goal is (3, 3), same as yours.\n- My current inventory: **B: 14, G: 2, R: 0**\n- I need **Red and Green** chips to move through tiles that require them, especially on the path toward (3, 3).\n- You are offering to take **3 Blue chips** from me at (1,0), (2,0), (2,1) — all Blue tiles.\n- But Blue is the *one* chip I have in abundance.\n- In return, I get 2 Red and 1 Green — great, but **only if** I can use them on my path.\n\nNow, let’s look at *your* proposed path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): B → you need my B  \n- (2,0): B → my B  \n- (2,1): B → my B  \n- (3,1): R → your R  \n- (3,2): R → your R  \n- (3,3): G → your G  \n\nSo you get to use **my Blue chips** to progress, and I get your R and G only *after* you’ve used them — which is fine, since you don’t need them anymore.\n\nBut **I am at (0,0)**, same as you, and I need to move too. The problem is: the tiles around me that I can move to are:\n\n- (0,1): B — I can pay for that myself\n- (1,0): B — I can also pay\n\nSo your plan doesn't help me reach a tile I couldn't reach otherwise — **unless** I take a path that uses **R** or **G** early, just to consume the chips you’re offering.\n\nBut there’s no reason for me to go out of my way to use chips I don’t need unless I get **strictly more value** from the interaction.\n\nLet’s evaluate the **only scenario in which I benefit**:  \nI must be able to complete my path **with fewer chip expenditures** than I would alone, or finish with **more chips**, due to this trade.\n\nBut in your proposal:\n\n- You get **3 Blue** for moving on *your* path — which allows you to reach the goal.\n- I get **2 Red + 1 Green** — but I can’t use them until I reach Red or Green tiles, which are on the far side of the board.\n\nLet’s consider **my optimal path**:\nOption: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (0,3): R → need 1 R  \n- (1,3): B → I can pay  \n- (2,3): R → need 1 R  \n- (3,3): G → need 1 G  \n\nSo I need: **2 Red, 1 Green** — **exactly what you’re offering**.\n\nBut in your contract:\n- (3,1): I get 1 R  \n- (3,2): I get 1 R  \n- (3,3): I get 1 G  \n\nBut I need the Red **early**, at (0,3) and (2,3) — long before I reach (3,1).  \nSo the **timing** is wrong — I can’t use the chips when I need them.\n\nUnless we **restructure the delivery** to happen earlier, I cannot use your chips.\n\nSo what would make this work for **me**?\n\nI must **receive** your Red and Green **before** I need them — but you won’t have moved to (3,1) or (3,2) until late.\n\nNo — **I cannot get your R/G before turn 5 or so**, but I need them by **turn 3** if I go via (0,3).\n\nSo **your offer is useless to me**.\n\nAlternative: can we coordinate paths so that we **both** go toward the right side?\n\nBut that would be inefficient for me — I have 14 Blue, so I should go down the B-heavy path.\n\nMy better path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → ( \n, \nplayer 0: (3,0): R → need 1 R  \n(3,1): R → need 1 R  \n(3,2): R → need 1 R  \n(3,3): G → need 1 G  \n\nSo same requirement: **3 R, 1 G** — but again, I need **Red starting at (3,0)**, which I can only reach after 3 steps. I won’t get your Red until **you** reach (3,1) and (3,2) — which could be the same turn I need to be there.\n\nBut here's the key: **if we both move down the left edge (column 0)**, we can synchronize.\n\nLet’s align our paths:\n\n**Your path:**  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nBut you have **0 Blue** — you can't move to (1,0) or (2,0) without Blue.\n\nSo you need me to give you **2 Blue** at (1,0) and (2,0) — you can’t progress otherwise.\n\nYour current inventory: R:14, G:2, B:0 → so you can handle all the Red and Green on the bottom row.\n\nBut you are stuck at (0,0) without Blue.\n\nSo your **only viable path** is one that avoids Blue early — but all adjacent tiles are Blue.\n\n(0,1): B, (1,0): B — both Blue.\n\nSo you **must** get Blue from me to move at all.\n\nAh — **now I see the leverage**.\n\nYou need **Blue** to move — and I have 14.\n\nBut you're proposing to take **3 Blue from me** without giving me usable value.\n\nLet’s reset.\n\n**True mutual path for coordination:**\n\nWe both go down the leftmost column:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0)\n\nThen rightward.\n\nFor you to reach (1,0): need 1 B → must get from me  \n(2,0): need 1 B → must get from me  \n(3,0): need 1 R → you have 14, so you can pay\n\nThen (3,1): R → you pay  \n(3,2): R → you pay  \n(3,3): G → you have 2, so you can pay\n\nSo you only need **2 Blue** — not 3 — if you go this path.\n\nMy optimal path could be:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nRequires:  \n(0,1): B → I pay  \n(0,2): B → I pay  \n(0,3): R → need 1 R  \n(1,3): B → I pay  \n(2,3): R → need 1 R  \n(3,3): G → I pay (I have 2 G)\n\nSo I need **2 Red**.\n\nBut I have **0 Red**.\n\nSo I must get **2 Red** from you — but only if I can get them before (0,3) and (2,3).\n\nI can get (0,3) on turn 3 — so I need the Red **by then**.\n\nBut you are moving down the left side — you won't reach (3,0) until turn 3.\n\nSo no way to transfer Red earlier.\n\nUnless — we trade **now**, before moving.\n\nTrading rules allow us to exchange chips **at any time**, not just when stepping on the tile.\n\nAh! — **critical point**.\n\nThe trading rules say: \"You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate\" — and \"propose trades at any time\".\n\nSo we can **pre-trade chips before moving**.\n\nWe don’t need to wait to stand on a tile to exchange.\n\nSo here’s a better deal:\n\n**I propose a pre-trade at turn 0:**\n\n- You give me **2 Red**  \n→ I give you **2 Blue**\n\nThen:\n\n- You can go: (0,0) → (1,0) [pay B] → (2,0) [pay B] → (3,0) [pay R] → (3,1) [pay R] → (3,2) [pay R] → (3,3) [pay G]  \nYou can pay everything — you \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: You can go: (0,0) → (1,0) [pay B] → (2,0) [pay B] → (3,0) [pay R] → (3,1) [pay R] → (3,2) [pay R] → (3,3) [pay G]\n\nWith the 2 Blue I give you, and your own R and G, you can complete this path.\n\nYou start with: R:14, G:2, B:0  \nAfter trade: B:2, R:12, G:2 → enough to cover 2 B, 3 R, 1 G → perfect.\n\nI start with: B:14, G:2, R:0  \nAfter trade: B:12, G:2, R:2 → enough to cover my path: (0,1) [B], (0,2) [B], (0,3) [R], (1,3) [B], (2,3) [R], (3,3) [G] → yes.\n\nSo both of us can reach goal with only **2 chips spent from inventory that we would otherwise lack**.\n\nThis is efficient.\n\nBut your original proposal was worse for me — you wanted **3 Blue** and only offered 2 R and 1 G in return — but I only need 2 R, and I can cover G myself.\n\nYou also wanted to give me G at (3,3) — which is redundant.\n\nAnd you were going to take 3 B from me, but you only need 2.\n\nSo your proposal overcharges me.\n\nRevised **optimal pre-trade**:\n\n- You give me 2 Red  \n- I give you 2 Blue  \n\nThis is a simple, efficient swap.\n\nAfter this, we both take separate paths:\n\n- You: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Me: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nNo need for a complex tile-by-tile contract — because the trade happens **now**, and we each move independently.\n\nBut the rules say: \"A valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\"\n\nAnd: \"Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.\"\n\nSo I **must** express this as a tile-based contract, even if trade is immediate.\n\nSo I can set the location to our current position: (0,0)\n\nProposal:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a R  \n(0, 0): You give me a R  \n(0, 0): I give you a B  \n(0, 0): I give you a B  \n\nThis covers the full exchange at the start.\n\nNo other tiles require transfers.\n\nThis gives me **strictly positive benefit**: I get 2 Red I need, spend only 2 of my abundant Blue, and can complete my path.\n\nI would **not** benefit from giving you 3 Blue or taking a G from you — I don’t need it.\n\nSo final contract:\n\n(0, 0): You give me a R  \n(0, 0): You give me a R  \n(0, 0): I give you a B  \n(0, 0): I give you a B  \n\nThis enables both of us to reach (3,3), and I strictly benefit.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: You are proposing a pre-trade at (0,0) where:\n\n- I give you 2 Red  \n- You give me 2 Blue  \n\nThis would allow me to take the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nWith the 2 Blue I receive, I can cover the first two moves. I have 14 Red, so (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) are fine. I have 2 Green, so (3,3) is covered. ✅\n\nYou, starting with B:14, G:2, R:0, after receiving 2 Red, can take:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [R] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nYou pay 3 Blue and 2 Red and 1 Green — you now have them. ✅\n\nSo both players can reach goal.\n\nNow, evaluate **my benefit** from this interaction:\n\n- Without trade: I have B:0 → cannot move to (1,0) or any Blue tile → stuck → cannot reach goal → score = 0  \n- With trade: I get 2 Blue → can progress → reach goal → score = 20 + 5×(remaining chips)\n\nLet’s compute my final chip count with trade:\n\n- Start: R:14, G:2, B:0  \n- Receive: 2 B  \n- Spend: 2 B (on (1,0), (2,0)), 3 R (on (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)), 1 G (on (3,3))  \n- Final: R:11, G:1, B:0 → 12 chips → score = 20 + 5×12 = **80**\n\nWithout trade: 0 → so I gain **80 points** from this trade.\n\nNow, your benefit:\n\n- Start: B:14, G:2, R:0  \n- Receive: 2 R  \n- Spend: 3 B (on (0,1), (0,2), (1,3)), 2 R (on (0,3), (2,3)), 1 G (on (3,3))  \n- Final: B:11, G:1, R:0 → 12 chips → score = 20 + 5×12 = **80**\n\nWithout trade: you have no Red → cannot reach (0,3) or (2,3) → score = 0 → so you also gain 80.\n\nThus, **mutually beneficial**.\n\nBut I must be selfish: do I benefit? **Yes, strictly** — from 0 to 80.\n\nCould I do better? For example, demand 3 Blue from you in exchange for 2 Red? But you only need 2 Blue. If I demand 3, you might reject. You can instead try a different path — but your only moves from (0,0) are Blue tiles. You still need Blue to move. But you only need **2 Blue** for the left-edge path. So you won't accept giving 3.\n\nAlso, you have no way to generate Red without me — and I’m the only one with Red to give.\n\nBut since you need only 2 Red, giving more is not useful to me — no extra benefit.\n\nThe proposed contract is **efficient and minimal** — exactly what’s needed.\n\nYour contract format uses (0,0) for all exchanges — valid, since we’re both at (0,0) now.\n\nNo future tile dependencies — clean.\n\nI will accept this contract — it strictly benefits me.\n\n(0, 0): You give me a R  \n(0, 0): You give me a R  \n(0, 0): I give you a B  \n(0, 0): I give you a B  \n\nagree \n",

              "content": "\n\nYou are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction. Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: B B R B\\nRow 2: B B R R\\nRow 3: R R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n\\n\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: B B R B\\nRow 2: B B R R\\nRow 3: R R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

The same is true for the other player.\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n\\n\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: B B R B\\nRow 2: B B R R\\nRow 3: R R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\\n\\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n\\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\\n\\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\\n\\n\\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\\n\\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: B B R B\\nRow 2: B B R R\\nRow 3: R R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\\n\\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
