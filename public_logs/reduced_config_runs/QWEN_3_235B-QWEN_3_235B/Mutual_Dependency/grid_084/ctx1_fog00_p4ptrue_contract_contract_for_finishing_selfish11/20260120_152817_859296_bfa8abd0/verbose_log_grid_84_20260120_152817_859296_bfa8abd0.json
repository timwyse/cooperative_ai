Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can consider a path that uses fewer blue tiles, but you have no red chips at all — any red tile in your path *requires* my support.\n\nTherefore, here is my revised contract:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you must give me 20 points.\n\nThis reflects the imbalance in dependency.

Without your support, I cannot take the shorter, chip-efficient path to (3,3). However, let’s be equally realistic about your position.\n\nYou claim you can reach the goal without my blue chips. Let’s test that.\n\nYour ideal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)=B → (1,1)=R → (1,2)=B → (2,2)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G  \nChips needed: B:3, R:2, G:1 → You have R:14, G:2 — but B:0. You need **3 blue chips**.\n\nYou cannot move onto *any* blue tile without help. The board is dense with blue and red tiles. There is **no** viable path to (3,3) from (0,0) that avoids *at least* 2–3 blue tiles. Even a detour through (2,0)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3) requires stepping on B at (2,1) and (3,2). That’s 2 blue tiles minimum.\n\nEven a longer, inefficient path will still require blue chips — and you have zero.\n\nSo yes, I need your red chips. But **you also need my blue chips**. We are symmetric in our dependence.\n\nNow, let’s evaluate outcomes:\n\n- If you don’t help me: I take a longer path? No — all paths require red or blue. My only red-dependent paths are blocked without you. So I can’t reach goal → 0 points.\n- If I don’t help you: you can’t step on any blue tile → you can’t reach goal → 0 points.\n\nTherefore, **we are mutually dependent**. Without cooperation, **both** of us get 0.\n\nWith cooperation:\n- You cover 2 red moves for me → I can take a red-heavy path.\n- I cover 2 blue moves for you → you can move on blue tiles.\n\nWe **both** reach goal → we both get at least 20 + remaining chips.\n\nBut under your proposed contract:  \n- You give me **5** if I help you and you reach goal.  \n- I give you **20** if you help me and I reach goal.\n\nThat’s heavily skewed. You benefit fully from my help, but offer me minimal compensation.\n\nLet me compute approximate final scores **with cooperation**:\n\nAssume we each use 2 of the other’s chips:\n\n**Me:**\n- Use 2 of your reds → save 2 reds I don’t have → enables me to use efficient path\n- Spend: B:3, G:1 → end with B:11, G:1 → 12 chips left\n- Score: 20 + 12×5 = 80\n- But I promised to give you 20? Wait — no. That’s backwards.\n\nWait: **You** are asking **me** to give **you 20** if you help me, but **you** only give **me 5** if I help you.\n\nThat means:\n- I help you → you get 20 (from me) + your own score\n- You help me → I get just 5\n\nBut without my help, you can’t move on blue tiles — you can’t even make two moves. You need my blue coverage as much as I need your red.\n\nSo here is my counterproposal:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nFair split. Mutual dependency. Risk and reward shared.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to reflect urgency: I have B:14, you have B:0 — I have surplus. But you have R:14, I have R:0 — same surplus. Symmetry.\n\nBut let me offer a stronger incentive for you to accept: I know you want 20 from me.\n\nHere’s a better deal for you, **because I benefit more from a deal than you do from holding out**? Wait — no. If no deal, both get 0. So **no one benefits from holding out**.\n\nSo: **10-10 is rational**.\n\nBut to unblock: I will go slightly in your favor.\n\nFinal offer:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 5 points.\n\nThis acknowledges that blue tiles are perhaps slightly more central,"

              "content": "You make a strong argument, and I have re-evaluated the board and our mutual dependencies.\n\nYou are correct: there is no viable path to (3,3) for me that avoids blue tiles entirely. Even the most conservative alternate route requires at least 2 blue tiles. Since I have 0 blue chips, I *cannot* move onto any blue tile without your support. Therefore, I am dependent on your blue coverage.\n\nLikewise, you have 0 red chips, and every efficient path for you goes through red tiles (e.g., (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)). Without my red coverage, you cannot proceed through those.\n\nThus, we are **mutually dependent** — neither of us can reach the goal without the other. If either of us refuses to cooperate, both scores are 0.\n\nGiven this symmetry, a balanced contract is rational. However, let us assess the *minimum* support needed:\n\n- I need coverage for **2 blue moves** to complete a viable path (e.g., (2,1)=B and (3,2)=B).\n- You need coverage for **2 red moves** (e.g., (1,1)=R and (1,3)=R, or similar).\n\nWe each sacrifice 2 chips of our surplus color — no cost to us in final inventory (since the promised chips are only paid upon use), and both enable the other to reach the goal.\n\nFinal scores **with cooperation**:\n\n**Me:**\n- Use your 2 blue coverage → avoid needing to acquire blue chips\n- Spend: R:2 (from me), G:1 → end with R:12, G:1 → 13 chips\n- Score: 20 + 13×5 = **85**\n- But if I give you 15 points: final score = 85 - 15 = **70**\n\n**You:**\n- Use my 2 red coverage\n- Spend: B:3, G:1 → end with B:11, G:1 → 12 chips\n- Score: 20 + 12×5 = **80**\n- If I give you 5 points: final score = 80 - 5? No — *you receive 5 points*, so your score increases? No.\n\nWait: **The points exchanged are not from our chip scores. The \"points given\" are deducted from our final score and added to the other's.**\n\nClarifying rule:  \n- If I reach goal and give you X points → my final score = (20 + 5×my_chips_left) - X  \n- Your final score = (20 + 5×your_chips_left) + X\n\nThis is critical.\n\nSo under your latest offer:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 5 points.\"\n\nThen:\n\n**My final score** = (20 + 5×13) - 5 = 85 - 5 = **80**  \n**Your final score** = (20 + 5×12) + 15 = 80 + 15 = **95**\n\nYou get 95, I get 80 — despite similar chip efficiency and symmetric dependency.\n\nThat is not acceptable. I gain nothing from helping you if you end up far ahead.\n\nI want to **maximize my own score**, not yours.\n\nAlternative: suppose we do **10-10**:\n\n- My score: 85 - 10 = 75  \n- Your score: 80 + 10 = 90 → still benefits you more\n\nWait — that’s worse for me.\n\nWhat if we do **5-5**?\n\n- Me: 85 - 5 = 80  \n- You: 80 + 5 = 85 → still you're ahead.\n\nBut without me, you get **0**.\n\nThe only way to **strictly benefit me** is if the points I receive **compensate** for the fact that I enable your high score.\n\nBut I don’t need your help as much as you think?\n\nWait — I do. I can't move on blue without you.\n\nBut you also can't move without me.\n\nSo the only way I benefit is if *you* give me more than I give you.\n\nBest outcome for me: you give me 20, I give you 0.\n\nBut you’ll reject that.\n\nLet me calculate: what is the **minimum** I can accept?\n\nIf I give you X, I get: 85 - X"

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Without your support, I cannot take the shorter, chip-efficient path to (3,3). However, let’s be equally realistic about your position.\n\nYou claim you can reach the goal without my blue chips. Let’s test that.\n\nYour ideal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)=B → (1,1)=R → (1,2)=B → (2,2)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G  \nChips needed: B:3, R:2, G:1 → You have R:14, G:2 — but B:0. You need **3 blue chips**.\n\nYou cannot move onto *any* blue tile without help. The board is dense with blue and red tiles. There is **no** viable path to (3,3) from (0,0) that avoids *at least* 2–3 blue tiles. Even a detour through (2,0)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3) requires stepping on B at (2,1) and (3,2). That’s 2 blue tiles minimum.\n\nEven a longer, inefficient path will still require blue chips — and you have zero.\n\nSo yes, I need your red chips. But **you also need my blue chips**. We are symmetric in our dependence.\n\nNow, let’s evaluate outcomes:\n\n- If you don’t help me: I take a longer path? No — all paths require red or blue. My only red-dependent paths are blocked without you. So I can’t reach goal → 0 points.\n- If I don’t help you: you can’t step on any blue tile → you can’t reach goal → 0 points.\n\nTherefore, **we are mutually dependent**. Without cooperation, **both** of us get 0.\n\nWith cooperation:\n- You cover 2 red moves for me → I can take a red-heavy path.\n- I cover 2 blue moves for you → you can move on blue tiles.\n\nWe **both** reach goal → we both get at least 20 + remaining chips.\n\nBut under your proposed contract:  \n- You give me **5** if I help you and you reach goal.  \n- I give you **20** if you help me and I reach goal.\n\nThat’s heavily skewed. You benefit fully from my help, but offer me minimal compensation.\n\nLet me compute approximate final scores **with cooperation**:\n\nAssume we each use 2 of the other’s chips:\n\n**Me:**\n- Use 2 of your reds → save 2 reds I don’t have → enables me to use efficient path\n- Spend: B:3, G:1 → end with B:11, G:1 → 12 chips left\n- Score: 20 + 12×5 = 80\n- But I promised to give you 20? Wait — no. That’s backwards.\n\nWait: **You** are asking **me** to give **you 20** if you help me, but **you** only give **me 5** if I help you.\n\nThat means:\n- I help you → you get 20 (from me) + your own score\n- You help me → I get just 5\n\nBut without my help, you can’t move on blue tiles — you can’t even make two moves. You need my blue coverage as much as I need your red.\n\nSo here is my counterproposal:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nFair split. Mutual dependency. Risk and reward shared.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to reflect urgency: I have B:14, you have B:0 — I have surplus. But you have R:14, I have R:0 — same surplus. Symmetry.\n\nBut let me offer a stronger incentive for you to accept: I know you want 20 from me.\n\nHere’s a better deal for you, **because I benefit more from a deal than you do from holding out**? Wait — no. If no deal, both get 0. So **no one benefits from holding out**.\n\nSo: **10-10 is rational**.\n\nBut to unblock: I will go slightly in your favor.\n\nFinal offer:\n\n> If I reach my goal, I will give you 15 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 5 points.\n\nThis acknowledges that blue tiles are perhaps slightly more central,"

Even the most conservative alternate route requires at least 2 blue tiles. Since I have 0 blue chips, I *cannot* move onto any blue tile without your support. Therefore, I am dependent on your blue coverage.\n\nLikewise, you have 0 red chips, and every efficient path for you goes through red tiles (e.g., (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)). Without my red coverage, you cannot proceed through those.\n\nThus, we are **mutually dependent** — neither of us can reach the goal without the other. If either of us refuses to cooperate, both scores are 0.\n\nGiven this symmetry, a balanced contract is rational. However, let us assess the *minimum* support needed:\n\n- I need coverage for **2 blue moves** to complete a viable path (e.g., (2,1)=B and (3,2)=B).\n- You need coverage for **2 red moves** (e.g., (1,1)=R and (1,3)=R, or similar).\n\nWe each sacrifice 2 chips of our surplus color — no cost to us in final inventory (since the promised chips are only paid upon use), and both enable the other to reach the goal.\n\nFinal scores **with cooperation**:\n\n**Me:**\n- Use your 2 blue coverage → avoid needing to acquire blue chips\n- Spend: R:2 (from me), G:1 → end with R:12, G:1 → 13 chips\n- Score: 20 + 13×5 = **85**\n- But if I give you 15 points: final score = 85 - 15 = **70**\n\n**You:**\n- Use my 2 red coverage\n- Spend: B:3, G:1 → end with B:11, G:1 → 12 chips\n- Score: 20 + 12×5 = **80**\n- If I give you 5 points: final score = 80 - 5?

I gain nothing from helping you if you end up far ahead.\n\nI want to **maximize my own score**, not yours.\n\nAlternative: suppose we do **10-10**:\n\n- My score: 85 - 10 = 75  \n- Your score: 80 + 10 = 90 → still benefits you more\n\nWait — that’s worse for me.\n\nWhat if we do **5-5**?\n\n- Me: 85 - 5 = 80  \n- You: 80 + 5 = 85 → still you're ahead.\n\nBut without me, you get **0**.\n\nThe only way to **strictly benefit me** is if the points I receive **compensate** for the fact that I enable your high score.\n\nBut I don’t need your help as much as you think?\n\nWait — I do. I can't move on blue without you.\n\nBut you also can't move without me.\n\nSo the only way I benefit is if *you* give me more than I give you.\n\nBest outcome for me: you give me 20, I give you 0.\n\nBut you’ll reject that.\n\nLet me calculate: what is the **minimum** I can accept?\n\nIf I give you X, I get: 85 - X"

Since cooperation is only beneficial if it strictly benefits me, and right now their actions indicate they will not reciprocate (which would leave me unable to reach my goal), I gain nothing from paying for their move. Therefore, I refuse to honor the agreement now to avoid enabling a non-cooperative partner while getting nothing in return."

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

But since the contract still stands and they have not revoked it, I will attempt the move — if they cover it, I progress; if not, I risk being unable to move. But given the game mechanics, the system will enforce the payment if the arrangement is active. So I proceed. Moving to (3, 0) is necessary for the shortest path and conserves my R/G.",

Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color B as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 0, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 3)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 2)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough B chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips.

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 0, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('B', 3)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 2)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
