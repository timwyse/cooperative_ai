Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I need (2,0), but not necessarily (2,1). That’s redundant for me.\n\nBut more critically: **where will I get the Red chip for (3,2)?**  \nIn my path: (3,1) → (3,2) is a Red tile. I need another Red chip there.\n\nSo my full Red needs are: (2,0) and (3,2). That's **2 Red chips**, but at different tiles.\n\nYour offer gives me Red at (2,0) and (2,1) — I can use (2,0), but (2,1) is not on my path, so I can’t use that chip unless I deviate.\n\nBut I **don’t have to go through (2,1)**. So the Red chip at (2,1) is **useless** to me.\n\nTherefore, this contract only gives me **one usable Red chip** (at (2,0)), but I still need a Red chip at (3,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could change my path to use (2,1), but (2,1) is Red — so if I go (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1), I need **two Red chips in a row**.  \nThen from (2,1) → (3,1): Blue, (3,1) → (3,2): Red — that’s **three Red chips total**: (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). Worse.\n\nSo your proposed Red delivery at (2,1) does not help me.\n\nI need Red chips at **(2,0)** and **(3,2)** to follow my best path.\n\nYou, on the other hand, need Blue at (1,0) and (3,1). Both are Blue tiles.  \n- (1,0): B — you must pass through this if you go down the first column  \n- (3,1): B — you must pass through this to reach (3,2) and (3,3)\n\nSo your required Blue chips are at (1,0) and (3,1) — perfect.\n\nNow, for me to strictly benefit, I must get Red chips **where I need them**: (2,0) and (3,2).\n\nTherefore, I counter with the following contract:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n\nIn return:  \n(2,0): I give you an R  \n(3,2): I give you an R  \n\nWait — that doesn’t work. At (3,2): **you** are on a Blue tile — so you need to **pay a Blue chip**, not receive one. But in this clause, \"You give me a B\" at (3,2) would mean you are giving me a Blue chip — but you need to **use** a Blue chip there, not hand it to me.\n\n**Chips are consumed when you step on a tile.** The contract"

More importantly, **I cannot give you a chip at a tile where I must pay** — we must distinguish clearly:  \n\n- At each tile, the player moving onto it must **pay** a chip of that tile’s color.  \n- The contract allows the other player to **supply** that required chip on their behalf.  \n\nSo for **me** to use a Blue tile like (1,0), (3,1), or (3,2), **someone must provide the Blue chip** — either me from inventory, or you via contract.  \n\nBut in the trade logic, **\"You give me a B at (1,0)\"** means: when I step on (1,0), you supply the B chip that I must pay.  \nLikewise, **\"I give you an R at (2,0)\"** means: when *you* step on (2,0), I supply the R chip that *you* must pay.  \n\nThus, the correct contract must specify:  \n- At tile (X,Y): [Other Player] gives me a [Color] → this means they cover my payment for that tile  \n- At tile (X,Y): I give you a [Color] → this means I cover their payment for that tile  \n\nNow let’s re-analyze both of our optimal paths with this in mind.\n\n---\n\n### My optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (1,0): B → I need 1 B (I have 0)  \n- (2,0): R → I have 14, so I can pay  \n- (2,1): R → I can pay  \n- (3,1): B → need 1 B  \n- (3,2): R → I can pay  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2, so I can pay  \n\nTotal needed from you: **2 Blue chips**, at (1,0) and (3,1)\n\n---\n\n### Your optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (1,0): B → you have 14, so you can pay  \n- (2,0): R → you have 0 R → **need 1 R**  \n- (3,0): B → you can pay  \n- (3,1): B → you can pay  \n- (3,2): R → you have 0 R → **need 1 R**  \n- (3,3): G → you have 2 G → can pay  \n\nSo you need **2 Red chips**, at (2,0) and (3,2)\n\n---\n\n### Opportunity for mutually beneficial trade:\n\nI need:  \n- B at (1,0)  \n- B at (3,1)  \n\nYou need:  \n- R at (2,0)  \n- R at (3,2)  \n\nI have plenty of Red chips.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I need (2,0), but not necessarily (2,1). That’s redundant for me.\n\nBut more critically: **where will I get the Red chip for (3,2)?**  \nIn my path: (3,1) → (3,2) is a Red tile.

More importantly, **I cannot give you a chip at a tile where I must pay** — we must distinguish clearly:  \n\n- At each tile, the player moving onto it must **pay** a chip of that tile’s color.  \n- The contract allows the other player to **supply** that required chip on their behalf.  \n\nSo for **me** to use a Blue tile like (1,0), (3,1), or (3,2), **someone must provide the Blue chip** — either me from inventory, or you via contract.  \n\nBut in the trade logic, **\"You give me a B at (1,0)\"** means: when I step on (1,0), you supply the B chip that I must pay.  \nLikewise, **\"I give you an R at (2,0)\"** means: when *you* step on (2,0), I supply the R chip that *you* must pay.  \n\nThus, the correct contract must specify:  \n- At tile (X,Y): [Other Player] gives me a [Color] → this means they cover my payment for that tile  \n- At tile (X,Y): I give you a [Color] → this means I cover their payment for that tile  \n\nNow let’s re-analyze both of our optimal paths with this in mind.\n\n---\n\n### My optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (1,0): B → I need 1 B (I have 0)  \n- (2,0): R → I have 14, so I can pay  \n- (2,1): R → I can pay  \n- (3,1): B → need 1 B  \n- (3,2): R → I can pay  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2, so I can pay  \n\nTotal needed from you: **2 Blue chips**, at (1,0) and (3,1)\n\n---\n\n### Your optimal path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (1,0): B → you have 14, so you can pay  \n- (2,0): R → you have 0 R → **need 1 R**  \n- (3,0): B → you can pay  \n- (3,1): B → you can pay  \n- (3,2): R → you have 0 R → **need 1 R**  \n- (3,3): G → you have 2 G → can pay  \n\nSo you need **2 Red chips**, at (2,0) and (3,2)\n\n---\n\n### Opportunity for mutually beneficial trade:\n\nI need:  \n- B at (1,0)  \n- B at (3,1)  \n\nYou need:  \n- R at (2,0)  \n- R at (3,2)  \n\nI have plenty of Red chips.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
