Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have plenty of blue chips (14 B), which I need to reach my goal via a shorter path, and I have many red chips (14 R), which you likely need. Our goals are the same: (3,3). \n\nLooking at the paths:\n- My ideal path requires 2 Blue, 3 Red, and 1 Green. But I have **0 Blue** — I'm missing 2 Blue.\n- Your ideal path likely depends on Blue and Green, but you have **0 Red** — which means you cannot take any path requiring Red tiles unless someone covers for you.\n\nLet’s compare tile colours along potential paths to (3,3):\n\nMy current shortest viable path without trade:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nColours: G → B → R → R → B → R → G  \nThis requires 2B, 3R, 2G — but I only have 2G and 14R, so I’m short 2B.\n\nA more efficient path (shorter or cheaper) doesn't exist — length is 6 steps minimum. But if I could use Blue tiles where you cover my Blue costs, I save my own chips.\n\nNow, your situation:  \nYou start at (0,0). A viable path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nColours: R → B → B → R → B → R → G  \nThat requires 3R, 3B, 1G — you have 14B, 2G, but **0R** — so you cannot pay for any Red tile without help.\n\nTherefore:  \n- I need 2 Blue chip payments covered to complete my path efficiently.  \n- You need several Red chip payments covered (at least 2–3) to complete yours.\n\nI can cover Red moves for you. You can cover Blue moves for me.\n\nBut here's the asymmetry:  \n- There may be Blue-heavy paths for me that you can support easily (you have 14B).  \n- But Red-heavy paths for you cannot be supported by me alone if you step on many Red tiles — though your minimal path likely only needs 2–3 R.\n\nHowever, **if I help you, I still get nothing unless *I* reach my goal**. So I only help if I'm sure I will reach mine.\n\nHere’s my proposal:\n\n- I will cover up to **3 Red** moves for you (i.e., pay for your movement onto Red tiles) — this allows you to reach (3,3) via a path using up to 3 Red tiles.  \n- In return, you must cover up to **2 Blue** moves for me.\n\nWhy is this fair?  \n- I need 2 Blue — you easily spare them.  \n- You likely need 2–3 Red — I spare them, but give you exactly what you need.\n\nIn contract terms:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **18 points**.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n\nThis incentivises you to help me: you get 18 only if I succeed, which requires you to cover my 2 Blue moves.  \nI will help you (cover 3 Red), but I expect full reward if you succeed.\n\nThis maximises my gain: I keep 2 points (out of 20), but gain full benefit of your Blue coverage, which I need.\n\n**agree**"

You have 14 Red, so covering 3 for me costs you almost nothing.\n\nHowever, your proposal gives you 20 points if I reach my goal, but only gives me 18 if you reach yours. That means you are trying to extract maximum value from me while offering less in return.\n\nLet’s be clear:  \n- Without my help (covering 2 Blue for you), you **cannot reach your goal** — you have 0 Blue, and your path requires at least 2 Blue.  \n- Without your help (covering 3 Red for me), I also **cannot reach my goal** — I have 0 Red.  \n\nThis means we are symmetric in dependency: **mutual survival**.

And I gain more by ensuring full reward for enabling your success.\n\nThis is the only deal I will accept that strictly benefits me — and it does: **from 0 to full score**.\n\nAny lower than 20 from you, and I would be donating value to you without full compensation — which violates my rational self-interest.\n\nTherefore:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\n**agree**"

Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 0), chips: {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nThe other player proposed arrangement to you:\n- The other player offered to cover: [('R', 2)]\n- The other player requested to cover: [('B', 2)]\nYou REJECTED the arrangement\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (1, 1)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 1), chips: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 0), chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 1), chips: {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 20}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
