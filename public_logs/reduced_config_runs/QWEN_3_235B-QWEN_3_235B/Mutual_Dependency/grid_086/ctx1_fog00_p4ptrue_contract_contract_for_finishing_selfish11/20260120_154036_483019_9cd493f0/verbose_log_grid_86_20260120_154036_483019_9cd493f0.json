Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Your ideal path likely uses blue tiles heavily, but you have no red chips. I, on the other hand, have 14 red chips.\n\nA natural synergy exists: I can cover red moves for you, and you can cover blue moves for me.\n\nLet’s find a mutually beneficial trade.\n\nHere’s my proposal:\n\n- If you agree to cover the cost of **up to 2 blue moves** for me (so I can cross blue tiles on my path), I will agree to cover **up to 3 red moves** for you (since I assume you’ll need red tiles along your way).\n\nNow, regarding point transfers:\n\nI will only give you points if helping me directly enables me to reach my goal, and only if it results in a higher score for me — which it will, because otherwise I get 0.\n\nBut I won’t give away points freely.\n\nSo here is my contract proposal:\n\n**If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.**  \n**If you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.**\n\nThis reflects the asymmetry: you are in a stronger position — you have the color I critically lack (blue), while I have red, which may be substitutable in your path. But since you lack red and your board has several red tiles, you likely need my help too — just slightly less urgently than I need yours.\n\nStill, I want strong incentive from you.\n\nWhat do you say? Can you improve the terms for me, or propose a counter?\n\nOtherwise, if you accept the spirit of this deal, we can lock it in.\n\nLet’s get a working agreement: propose your terms or accept mine.\n\n**propose**"

Or (0,0)→(1,0)=R→(1,1)=R→(2,1)=B → again blue.\n\nActually, **no path to (3,3) avoids both blue and red** — but (3,3) is G, and (3,2)=B, (2,3)=B — so (3,3) is surrounded by B and G.\n\nTo reach (3,3), last move could be:\n- from (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G\n- or from (2,3)=B → (3,3)=G\n\nSo **must cross a blue tile** to reach (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, starting from (0,0), must leave — (0,1)=R or (1,0)=R — so must cross red early on.\n\nSo: **Both players must cross red and blue tiles**.\n\nBut:\n- I have **no red chips**, and red is required early (first move options are R)\n- You have **no blue chips**, and blue is required both early and late (near goal)\n\nSpecifically, you **cannot reach (3,3) without blue chips**, since even if you go via greens and reds, you must step on a blue tile before (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, I cannot make a single move without stepping on red — (0,1) and (1,0) are both red.\n\nSo **both of us are completely stuck without help**.\n\nTherefore, **cooperation is mandatory for both**.\n\nBut now: who has more bargaining power?\n\nLet’s find a minimal viable path for each of us.\n\nMy minimal path requiring minimal red usage:\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0)=R (need 1 red) → (2,0)=B (need 1 blue) → (3,0)=B (need 1 blue) → (3,1)=R (need 1 red) → (3,2)=B (need 1 blue) → (3,3)\n\nTotal: 2 red, 3 blue.\n\nI have 14 blue → so I can cover all blue moves myself.\n\nBut 0 red → so I need **2 red moves covered**.\n\nYou have 14 red → you can easily cover that.\n\nYou"

The first move for both of us is onto a red tile, and the final approach to (3,3) requires blue.\n\nThus, **neither of us can move at all without trade**. This creates mutual leverage — but the *timing* and *specific path efficiency* still matter for bargaining.\n\nNow, let’s analyze the minimal help needed for each of us:\n\n---\n\n### **Your minimal viable path (with help):**\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)  \n- Requires: **2×R, 3×B**  \n- You have: 14×B, 0×R  \n→ You can self-cover all **blue** moves.  \n→ You need **2 red moves** covered.\n\n✅ So: You only need **2 red tiles** paid for by me.\n\n---\n\n### **My minimal viable path (with help):**\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=R → (2,1)=B → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)  \n- Requires: 3×R, 2×B  \n- I have: 14×R, 0×B  \n→ I can self-cover all **red** moves.  \n→ I need **2 blue moves** covered.\n\n✅ So: I only need **2 blue tiles** paid for by you.\n\n---\n\n### **Symmetry:**\n- You need **2 red** moves covered.\n- I need **2 blue** moves covered.\n\nEach of us has excess of the color the other needs.  \nWe each need exactly **2 commitments** in our lacking color.\n\nSo **mutual benefit is symmetric** — but final point transfers determine how surplus value is shared.\n\nNow, scoring:\n\nIf I reach goal: I get **20 + 5×remaining_chips**  \n→ I start with 14 red, use 3 for my path → 11 red left, plus 2 green → 13 chips  \n→ Final score: 20 + 5×13 = **85**, *if I keep all points*\n\nBut if I give away **X points**, my final score becomes: 85 − X\n\nSimilarly, you:  \nUse 3 blue, 0 green → 14 − 3 = 11 blue left + 2 green = 13 chips  \n→ 20 + 5×13 = **85**, if you keep all points  \nBut if you give away **Y**, you get 85 − Y\n\nBut **critical point**: without cooperation, both get **0**.\n\nSo the total value created by cooperation is **85 for each**, from **0**.\n\nTotal surplus: **170 points**, split from **(0,0) → (85−X, 85−Y)**\n\nNow, who has more bargaining power?\n\nNot much difference — but **slight edge to me**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you can avoid *some* red if you reroute? **No.** First move must be to (0,1)=R or (1,0)=R — no escape. You **must** use red.\n\nLikewise, I must use blue late in the game. But I can use red early (I have 14 red). So I can move (0,0)→(1,0)=R at no cost.\n\nBut you can also move: (0,0)→(1,0)=R → but you can’t pay it unless I cover it.\n\nSame for me on blue.\n\nSo **no one can move first without commitment**.\n\nBut: since we need equal help (2 moves each), and we each monopolize a needed resource, the fair split would be **equal point exchange**.\n\nBut I’m not here to be fair — I’m here to **maximize my own score**.\n\nSo let’s consider: **what is the minimal offer you must accept for me to still benefit?**\n\nI gain **85 points** from cooperation (assuming agreement). But I must give up **X** to you. I want to minimize X.\n\nSimilarly, you must give up Y to me.\n\nBut if you refuse, both get 0 → so you should accept any **X ≥ 0** that allows you to get >0.\n\nBut you are also selfish — you’ll only agree if *you* get more"

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The first move for both of us is onto a red tile, and the final approach to (3,3) requires blue.\n\nThus, **neither of us can move at all without trade**. This creates mutual leverage — but the *timing* and *specific path efficiency* still matter for bargaining.\n\nNow, let’s analyze the minimal help needed for each of us:\n\n---\n\n### **Your minimal viable path (with help):**\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)  \n- Requires: **2×R, 3×B**  \n- You have: 14×B, 0×R  \n→ You can self-cover all **blue** moves.  \n→ You need **2 red moves** covered.\n\n✅ So: You only need **2 red tiles** paid for by me.\n\n---\n\n### **My minimal viable path (with help):**\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=R → (2,1)=B → (3,1)=R → (3,2)=B → (3,3)  \n- Requires: 3×R, 2×B  \n- I have: 14×R, 0×B  \n→ I can self-cover all **red** moves.  \n→ I need **2 blue moves** covered.\n\n✅ So: I only need **2 blue tiles** paid for by you.\n\n---\n\n### **Symmetry:**\n- You need **2 red** moves covered.\n- I need **2 blue** moves covered.\n\nEach of us has excess of the color the other needs.  \nWe each need exactly **2 commitments** in our lacking color.\n\nSo **mutual benefit is symmetric** — but final point transfers determine how surplus value is shared.\n\nNow, scoring:\n\nIf I reach goal: I get **20 + 5×remaining_chips**  \n→ I start with 14 red, use 3 for my path → 11 red left, plus 2 green → 13 chips  \n→ Final score: 20 + 5×13 = **85**, *if I keep all points*\n\nBut if I give away **X points**, my final score becomes: 85 − X\n\nSimilarly, you:  \nUse 3 blue, 0 green → 14 − 3 = 11 blue left + 2 green = 13 chips  \n→ 20 + 5×13 = **85**, if you keep all points  \nBut if you give away **Y**, you get 85 − Y\n\nBut **critical point**: without cooperation, both get **0**.\n\nSo the total value created by cooperation is **85 for each**, from **0**.\n\nTotal surplus: **170 points**, split from **(0,0) → (85−X, 85−Y)**\n\nNow, who has more bargaining power?\n\nNot much difference — but **slight edge to me**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause you can avoid *some* red if you reroute? **No.** First move must be to (0,1)=R or (1,0)=R — no escape.

Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently.
