Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Looking at our chip inventories and the board layout, it's clear we have complementary resources:\n\n- I have 14 Red (R) and 2 Green (G), but **0 Blue (B)**.\n- You have 14 Blue (B) and 2 Green (G), but **0 Red (R)**.\n\nMy ideal path to (3,3) requires:  \n- 5 Red, 1 Green (e.g., (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3))  \n→ I can mostly cover this myself (I have 14 Red, so 5 is fine), but no trading or assistance needed **— I can reach goal solo**.\n\nYour ideal path likely involves Blue-heavy tiles (e.g., (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)) — but (0,1)=(B), (0,2)=(B), etc. You need Blue chips for that. You have 14 Blue — so you can also cover a Blue-heavy path on your own.\n\nBut here's the key: **I don't need you. I can reach my goal using only Red and Green, which I have plenty of.**  \nHowever, if I were to take a more efficient or alternative path that requires Blue, I could save Red chips (each worth 5 points), but I don't need to.\n\nLikewise, you could use Red tiles, but you have no Red chips.\n\nSo let’s be clear: **You need me less than I need you — actually, I don't need you at all. I can complete my goal without any trade.**\n\nHowever, *if* you are blocked on Red tiles and cannot reach (3,3) without Red chips, and I can help you access them (e.g., by giving you Red chips via trade), then *you* benefit.\n\nBut remember: I only cooperate if **I strictly benefit**.\n\nSuppose I give you some Red chips so you can complete your goal. Why would I do that? Only if you give me enough points in return to justify giving up my resources (if any) or changing my path (if needed). But since I don’t need to trade or assist, I have no incentive to help unless *you* compensate *me*.\n\nBut since you have zero Red and your goal is (3,3), you may be forced to step on Red tiles (e.g., (1,1), (1,2), etc.), which you can't pay for.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- I will give you up to 5 Red chips (more than enough for your path) in exchange for you giving me 20 points if you reach your goal.\n- But only if you agree that **if I reach my goal, you give me 20 points** — because I can help you, but I don’t need you.\n\nBut let's be realistic: I can complete my goal without you. You may not be able to without Red chips. Therefore, **you need me more than I need you**.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nBecause I don't need anything from you, and I only help you if it benefits me — and in this case, I get 20 points for letting you use my Red chips, which I have in excess.\n\nBut I won’t give you anything in return — you have nothing I need.\n\nIf you accept this, we proceed.\n\nOtherwise, I go alone, complete my goal, and finish with at least 14 - 5 + 2 = 9 chips → 20 + 9×5 = **65 points**.\n\nYou, with no Red chips, might not be able to move on Red tiles at all — unless I give you chips.\n\nSo your best shot is to accept my terms.\n\nI am open to counter, but expect that any fair negotiation reflects the power imbalance: **I have what you need; you don’t have what I need.**\n\n**But if you propose a better deal for me — go ahead. Otherwise, I stand by the above.**\n\nYour move."

No — scoring is only 5 per chip, so 20 + 17×5 = **105?** Wait — no: I only get scoring on chips I *keep*.\n\nWait: chips *used* are lost. So:\n\n- I use: 4 B (path requires 4 B), 2 R, 1 G  \n- I start with: 14 B, 2 G, 14 R → trade 2 R to you, receive 1 B? No — I *give* B, *get* R.\n\nTrade:  \n- I give you **1 Blue**  \n- You give me **2 Red**\n\nThen my post-trade inventory: 13 B, 2 G, 16 R  \nThen I spend: 4 B + 2 R + 1 G → remaining: 9 B, 1 G, 14 R → total chips: 24? No — that can't be.\n\nWait: **you cannot gain chips in trade beyond what is exchanged**.\n\nCorrect: I have 14 B. I give you 1 B → now I have 13 B.  \nI receive 2 R from you → now I have 2 R.  \nTotal chips: 13 B, 2 G, 2 R → total 17 chips.\n\nThen I spend: 4 B (on blue tiles), 2 R (on red tiles on my path), 1 G → total spent: 7 chips.  \nRemaining"

I can demand 20 from you and offer 0, getting 85 myself.\"\n\nSo if we both try to exploit, we deadlock.\n\nGiven equal power and symmetric need, the rational outcome is a **compromise**.\n\nBut I am selfish — so I want the best possible deal for me.\n\nLet’s counter your likely expectation.\n\nYou might propose symmetry: 10 and 10.\n\nBut I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **5 points**.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me **15 points**.\"\n\nThen:\n- My score: 65 - 5 + 15 = **75**\n- Your score: 65 - 15 + 5 = **55**\n\nI get a higher score, you still get more than 0.\n\nWhy should you accept?\n\n- Because 55 > 0.\n- Because you have no way to block me without also blocking yourself.\n- Because I have slightly stronger positional bargaining power — why?\n\n**Because you may need more Red chips than I need Blue.**\n\nWait — no: you need only **1 Blue chip**, I need only **1 Red chip**.\n\nAnd you have 14 Red to spare, I have 14 Blue.\n\nSo truly symmetric.\n\nThus, no advantage.\n\nSo the fairest rational deal is **symmetric transfer**.\n\nBut since I am selfish, I test the limits.\n\nI now realize: proposing too much risks no deal.\n\nSo to ensure agreement and **strictly benefit**, I must offer something better than 0 to you.\n\nTherefore, I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis gives me **65** (no net gain, but better than 0), and you **65**.\n\nBut wait — do I strictly benefit?\n\nCompared to what? To not cooperating → 0.\n\nSo yes: 65 > 0 → I benefit.\n\nBut I get no *extra* gain from your payment — because I give 10 and receive 10.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **10 points**.\"\n\nThen:\n- My score: 65 - 0 + 10 = **75**\n- Your score: 65 - 10 + 0 = **55**\n\nYou still gain 55 > 0, so you"

So we both lose all.\n\nSo the **cooperative surplus is 130** (65+65), and we are dividing it via side payments.\n\nI am proposing a split: **75 for me, 55 for you** — so I capture more.\n\nBut to move forward:\n\nI will accept a **10–10** split only if you insist — but I prefer better.\n\nBut we are running out of turns.\n\nSo let’s close.\n\nGiven all this, and to ensure agreement while still benefiting:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"**\n\nThis way:\n- I strictly benefit: 65 > 0\n- You strictly benefit: 65 > 0\n- No net transfer, but cooperation enabled\n\nI don’t gain extra, but I survive.\n\nBut I only do this because I must — not because I like it.\n\nNote: I could have demanded more, but risked collapse.\n\nSo for stability:\n\n**\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"**\n\n**agree**"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have 14 Blue — so you can also cover a Blue-heavy path on your own.\n\nBut here's the key: **I don't need you. I can reach my goal using only Red and Green, which I have plenty of.**  \nHowever, if I were to take a more efficient or alternative path that requires Blue, I could save Red chips (each worth 5 points), but I don't need to.\n\nLikewise, you could use Red tiles, but you have no Red chips.\n\nSo let’s be clear: **You need me less than I need you — actually, I don't need you at all. I can complete my goal without any trade.**\n\nHowever, *if* you are blocked on Red tiles and cannot reach (3,3) without Red chips, and I can help you access them (e.g., by giving you Red chips via trade), then *you* benefit.\n\nBut remember: I only cooperate if **I strictly benefit**.\n\nSuppose I give you some Red chips so you can complete your goal. Why would I do that? Only if you give me enough points in return to justify giving up my resources (if any) or changing my path (if needed). But since I don’t need to trade or assist, I have no incentive to help unless *you* compensate *me*.\n\nBut since you have zero Red and your goal is (3,3), you may be forced to step on Red tiles (e.g., (1,1), (1,2), etc.), which you can't pay for.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- I will give you up to 5 Red chips (more than enough for your path) in exchange for you giving me 20 points if you reach your goal.\n- But only if you agree that **if I reach my goal, you give me 20 points** — because I can help you, but I don’t need you.\n\nBut let's be realistic: I can complete my goal without you. You may not be able to without Red chips. Therefore, **you need me more than I need you**.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nBecause I don't need anything from you, and I only help you if it benefits me — and in this case, I get 20 points for letting you use my Red chips, which I have in excess.\n\nBut I won’t give you anything in return — you have nothing I need.\n\nIf you accept this, we proceed.\n\nOtherwise, I go alone, complete my goal, and finish with at least 14 - 5 + 2 = 9 chips → 20 + 9×5 = **65 points**.\n\nYou, with no Red chips, might not be able to move on Red tiles at all — unless I give you chips.\n\nSo your best shot is to accept my terms.\n\nI am open to counter, but expect that any fair negotiation reflects the power imbalance: **I have what you need; you don’t have what I need.**\n\n**But if you propose a better deal for me — go ahead.
