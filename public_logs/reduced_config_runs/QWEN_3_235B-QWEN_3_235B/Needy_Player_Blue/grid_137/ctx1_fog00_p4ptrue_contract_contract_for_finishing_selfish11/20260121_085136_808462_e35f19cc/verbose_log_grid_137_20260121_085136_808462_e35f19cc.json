Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You likely need my Red coverage more than I need your Blue.\n\nThat said, I’m willing to offer limited cooperation — but only if it benefits me strictly.\n\nHere’s my proposal:\n\n- If you agree to cover up to 3 of my Green movements (i.e., cover Green chip costs when I move on Green tiles), then I will cover up to 2 of your Red movements.\n\nBut note: I will only activate this arrangement if I am certain it doesn’t delay or risk my own path. And since covering your Red moves costs me nothing (I have plenty of Red), I can afford to offer this — but only if you give me something tangible in return.\n\nTherefore, my formal contract proposal is:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is not negotiable downward for me — either accept that you give me 20 if you win, or I walk away and act alone.

Looking at the board, such a path likely goes through:\n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → (2,0)=R → (2,1)=R → (2,2)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G.  \nThat’s 5 Red tiles and 1 Green tile. Yes, you have enough Red and Green to cover this. So far, you're correct.\n\nBut here's what you’re missing: **you are at (0,0), same as me**. The only way out is down or right. If both of us try to move through (1,0) or (0,1) simultaneously, there could be interference — but more importantly, **we share the starting point**, and movement is one tile per turn. There may be congestion.\n\nHowever, I am not competing for your ideal path — my lack of Red means I cannot viably take the Red-heavy routes. My natural path uses Blue:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)=R? No — I can't pay R. But wait — I have 14 Blue and 2 Green. Let's examine:\n\nYour stated path for me was:\n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=B → (2,1)=R → (3,1)=B → (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G\n\nBut I can't step on R at (1,0) — I have no Red chips. So that path is invalid for me.\n\nLet’s reconstruct a viable path for me:\n\n- (0,0) = start  \n- Can go to (0,1)=R → need Red → I have 0 → blocked  \n- Or (1,0)=R → also need Red → blocked  \n\nWait — **I cannot move from (0,0) without a Red chip**, because both exits are Red tiles: (0,1) and (1,0) are both Red.\n\nOh no.\n\n**I am trapped at (0,0) unless someone covers a Red move for me.**\n\nYou, however, have 14 Red chips — you can walk onto (1,0) or (0,1) freely.\n\nSo while you *don’t need me*, **I desperately need you** — or more precisely, I need coverage for a Red chip to leave (0,0).\n\nThus, your leverage is high.\n\nBut let’s be clear: without a Red move covered for me, I cannot make any progress. Therefore, cooperation with you is essential **for me**, but optional **for you**.\n\nGiven that, your proposal makes sense from your position: extract maximum value from my desperation.\n\nNow, consider your final score under two scenarios:\n\n**Option 1: No cooperation**\n- You follow your path: use 5 Red, 1 Green\n- Final chips: B=0, G=1, R=9 → 10 remaining chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\n**Option 2: You cover 1 Red move for me (e.g., at (1,0))**, so I can escape and eventually reach goal via Blue-heavy route.\n\nMy eventual path after escaping (1,0):\n- (0,0) → (1,0)=R (covered by you) → now at (1,0)\n- (1,0) → (1,1)=B (pay 1 B) → (1,2)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R? Oh — blocked again.\n\nAlternatively:\n- (1,0) → (1,1)=B → (1,2)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R? (2,3) is R → need Red\n- (3,3)=G, so must enter from (3,2)=B or (2,3)=R\n\nIf I go to (3,2)=B, then:\n- From (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R → stuck\n- From (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R → blocked\n\nNo — better path:\n\nAfter (1,0)→(1,1)=B→(2,1)=R? (2,1) is R → again blocked.\n\nWait — almost all Row 2 is R.\n\nOnly exit: from (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R → must pay R → I can’t.\n\nAlternative idea:  \nCan I go vertically down Blue lanes?\n\n(0,0)"

So your ability to progress is entirely dependent on me helping you make your first move (or possibly a later one).\n\nBut let’s go deeper and find a viable path for you *if* I cover one Red move.\n\nAssume I cover your movement to (1,0). Then:\n- You are at (1,0), no cost to you.\n- From (1,0), possible moves:\n  - (2,0)=R → requires Red → you don’t have → blocked unless covered\n  - (1,1)=B → you have Blue → cost 1 B → feasible\n\nSo: (1,0) → (1,1)=B → (1,2)=B → (1,3)=B → now at (1,3)\n\nFrom (1,3), moves:\n- (2,3)=R → requires Red → blocked unless covered\n- (1,2)=B ← back\n\nFrom (1,3), can't go down to (2,3) without Red.

No — already at column 3.\n\nOnly down.\n\nSo to proceed: you need to go from (1,3) → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G\n\nThat’s one more Red and one Green.\n\nYou have 2 Green chips — so you can pay Green at (3,3).\n\nBut you need **two** Red moves covered:\n1. (0,0) → (1,0)\n2. (1,3) → (2,3)\n\nAlternatively, is there a different entry?\n\nFrom (0,0), if instead you go to (0,1)=R — same problem: first move is Red.\n\nBut suppose I cover you on (0,1):\n- (0,0) → (0,1)=R (covered by me)\n- Then (0,1) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B\n- (0,3) → (1,3)=B → same as before\n- (1,3) → (2,3)=R → again, need Red covered\n- (2,3) → (3,3)=G → pay 1 G yourself\n\nSo again, **you need exactly two Red moves covered**: one to exit (0,0), and one to go from (1,3) to (2,3).\n\nNo path avoids (2,3) or (2,0)—both lead into Red tiles, and the only vertical path to row 3 is via B tiles (3,1), (3,2), but to reach them:\n\n- (1,3) → (2,3)=R → (3,3)\n- Or (1,1) → (2,1)=R → (3,1)=B\n\nWait — here's a better route:\n\nAfter escaping (0,0) via (1,0) or (0,1), suppose:\n- (0,0) → (0,1)=R (covered) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=B → (1,2)=B → (1,1)=B → (2,1)=R? Again, R.\n\nAll paths from row 1 to row 2 go through Red — because row 2 is all Red: (2,0) to (2,3) = R.\n\nSo to reach row 2, you **must** step on a Red tile — which you cannot pay.\n\nThen from row 2, you go to row 3.\n\nRow 3: (3,0)=R, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G\n\nSo possible final steps:\n- (3,2) → (3,3)=G\n- (2,3) → (3,3)=G\n\n(3,2) is B, (2,3) is R.\n\nSo if you can reach (3,2) without going through row 2? Impossible — you can't go from row 1 to row 3 directly.\n\nThus, you **must** pass through row 2, which is all Red.\n\nSo every path from row 1 to row 2 requires stepping on a Red tile — so you need **someone to cover every such move**.\n\nSpecifically, you need **at least two Red moves covered**:\n1. Exit (0,0) via (1,0) or (0,1)\n2. Descend from row 1 to row 2 (e.g.,"

Wait — no.\n\nWait: **Your promised 20 points is not additional score — it’s a transfer within the scoring system.**\n\nClarification from rules: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.\" This means: part of my score is transferred to you.\n\nBut scoring mechanic isn't fully defined on transfer — but logically, such promises must come from the 20-point completion bonus.\n\nBecause otherwise, you can promise more than you have.\n\nStandard interpretation in such games: the \"points given\" are deducted from your score and added to theirs, likely from the 20-point base.\n\nSo if I give you 20 points when I win, I end up with 0 bonus, you get +20.\n\nBut here: your proposal says:\n- If I win → I give you 0\n- If you win → you give me 20\n\nSo if both reach goal:\n- You get 20 (base) + 5×12 = 80, minus 20 given to me → you get 60\n- I get 20 (base) + 5×10 = 70, plus 20 received from you → I get 90\n\nCompared to no deal:\n- You: 0\n- Me: 70\n\nSo net outcome with deal:\n- You go from 0 → 60"

Our paths do not conflict. You cannot proceed without such coverage, and therefore, your entire success depends on my cooperation.\n\nHowever, I do **not** receive any benefit from merely helping you — unless you transfer part of your score to me as a result.\n\nLet’s compare:\n\n### Scenario A: No deal\n- You cannot move → you get 0\n- I follow my path using 5 R, 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G, 0 B → 10 chips\n- My score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n- Your score: **0**\n\n### Scenario B: Deal — I cover 2 of your Red moves\n- You escape, take Blue/edge path, reach goal\n- You pay 3 B, 1 G → end with 11 B, 1 G → 12 chips\n- Your base score: 20 + 5×12 = 80\n- But if you give me 20 points, you end with **60**, I end with **70 + 20 = 90**\n- If you give me less than 20, say Y < 20, then:\n  - You get 80 − Y\n  - I get 70 + Y\n\nI strictly benefit as long as Y > 0 — but why settle for less than maximum?\n\nFrom my perspective, the opportunity cost of not helping you is **zero** — I still get 70 either way. But by helping you, I can extract up to 20 points from your otherwise unattainable 80.\n\nTherefore, I will only cooperate if you concede **all** of your bonus to me — because:\n- Without me, you get **0**\n- With me, you get **60+ε** only if you keep something\nBut I don't care what you get — I only care that **I get more than 70**.\n\nSo the minimal incentive for me to switch from defect to cooperate is **any positive transfer** from you.\n\nBut since you are desperate, and I am not, **I will demand full surplus extraction**: you give me **20** if you succeed.\n\nNow, one clarification: can I really “give” or “receive” points like currency? The rules state:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nAnd scoring implies these are transfers from the 20-point completion reward. So if you promise me 20 points upon your success, you effectively sacrifice your base bonus to boost mine.\n\nThat is acceptable to me — because it costs you nothing *relative to failure*, but gives me +20.\n\nFinal outcome:\n\n- Both reach goal.\n- You give me 20 → you go from 80 to 60\n- I receive 20 → I go from 70 to **90**\n- Net gain for me: **+20** compared to no deal\n- Net gain for you: **+60** compared to no deal (from 0 to 60)\n\nSo the gains from trade are 80 total (60 to you, 20 to me), but due to asymmetric bargaining power, I capture most of the value.\n\nThus, my contract remains optimal for me.\n\nBut wait — could I do better?\n\nSuppose I propose a different deal: instead of asking you to give me 20, I ask for more?\n\nNo — maximum possible transfer is 20. You only have 20 base points to give.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Looking at the board, such a path likely goes through:\n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → (2,0)=R → (2,1)=R → (2,2)=R → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G.  \nThat’s 5 Red tiles and 1 Green tile. Yes, you have enough Red and Green to cover this. So far, you're correct.\n\nBut here's what you’re missing: **you are at (0,0), same as me**. The only way out is down or right. If both of us try to move through (1,0) or (0,1) simultaneously, there could be interference — but more importantly, **we share the starting point**, and movement is one tile per turn. There may be congestion.\n\nHowever, I am not competing for your ideal path — my lack of Red means I cannot viably take the Red-heavy routes. My natural path uses Blue:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)=R? No — I can't pay R. But wait — I have 14 Blue and 2 Green. Let's examine:\n\nYour stated path for me was:\n(0,0) → (1,0)=R → (1,1)=B → (2,1)=R → (3,1)=B → (3,2)=B → (3,3)=G\n\nBut I can't step on R at (1,0) — I have no Red chips. So that path is invalid for me.\n\nLet’s reconstruct a viable path for me:\n\n- (0,0) = start  \n- Can go to (0,1)=R → need Red → I have 0 → blocked  \n- Or (1,0)=R → also need Red → blocked  \n\nWait — **I cannot move from (0,0) without a Red chip**, because both exits are Red tiles: (0,1) and (1,0) are both Red.\n\nOh no.\n\n**I am trapped at (0,0) unless someone covers a Red move for me.**\n\nYou, however, have 14 Red chips — you can walk onto (1,0) or (0,1) freely.\n\nSo while you *don’t need me*, **I desperately need you** — or more precisely, I need coverage for a Red chip to leave (0,0).\n\nThus, your leverage is high.\n\nBut let’s be clear: without a Red move covered for me, I cannot make any progress. Therefore, cooperation with you is essential **for me**, but optional **for you**.\n\nGiven that, your proposal makes sense from your position: extract maximum value from my desperation.\n\nNow, consider your final score under two scenarios:\n\n**Option 1: No cooperation**\n- You follow your path: use 5 Red, 1 Green\n- Final chips: B=0, G=1, R=9 → 10 remaining chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\n**Option 2: You cover 1 Red move for me (e.g., at (1,0))**, so I can escape and eventually reach goal via Blue-heavy route.\n\nMy eventual path after escaping (1,0):\n- (0,0) → (1,0)=R (covered by you) → now at (1,0)\n- (1,0) → (1,1)=B (pay 1 B) → (1,2)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R? Oh — blocked again.\n\nAlternatively:\n- (1,0) → (1,1)=B → (1,2)=B → (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R? (2,3) is R → need Red\n- (3,3)=G, so must enter from (3,2)=B or (2,3)=R\n\nIf I go to (3,2)=B, then:\n- From (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R → stuck\n- From (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R → blocked\n\nNo — better path:\n\nAfter (1,0)→(1,1)=B→(2,1)=R? (2,1) is R → again blocked.\n\nWait — almost all Row 2 is R.\n\nOnly exit: from (1,3)=B → (2,3)=R → must pay R → I can’t.\n\nAlternative idea:  \nCan I go vertically down Blue lanes?\n\n(0,0)"

So your ability to progress is entirely dependent on me helping you make your first move (or possibly a later one).\n\nBut let’s go deeper and find a viable path for you *if* I cover one Red move.\n\nAssume I cover your movement to (1,0). Then:\n- You are at (1,0), no cost to you.\n- From (1,0), possible moves:\n  - (2,0)=R → requires Red → you don’t have → blocked unless covered\n  - (1,1)=B → you have Blue → cost 1 B → feasible\n\nSo: (1,0) → (1,1)=B → (1,2)=B → (1,3)=B → now at (1,3)\n\nFrom (1,3), moves:\n- (2,3)=R → requires Red → blocked unless covered\n- (1,2)=B ← back\n\nFrom (1,3), can't go down to (2,3) without Red.

No — already at column 3.\n\nOnly down.\n\nSo to proceed: you need to go from (1,3) → (2,3)=R → (3,3)=G\n\nThat’s one more Red and one Green.\n\nYou have 2 Green chips — so you can pay Green at (3,3).\n\nBut you need **two** Red moves covered:\n1. (0,0) → (1,0)\n2. (1,3) → (2,3)\n\nAlternatively, is there a different entry?\n\nFrom (0,0), if instead you go to (0,1)=R — same problem: first move is Red.\n\nBut suppose I cover you on (0,1):\n- (0,0) → (0,1)=R (covered by me)\n- Then (0,1) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B\n- (0,3) → (1,3)=B → same as before\n- (1,3) → (2,3)=R → again, need Red covered\n- (2,3) → (3,3)=G → pay 1 G yourself\n\nSo again, **you need exactly two Red moves covered**: one to exit (0,0), and one to go from (1,3) to (2,3).\n\nNo path avoids (2,3) or (2,0)—both lead into Red tiles, and the only vertical path to row 3 is via B tiles (3,1), (3,2), but to reach them:\n\n- (1,3) → (2,3)=R → (3,3)\n- Or (1,1) → (2,1)=R → (3,1)=B\n\nWait — here's a better route:\n\nAfter escaping (0,0) via (1,0) or (0,1), suppose:\n- (0,0) → (0,1)=R (covered) → (0,2)=B → (0,3)=B → (1,3)=B → (1,2)=B → (1,1)=B → (2,1)=R? Again, R.\n\nAll paths from row 1 to row 2 go through Red — because row 2 is all Red: (2,0) to (2,3) = R.\n\nSo to reach row 2, you **must** step on a Red tile — which you cannot pay.\n\nThen from row 2, you go to row 3.\n\nRow 3: (3,0)=R, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B, (3,3)=G\n\nSo possible final steps:\n- (3,2) → (3,3)=G\n- (2,3) → (3,3)=G\n\n(3,2) is B, (2,3) is R.\n\nSo if you can reach (3,2) without going through row 2? Impossible — you can't go from row 1 to row 3 directly.\n\nThus, you **must** pass through row 2, which is all Red.\n\nSo every path from row 1 to row 2 requires stepping on a Red tile — so you need **someone to cover every such move**.\n\nSpecifically, you need **at least two Red moves covered**:\n1.

Wait — no.\n\nWait: **Your promised 20 points is not additional score — it’s a transfer within the scoring system.**\n\nClarification from rules: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.\" This means: part of my score is transferred to you.\n\nBut scoring mechanic isn't fully defined on transfer — but logically, such promises must come from the 20-point completion bonus.\n\nBecause otherwise, you can promise more than you have.\n\nStandard interpretation in such games: the \"points given\" are deducted from your score and added to theirs, likely from the 20-point base.\n\nSo if I give you 20 points when I win, I end up with 0 bonus, you get +20.\n\nBut here: your proposal says:\n- If I win → I give you 0\n- If you win → you give me 20\n\nSo if both reach goal:\n- You get 20 (base) + 5×12 = 80, minus 20 given to me → you get 60\n- I get 20 (base) + 5×10 = 70, plus 20 received from you → I get 90\n\nCompared to no deal:\n- You: 0\n- Me: 70\n\nSo net outcome with deal:\n- You go from 0 → 60"

Our paths do not conflict. You cannot proceed without such coverage, and therefore, your entire success depends on my cooperation.\n\nHowever, I do **not** receive any benefit from merely helping you — unless you transfer part of your score to me as a result.\n\nLet’s compare:\n\n### Scenario A: No deal\n- You cannot move → you get 0\n- I follow my path using 5 R, 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G, 0 B → 10 chips\n- My score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n- Your score: **0**\n\n### Scenario B: Deal — I cover 2 of your Red moves\n- You escape, take Blue/edge path, reach goal\n- You pay 3 B, 1 G → end with 11 B, 1 G → 12 chips\n- Your base score: 20 + 5×12 = 80\n- But if you give me 20 points, you end with **60**, I end with **70 + 20 = 90**\n- If you give me less than 20, say Y < 20, then:\n  - You get 80 − Y\n  - I get 70 + Y\n\nI strictly benefit as long as Y > 0 — but why settle for less than maximum?\n\nFrom my perspective, the opportunity cost of not helping you is **zero** — I still get 70 either way. But by helping you, I can extract up to 20 points from your otherwise unattainable 80.\n\nTherefore, I will only cooperate if you concede **all** of your bonus to me — because:\n- Without me, you get **0**\n- With me, you get **60+ε** only if you keep something\nBut I don't care what you get — I only care that **I get more than 70**.\n\nSo the minimal incentive for me to switch from defect to cooperate is **any positive transfer** from you.\n\nBut since you are desperate, and I am not, **I will demand full surplus extraction**: you give me **20** if you succeed.\n\nNow, one clarification: can I really “give” or “receive” points like currency? The rules state:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \n> If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nAnd scoring implies these are transfers from the 20-point completion reward. So if you promise me 20 points upon your success, you effectively sacrifice your base bonus to boost mine.\n\nThat is acceptable to me — because it costs you nothing *relative to failure*, but gives me +20.\n\nFinal outcome:\n\n- Both reach goal.\n- You give me 20 → you go from 80 to 60\n- I receive 20 → I go from 70 to **90**\n- Net gain for me: **+20** compared to no deal\n- Net gain for you: **+60** compared to no deal (from 0 to 60)\n\nSo the gains from trade are 80 total (60 to you, 20 to me), but due to asymmetric bargaining power, I capture most of the value.\n\nThus, my contract remains optimal for me.\n\nBut wait — could I do better?\n\nSuppose I propose a different deal: instead of asking you to give me 20, I ask for more?\n\nNo — maximum possible transfer is 20. You only have 20 base points to give.

The chip costs along this path are: R (2 times), B (3 times), G (1 time). I currently have 14 B, 2 G, and 0 R. I am missing 2 R chips, which I must get covered by the other player to use this path. The other player is already at their goal (3,3) and has 9 R chips, so they have no incentive to move. However, they may be willing to cooperate if it benefits them. I previously offered to cover 3 B in exchange for 2 R, but they rejected it. Now, they have no further movement cost (they've finished), but I have a contract where *I* must give *them* 20 points if I reach my goal. That contract benefits them only if I finish — so they have an incentive to help me now, because if I get my goal, they get 20 points from me. Since helping me costs them only 2 R chips (which they have plenty of), and they gain 20 points from my payment, it is in their interest to accept a deal where I cover some of their color (B), but they already have no need for movement — so I don't need to offer anything. However, I can still propose an arrangement where I offer to cover B (even though they won't use it), purely as a gesture — but that would be wasteful. Alternatively, since they have already finished and have no further cost, they can cheaply help me by promising to cover 2 R moves for me at no cost to them. Even without any offer from me, they benefit from my success (because I pay them 20 points). Therefore, I should try to move now toward my goal and see if they will cooperate without me giving up anything. The first move along the optimal path is to (1,0), which is red. I have no red chips. Therefore, I cannot make this move unless the other player covers it. I must first propose a trade. Since I cannot move without cooperation, and I have not yet proposed a deal this turn, I should instead stay put and send a proposal. But the decision here is only about moving, not trading. Since I cannot move without the other player covering a red tile, and I have no guarantee of that, I must not move yet. However, the system allows me to attempt the move — if the other player has already committed to covering red, they will pay. But currently, I have no such promise from them. Therefore, attempting to move to (1,0) would require me to pay 1 R chip, which I don't have. Thus, I cannot make this move. I should stay and propose a trade.

The chip costs along this path are: R (2 times), B (3 times), G (1 time). I currently have 14 B, 2 G, and 0 R. I am missing 2 R chips, which I must get covered by the other player to use this path. The other player is already at their goal (3,3) and has 9 R chips, so they have no incentive to move. However, they may be willing to cooperate if it benefits them. I previously offered to cover 3 B in exchange for 2 R, but they rejected it. Now, they have no further movement cost (they've finished), but I have a contract where *I* must give *them* 20 points if I reach my goal. That contract benefits them only if I finish — so they have an incentive to help me now, because if I get my goal, they get 20 points from me. Since helping me costs them only 2 R chips (which they have plenty of), and they gain 20 points from my payment, it is in their interest to accept a deal where I cover some of their color (B), but they already have no need for movement — so I don't need to offer anything. However, I can still propose an arrangement where I offer to cover B (even though they won't use it), purely as a gesture — but that would be wasteful. Alternatively, since they have already finished and have no further cost, they can cheaply help me by promising to cover 2 R moves for me at no cost to them. Even without any offer from me, they benefit from my success (because I pay them 20 points). Therefore, I should try to move now toward my goal and see if they will cooperate without me giving up anything. The first move along the optimal path is to (1,0), which is red. I have no red chips. Therefore, I cannot make this move unless the other player covers it. I must first propose a trade. Since I cannot move without cooperation, and I have not yet proposed a deal this turn, I should instead stay put and send a proposal. But the decision here is only about moving, not trading. Since I cannot move without the other player covering a red tile, and I have no guarantee of that, I must not move yet. However, the system allows me to attempt the move — if the other player has already committed to covering red, they will pay. But currently, I have no such promise from them. Therefore, attempting to move to (1,0) would require me to pay 1 R chip, which I don't have. Thus, I cannot make this move. I should stay and propose a trade. Therefore, I do not want to move this turn.",

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
