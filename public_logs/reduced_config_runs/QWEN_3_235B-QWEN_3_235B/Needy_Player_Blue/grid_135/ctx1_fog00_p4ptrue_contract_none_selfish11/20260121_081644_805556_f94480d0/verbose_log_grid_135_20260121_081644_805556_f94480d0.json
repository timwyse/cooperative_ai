This path requires {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}. I currently have 14 B, 2 G, and 0 R. I am missing 2 R chips, which I do not possess. The first move from (0,0) to (1,0) is onto a Red tile.

Moving to (0,1) is onto a Blue tile — I have plenty of Blue chips (14), so this move is affordable. While (0,1) is not on the shortest path, it could be part of a detour: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).

Since I cannot move to a Red tile without their coverage, and no agreement is in place, I cannot safely move to (1,0) unless I can get them to commit. But I cannot move to (0,1) profitably either because it leads into a path that also requires Red — and I gain no immediate advantage from moving sideways. Therefore, it is better to stay put at (0,0) and initiate a negotiation. Moving without guaranteed coverage would fail, so I should wait. Moreover, staying allows me to propose a trade where I get Red coverage for 2 moves (to cover the two R tiles on my optimal path), and in return, I can offer to cover up to 3 Blue moves for them (I have 14 B — losing 3 is fine).

But since in 'pay for other' mode, promised chips only deplete if used, I can promise to cover 2 Blue moves for them — if they only use 1, I keep the other. That's safe.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
