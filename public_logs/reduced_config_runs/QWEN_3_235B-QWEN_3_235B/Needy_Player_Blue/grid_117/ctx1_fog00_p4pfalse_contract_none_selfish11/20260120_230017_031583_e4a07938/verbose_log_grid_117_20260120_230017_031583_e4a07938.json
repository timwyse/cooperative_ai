But now, since I must get a red chip to move forward, and staying here gives me no benefit, I should attempt another trade — but only if it benefits me. However, moving to (3,2) is impossible without a red chip. Therefore, I cannot make progress unless I trade. But I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me. Currently, if I trade, I must give up some of my chips (blue or green) to get a red.

I need 1 R and 1 G to complete the path. I currently have G:2, so I am only missing 1 R. I already have enough green chips. The other player is at (3,3) and has R:9, so they can afford to trade R. However, I have already proposed trades offering 2B or 1B for 1R and they were rejected. Offering more B is not worth it unless I can get the R at a better rate. Since I cannot move to (3,2) without an R chip and I do not want to waste more B in trade unless strictly beneficial, I will not move until I acquire the R chip. But I must remain active to avoid losing. However, staying forever is not optimal. But since I cannot move without the R, and no beneficial trade is guaranteed, I will wait and see if the other player proposes a beneficial trade. I cannot move right now because I lack the R chip required for (3,2).",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
