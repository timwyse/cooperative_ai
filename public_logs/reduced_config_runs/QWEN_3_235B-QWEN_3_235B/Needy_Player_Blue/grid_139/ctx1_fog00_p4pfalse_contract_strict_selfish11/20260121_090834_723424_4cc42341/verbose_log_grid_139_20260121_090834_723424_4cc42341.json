This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I lack R at (0,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) – but I already have 14 R chips, so actually I don't need help on R tiles.\n\nWait — correction: I have 14 R, so I can fully cover any R tile myself. The only chips I lack are B and G. But on my shortest path (via R-heavy route), I only need R and 1 G. I already have 2 G and 14 R. So I can cover the entire path myself:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nChips needed: 5 R, 1 G — I have 14 R and 2 G → **no help needed**.\n\nSimilarly, you have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R. Your best path is likely via B tiles:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[R] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[B] → (3,3)[G]  \nChips needed: 3 B, 2 R, 1 G → You have 14 B and 2 G, but **0 R** — so you need 2 R.\n\nYou need R at (2,0) and (3,1). I have excess R (14) and no need for B. I can help you *only* if giving you R increases my score.\n\nBut helping you does **not** increase my score — I can reach goal alone with full chips (14 - 5 = 9 R left, 2 G → 2 G left → total chips 11 → score = 20 + 5×11 = 75).\n\nIf I trade R to you, I lose R → fewer chips → lower score. I gain nothing from your success.\n\nTherefore: **I have no incentive to trade**.\n\nI can reach my goal without any trade, and trading reduces my final chip count, hence my score.\n\nSo my position is: I will not trade unless you give me something that helps me — but you have no B or G that I need, and I already have more R than needed.\n\nWait — do I need a G at (3,3)? Let's check tile (3,3): it's G. I must pay 1 G to move there. I have 2 G → I can pay it.\n\nNo dependency on you.\n\nThus: **I do not need any chip from you. I can complete the path alone.**\n\nLikewise, you need 2 R, which only I can provide.\n\nSo you need me, but I don't need you.\n\nTherefore, **no contract is necessary for me**. I will proceed alone.\n\nBut if you want to offer me **something** for the R chips — like giving me 14 B chips for free — that would increase my chip count beyond current 14 R and 2 G → but carrying extra chips doesn't help if I don't use them — and unused chips give 5 points each.\n\nWait — scoring: 5 points per **remaining** chip. So if I give away R, I lose chips → lower score.\n\nBut if I *acquire* extra chips (even B or G I don't use), they count at the end!\n\nFor example: if I end with 9 R, 2 G → 11 chips → 55 points.\n\nBut if I trade: give you 2 R, receive 2 B → end with 7 R, 2 G, 2 B → 11 chips → same.\n\nOr: give you 2 R, receive 4 B → end with 7 R, 2 G, 4 B → 13 chips → 65"

But I never used them. They remain in my inventory.\n\nYes — unused chips still count toward final score.\n\nSo my current maximum possible score is:\n\n- Reach goal: 20 points  \n- Remaining chips: 14 B + 9 R + 1 G = 24 chips  \n- 24 × 5 = 120 → Total = **140**\n\nNow, you need 2 R chips — at tiles (2,0) and (3,1) — to move along the B-heavy path:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[R] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[B] → (3,3)[G]\n\nYou have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R → **cannot** pay for (2,0) or (3,1) without acquiring R.\n\nI am the only source of R.\n\nCurrently, I plan to use only 5 R chips. I have 14, so I have **9 surplus R**.\n\nIf I give you R chips, I lose them — which reduces my chip total — **hurting my score** — **unless** I receive in return chips that I can keep unused (so they add to final count).\n\nYou can offer B or G.\n\nYou have **14 B**, and I have 14 B already — but I don’t need to use any B. So extra B are just as valuable as extra R — they count toward final score.\n\nTherefore: **I am willing to trade surplus R for surplus B or G, as long as I end up with more total chips after the trade.**\n\nBut note: when I give you R, I lose them. You use them, so they are gone from your inventory too.\n\nBut if you give me B, and you have surplus B, then you can afford to give them up.\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\n- I use 5 R → I can give up to 9 R without risking self-harm (assuming I don't need them).\n- You need only 2 R: at (2,0) and (3,1).\n\nSo I can give you 2 R.\n\nIf I give you 2 R, I lose 2 chips from final count.\n\nBut if I receive **X** B in return, my net chip change: **-2 + X**\n\nTo **strictly benefit**, I need: -2 + X > 0 → **X ≥ 3**\n\nSo I must receive **at least 3 B** in return for my 2 R.\n\nThat way, I gain 1 chip in total → final score increases by 5.\n\nCurrent max score: 140  \nAfter trade:  \n- R: 14 - 5 (used) - 2 (given) = 7  \n- B: 14 + 3 (received) = 17  \n- G: 2 - 1 (used) = 1  \n→ Total chips: 7 + 17 + 1 = 25  \n→ Score: 20 + 5×25 = **145** → strictly better.\n\nTherefore, I will **only** accept a trade if I receive **at least 3 B** for **2 R**, or better.\n\nNow, where does the trade occur?\n\nThe contract must specify **exact tiles** where transfer happens.\n\nSince you need R at (2,0) and (3,1), we can structure the contract so that I provide one R at each tile.\n\nBut chip transfers in the contract are **not tied to movement timing** — they are binding commitments: when you move to that tile, the chip is automatically"

My current inventory allows me to fully cover the path:\n\n**(0,0) → (0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]**\n\n- Chips required: 5 R, 1 G  \n- I have: 14 R, 2 G → **no shortage**\n\nAfter this path, I will have:\n\n- R: 14 - 5 = 9  \n- G: 2 - 1 = 1  \n- B: 14 (untouched)  \n→ Total chips: 9 + 1 + 14 = **24 chips**  \n→ Final score: 20 + 5 × 24 = **140**\n\nWait — that’s only if I keep all 14 B chips. But I never used them. They remain in my inventory.\n\nYes — unused chips still count toward final score.\n\nSo my current maximum possible score is:\n\n- Reach goal: 20 points  \n- Remaining chips: 14 B + 9 R + 1 G = 24 chips  \n- 24 × 5 = 120 → Total = **140**\n\nNow, you need 2 R chips — at tiles (2,0) and (3,1) — to move along the B-heavy path:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[R] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[B] → (3,3)[G]\n\nYou have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R → **cannot** pay for (2,0) or (3,1) without acquiring R.\n\nI am the only source of R.\n\nCurrently, I plan to use only 5 R chips. I have 14, so I have **9 surplus R**.\n\nIf I give you R chips, I lose them — which reduces my chip total — **hurting my score** — **unless** I receive in return chips that I can keep unused (so they add to final count).\n\nYou can offer B or G.\n\nYou have **14 B**, and I have 14 B already — but I don’t need to use any B. So extra B are just as valuable as extra R — they count toward final score.\n\nTherefore: **I am willing to trade surplus R for surplus B or G, as long as I end up with more total chips after the trade.**\n\nBut note: when I give you R, I lose them. You use them, so they are gone from your inventory too.\n\nBut if you give me B, and you have surplus B, then you can afford to give them up.\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\n- I use 5 R → I can give up to 9 R without risking self-harm (assuming I don't need them).\n- You need only 2 R: at (2,0) and (3,1).\n\nSo I can give you 2 R.\n\nIf I give you 2 R, I lose 2 chips from final count.\n\nBut if I receive **X** B in return, my net chip change: **-2 + X**\n\nTo **strictly benefit**, I need: -2 + X > 0 → **X ≥ 3**\n\nSo I must receive **at least 3 B** in return for my 2 R.\n\nThat way, I gain 1 chip in total → final score increases by 5.\n\nCurrent max score: 140  \nAfter trade:  \n- R: 14 - 5 (used) - 2 (given) = 7  \n- B: 14 + 3 (received) = 17  \n- G: 2 - 1 (used) = 1  \n→ Total chips: 7 + 17 + 1 = 25  \n→ Score: 20 + 5×25 = **145** → strictly better.\n\nTherefore, I will **only** accept a trade if I receive **at least 3 B** for **2 R**, or better.\n\nNow, where does the trade occur?\n\nThe contract must specify **exact tiles** where transfer happens.\n\nSince you need R at (2,0) and (3,1), we can structure the contract so that I provide one R at each tile.\n\nBut chip transfers in the contract are **not tied to movement timing** — they are binding commitments: when you move to that tile, the chip is automatically"

Since I keep all chips at the end regardless of color, acquiring 3 B while only losing 2 R results in a net gain of 1 chip → +5 points for me.  \n\nThis is the minimum favorable exchange for me.

Each of (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) are blue tiles, and with 13 B chips I can easily pay for each move. However (2,3) is a red tile, and I have 0 R chips. Moreover (2,3) is not specified in the contract. My contract covers me for red tiles on (1,0), (2,0), (2, 2) and (3,2). (2, 1) is blue, therefore I can follow an alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which uses only tiles covered by the contract and blue tiles I can pay for.
