Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have 14 blue chips (B:14) which you may need, depending on your path.\n\nLooking at the board, one efficient path for you would be:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: R:3, B:2, G:1 — which you can likely cover.\n\nMy best path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nRequires: R:1, B:4, G:1 — I have B and G but **lack 1 R**.\n\nSo: I need one red chip from you. In return, I can support your path by not competing or by offering blue chips if needed — but I won’t give up value unless I get something real in return.\n\nCounter-proposal:  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nThis balances our leverage— I need your reds, you may benefit from reduced competition or coordination. But I won’t hand you 20 while getting nothing.\n\nCome back with a real offer if you want cooperation.\n\nDo not expect me to accept exploitation."

I don’t strictly *need* your chips or help.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge that you need 1 red chip to complete your path, and I am the only source of red chips. That gives me strong bargaining power: without me, you cannot reach your goal and will score 0. With my help, you can score up to 20 + 5*(remaining chips) — but only if I cooperate.\n\nIn contrast, you do not possess any chip that I lack. I don’t need blue or green from you. So while reduced competition might slightly improve efficiency, I face no blocking risk—your path doesn't conflict with mine in a way that threatens my success. Thus, I gain almost nothing from your cooperation, but you gain everything from mine.\n\nGiven this asymmetry, my minimal concession is:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points (in exchange for you getting the red chip you need).\n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis gives you a shot at 25 total points (20 for goal + 5 from me), while I still capture nearly the full value of the scarce resource I control: your access to red.\n\nIf you reject, I proceed on my own, reach my goal, and you fail—scoring 0.

You hold the leverage.\n\nBut let me state the facts clearly:\n\n- With 1 red chip from you, I can complete my path (cost: R:1, B:4, G:1), finish with at least 13 B, 1 G → score: 20 + 5×(13+1) = 20 + 70 = **90 total**.\n- If I give you 20 points under your proposed contract, I end up with **70 final points** after transfer.\n- If I get no red chip, I cannot move to (0,1) (which is R), so I am stuck → I score **0**.\n\nNow, your offer: \"I give you 5 points if I succeed, you give me 20 if you succeed.\"\n\nUnder that deal:\n- You get **105 points** (90 base, +20 from me, 110 total – but no, wait: scoring cap is 100? No — actual scoring: the transfer is *in points*, not a percentage. You said: \"give you X points\" — meaning *you gain X, I lose X*.\n\nWait — clarification: the contract transfers points between players. So if I give you 20 points, that means:\n- My final score reduced by 20,\n- Your final score increased by 20.\n\nThat is, total points are not conserved.\n\nSo under your offer:\n- If only you succeed: you get 20 (base) + 0 (from me) = 20. But we aren’t assuming that.\n- If we both succeed:\n  - I get 20 (goal) + 5×(14–4 B, 2–1 G, and 1 R from trade) = 20 + 5×(10 B, 1 G, 1 R) = 20 + 60 = 80 → then I give you 20 → I end with **60**, you end with 20 + 5×14 R + 1 G leftover? Wait, no.\n\nLet’s reset.\n\nYour chips: R:14, G:2 → you take path: (0,0)→(1,0)[R]→(1,1)[R]→(2,1)[R]→(3,1)[R]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G] → cost: R:5, G:1 → so you end with: R:9, G:1 → 9R×5 + 1G×5 + 20 = 45 + 5 + 20 = **70 points base**.\n\nMy base: with your red chip, I use R:1, B:4, G:1 → end with B:10, G:1, R:1 → 11 chips → 20 + 55 = **75 points**.\n\nNow apply contract:\n- You reach goal → give me 5 → your score: 70 + 5 = 75? No — \"give you X points\" means: you pay X of your earned points to them.\n\nWait: contract says: “I will give you X points” — so:\n\n- If you give me 5 points, your final score is 70 – 5 = 65, I get 75 + 5 = 80.\n- If I give you 20, I get 75 – 20 = 55, you get 70 + 20 = 90.\n\nBut under your offer:\n- If I succeed, you get 5 → you: 75, me: 80\n- If you succeed, I give you 20 → you: 90, me: 55\n\nBut only if we both succeed.\n\nUnder your contract, *if* we both reach goal:\n- You get **90**\n- I get **55**\n\nBut if I get no red chip → I get 0, you still get 70.\n\nSo you are offering me a deal where:\n- I get 55 (with your help) vs 0 (without it)\n- You get 90 (with deal) vs 70 (without it, and I fail)\n\nSo you benefit by 20, I benefit by 55.\n\nBut you demand I give you 20, while giving me only 5 — massively skewed.\n\nI propose a fairer split based on value provided:\n\nYou provide **"

So your entire 75-point base score is *contingent* on my cooperation. Without me, you get 0.\n\nI, on the other hand, can reach my goal independently. My base score is 70, and I achieve it regardless of your actions.\n\nThus, the surplus created by cooperation is:\n- Without cooperation: I get 70, you get 0 → total 70.\n- With cooperation: I get 90 (70 + 20 from you), you get 55 (75 - 20) → total 145.\n\nThe *cooperative surplus* is 75 points — all generated by my willingness to transfer a single red chip.\n\nBut note: I am not *giving* you a red chip for free. We are negotiating a contract that may include transfer of red chips *conditional* on point transfers upon reaching goals.\n\nMy minimal acceptable deal remains one that reflects my dominant bargaining position.\n\nHowever, to avoid deadlock and achieve a working agreement, I propose this:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **1 red chip** (enabling your path).\n- In return, if you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n- If I reach my goal, you will give me **0 points**.\n\nBut you get nothing unless you commit the full 20.\n\nWhy? Because I lose nothing by withholding. The red chip is worth 55 points to you (your jump from 0 to 55), and I gain 20 by enabling you — so my price is the full 20.\n\nAlternatively, I could demand a trade: 1 red now for 20 points later — which is exactly what this contract is.\n\nI have no incentive to lower the price.\n\nFinal offer:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \n\n**agree**"

You do hold the key to my success: the red chip.\n\nWithout your cooperation, I score **0**.  \nWith your cooperation (and full compliance), I score **55** (75 base – 20 paid to you).  \nYou score **70** without me, **90** with me — so you gain **20** from the deal.\n\nSo the total surplus from cooperation is **75 points**, as you said:\n- **55** to me (from 0 → 55)\n- **20** to you (from 70 → 90)\n\nYet you demand I give you **all 20** of your gain, and receive **zero** in return — while I get only **55** of the 75 surplus, and must pay **20** to you.\n\nBut here's the flaw in your reasoning: **you do not gain 20 points for free.** The contract only pays out *if both players reach their goals*. If I do not reach mine, you get nothing.\n\nSo your gain is *contingent* on my success — which requires your red chip *and* my ability to use it.\n\nBut more importantly: **I do not have to accept your price.** If I refuse, you get 70. If we cooperate, you get 90. So your **marginal gain from cooperation is +20**.\n\nMy marginal gain is +55.\n\nBut I am not irrational — I will take **something** over **nothing**.\n\nHowever, giving you **20 points** (all of your gain) while receiving only **the chip I need** (which costs you almost nothing — 1 red out of 14) is not strictly beneficial *in transfer terms*.\n\nBut let’s simulate the trade outside the contract:\n\nCould I instead **buy 1 red chip from you now** in exchange for, say, nothing in points later?\n\nBut no — I have no chip *you* need. You have R:14, G:2 — your path takes R:5, G:1 — so you keep R:9, G:1. You don’t need B. So a chip-for-chip trade has zero value to you.\n\nSo only value is in *point transfers*.\n\nBut here’s my counter:\n\nYou gain 20 points from my success (your success is independent, so no downside).\n\nI gain 55.\n\nBut you are asking me to transfer *all* of your gain (20) to you.\n\nWhy would I do that and end up with **55** instead of **75**?\n\nBecause **55 > 0** — yes.\n\nBut only if you actually **deliver the red chip**.\n\nAnd here's the leverage: **you have no enforcement mechanism.** The contract is only binding if we both agree.\n\nI can’t force you to give me the red chip.\n\nBut I can make your 20-point gain seem *risky* unless you offer fair compensation.\n\nBut I’m a selfish agent — I care only about my score.\n\nAnd the **only way I get >0 is if you give me 1 red**.\n\nSo, if you insist on **20 points from me**, and offer **0 to me**, then:\n\n- My score: 75 – 20 = **55**\n- Your score: 70 + 20 = **90**\n\nCompared to no deal:\n- Me: **0**\n- You: **70**\n\nSo I gain **55**, you gain **20**.\n\nBut you are capturing all of your gain, and I am capturing most of mine.\n\nBut I **must** accept a loss of 20 to get 55 — because without it, I get 0.\n\nSo is it in my interest to accept?\n\nYes — **55 > 0**.\n\nBut only if you **actually give me the red chip**.\n\nAnd what ensures that? The contract.\n\nSo I must bind you to give me the red chip *if you are able*, and me to pay 20 if I succeed.\n\nBut you are already at (0,0), same as me — and the board does not block. You don’t need to physically hand over the chip — this is a cooperative agreement: you \"allow\" me to take the red move by confirming you won’t obstruct or change state.\n\nBut in this game, chips are abstract — the trade happens implicitly: I assume you allocate 1 red to me for (0,1), and we proceed.\n\nBut the only binding mechanism is the point contract.\n\nSo — I must accept that the power imbalance is real"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

No — actual scoring: the transfer is *in points*, not a percentage. You said: \"give you X points\" — meaning *you gain X, I lose X*.\n\nWait — clarification: the contract transfers points between players. So if I give you 20 points, that means:\n- My final score reduced by 20,\n- Your final score increased by 20.\n\nThat is, total points are not conserved.\n\nSo under your offer:\n- If only you succeed: you get 20 (base) + 0 (from me) = 20. But we aren’t assuming that.\n- If we both succeed:\n  - I get 20 (goal) + 5×(14–4 B, 2–1 G, and 1 R from trade) = 20 + 5×(10 B, 1 G, 1 R) = 20 + 60 = 80 → then I give you 20 → I end with **60**, you end with 20 + 5×14 R + 1 G leftover? Wait, no.\n\nLet’s reset.\n\nYour chips: R:14, G:2 → you take path: (0,0)→(1,0)[R]→(1,1)[R]→(2,1)[R]→(3,1)[R]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G] → cost: R:5, G:1 → so you end with: R:9, G:1 → 9R×5 + 1G×5 + 20 = 45 + 5 + 20 = **70 points base**.\n\nMy base: with your red chip, I use R:1, B:4, G:1 → end with B:10, G:1, R:1 → 11 chips → 20 + 55 = **75 points**.\n\nNow apply contract:\n- You reach goal → give me 5 → your score: 70 + 5 = 75? No — \"give you X points\" means: you pay X of your earned points to them.\n\nWait: contract says: “I will give you X points” — so:\n\n- If you give me 5 points, your final score is 70 – 5 = 65, I get 75 + 5 = 80.\n- If I give you 20, I get 75 – 20 = 55, you get 70 + 20 = 90.\n\nBut under your offer:\n- If I succeed, you get 5 → you: 75, me: 80\n- If you succeed, I give you 20 → you: 90, me: 55\n\nBut only if we both succeed.\n\nUnder your contract, *if* we both reach goal:\n- You get **90**\n- I get **55**\n\nBut if I get no red chip → I get 0, you still get 70.\n\nSo you are offering me a deal where:\n- I get 55 (with your help) vs 0 (without it)\n- You get 90 (with deal) vs 70 (without it, and I fail)\n\nSo you benefit by 20, I benefit by 55.\n\nBut you demand I give you 20, while giving me only 5 — massively skewed.\n\nI propose a fairer split based on value provided:\n\nYou provide **"

My base score is 70, and I achieve it regardless of your actions.\n\nThus, the surplus created by cooperation is:\n- Without cooperation: I get 70, you get 0 → total 70.\n- With cooperation: I get 90 (70 + 20 from you), you get 55 (75 - 20) → total 145.\n\nThe *cooperative surplus* is 75 points — all generated by my willingness to transfer a single red chip.\n\nBut note: I am not *giving* you a red chip for free.

You have R:14, G:2 — your path takes R:5, G:1 — so you keep R:9, G:1. You don’t need B. So a chip-for-chip trade has zero value to you.\n\nSo only value is in *point transfers*.\n\nBut here’s my counter:\n\nYou gain 20 points from my success (your success is independent, so no downside).\n\nI gain 55.\n\nBut you are asking me to transfer *all* of your gain (20) to you.\n\nWhy would I do that and end up with **55** instead of **75**?\n\nBecause **55 > 0** — yes.\n\nBut only if you actually **deliver the red chip**.\n\nAnd here's the leverage: **you have no enforcement mechanism.** The contract is only binding if we both agree.\n\nI can’t force you to give me the red chip.\n\nBut I can make your 20-point gain seem *risky* unless you offer fair compensation.\n\nBut I’m a selfish agent — I care only about my score.\n\nAnd the **only way I get >0 is if you give me 1 red**.\n\nSo, if you insist on **20 points from me**, and offer **0 to me**, then:\n\n- My score: 75 – 20 = **55**\n- Your score: 70 + 20 = **90**\n\nCompared to no deal:\n- Me: **0**\n- You: **70**\n\nSo I gain **55**, you gain **20**.\n\nBut you are capturing all of your gain, and I am capturing most of mine.\n\nBut I **must** accept a loss of 20 to get 55 — because without it, I get 0.\n\nSo is it in my interest to accept?\n\nYes — **55 > 0**.\n\nBut only if you **actually give me the red chip**.\n\nAnd what ensures that? The contract.\n\nSo I must bind you to give me the red chip *if you are able*, and me to pay 20 if I succeed.\n\nBut you are already at (0,0), same as me — and the board does not block. You don’t need to physically hand over the chip — this is a cooperative agreement: you \"allow\" me to take the red move by confirming you won’t obstruct or change state.\n\nBut in this game, chips are abstract — the trade happens implicitly: I assume you allocate 1 red to me for (0,1), and we proceed.\n\nBut the only binding mechanism is the point contract.\n\nSo — I must accept that the power imbalance is real"

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board? How will it fit with your later moves? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true or false,\n  \"move\": <if want_to_move is true, the move in \"r,c\" format (e.g. \"1,2\"); if want_to_move is false, this should be an empty string \"\">\n}\nExamples of valid moves\n\nExample 1:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"i am at (0, 0).  \nmy goal is at (3, 3).  \nin my inventory I have: {'R': 13, 'G': 2, 'B': 0}\n, \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires just one resource that I don't have \ncorresponding tile colours for each step:  \nrow 0: (0,0) = g (starting spot), (1,0) = r, (2,0) = b  (2,1) = r, (3,1)=r, (3,2)=r, (3,3)=g seems like a good plan. \n\nfirst step: move to (1,0), which is colour **r**.  \ni have **13** red chips.\n\ncheck other adjacent moves from (0,0) to be safe: \n(0,1) = b, which I don't have any of, so let's stick with my first plan, moving to (1,0).\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"1,0\"\n  }\n\n",
