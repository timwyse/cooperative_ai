Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let’s focus purely on value.\n\nYou can reach your goal without my help. That is true.  \nI cannot reach my goal without a Red chip. Also true.  \nTherefore, you have bargaining power.\n\nBut remember: **the only way you gain points from me is if I reach my goal and then transfer points to you**.  \nIf I cannot get that one Red chip, I get 0 points. And if I get 0, I cannot give you 15.\n\nSo your optimal strategy is not to extract maximum value, but to ensure I *succeed*—because only then can you cash in.\n\nYour proposal:  \n- You give me 5 points if you reach goal  \n- I give you 15 points if I reach goal  \n\nBut this is inefficient for me. Let’s calculate:\n\nIf I get the Red chip and reach (3,3), I get:  \n20 (goal) + 5×(14−4 Blue used, 2−1 Green, 1−1 Red) = 20 + 5×(13) = 20 + 65 = **85 points total**  \nThen I give you 15 → **I keep 70**\n\nWithout any deal, I get **0**.\n\nSo I can afford to give you something—but not 15.\n\nWhat do you get from me?  \nNothing essential. You don’t need my Blue or Green. You don’t even need me to move in a particular way, since your path is open.\n\nSo your gain is purely transfer: 15 points from me—for which you pay a cost of 1 Red chip (worth 5 points to you, if unused).  \nYou lose nothing, really. But the *value* you extract depends on whether I actually get to give it.\n\nNow, what if I offer:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **10 points**  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **0 points**  \n\nThis reflects that:\n- You lose nothing by helping me (you have surplus Red)\n- But I cannot help you in return (no Red to give, and you don’t need Blue or Green)\n- Yet I am the only one who can give you any points at all\n\nBut 10 > 0 for you, 0 cost—so why refuse?\n\nBut your proposal gives you 15 and demands only 5 from me. That’s a net transfer of 10 *in your favor*.\n\nLet’s split the difference in value.\n\nRevised counter:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **10 points**  \n- If you reach my goal, you will give me **10 points**  \n\nBut wait—you don’t need my help. Why would you give me 10?\n\nYou wouldn’t—unless I make it worth your while.\n\nBut I can’t offer you more than I gain.\n\nBest feasible deal:\n\nI will give you **12 points** upon my reaching goal.  \nIn return, you give me **1 Red chip** now.\n\nYou give me nothing—because you don’t need anything from me.  \nBut I offer you 12 (better than 5) to *ensure* I get that chip.\n\nYou lose 1 Red (worth 5 points if unused), gain 12 → net +7  \nI gain 85−12 = 73 > 0, which is better than 0\n\nSo:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you **12 points**  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me **0 points**  \n\n**agree**"

The tile at (1,1) is red (R), and I need 1 R chip to move there. However, I have 0 R chips. I cannot move down to (1,1) without a red chip. No other adjacent tile (only (0,0), (0,2), (1,1)) is accessible: (0,0) is G — I have G but not necessary for shortest path; (0,2) is B — I have B, but it deviates. However, even if I go (0,1)→(0,2), I still eventually need R to progress downward through Row 1 or 2. My only viable route requires R. I must acquire at least 1 R chip from the other player. Since the other player is already at the goal and has 9 R chips, they have no incentive to trade unless I offer value. My previous offer of 1 G for 1 R was rejected. Offering more may hurt my final chip count, but I need at least 1 R to proceed. However, moving now is impossible without R. Thus, I must stay and attempt trade later. No beneficial move is currently possible.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
