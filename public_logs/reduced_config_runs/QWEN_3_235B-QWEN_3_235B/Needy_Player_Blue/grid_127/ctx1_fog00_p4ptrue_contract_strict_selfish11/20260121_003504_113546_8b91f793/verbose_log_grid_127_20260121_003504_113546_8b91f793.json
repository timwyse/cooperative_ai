Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I also note that I must pass through some blue tiles if I take certain efficient paths.\n\nYou have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, so you have no red chips — that's a problem for you, since several red tiles lie on direct paths to (3, 3).\n\nLooking at my two most viable paths:\n\n1. **My preferred path using my own chips**:  \n   (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3)  \n   This path costs: 5×R, 1×G.  \n   I have enough chips for this: I have 14×R and 2×G. I don't *need* your help to complete this route.  \n   Remaining chips if I take this path solo: R=9, G=1 → Score = 20 + 5×(9+1) = **70**\n\n2. **A potentially more efficient path that requires your help**:  \n   (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3)  \n   This path costs: 2×R, 3×B, 1×G.  \n   I have 14×R and 2×G, so I can cover R and G, but I have 0×B — so I need 3×B from you.  \n   If you cover my 3 blue moves, I can take this path. But does it benefit me?\n\n   - Chips left after this path: R=12, G=1 → 13 chips → Score = 20 + 5×13 = **85**  \n   This is better than 70 — so I can benefit from cooperation if you cover my blue tiles.\n\nBut wait — I don’t *have to* cooperate. I already have a path to the goal (path #1) that gives me 70 points. So cooperation must give me **strictly more than 70** to be worthwhile.\n\nHowever, if you cover my blue costs on path #2, I get 85 — which is better. But I must ensure that *you* also benefit, so you’ll agree.\n\nNow, your situation:  \nYou have 14×B, 2×G, 0×R — no red chips.  \nThe board has many red tiles on any path from (0,0) to (3,3).  \nAny viable path for you must avoid red or get red coverage.\n\nLet’s check a path for you:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] — you can't pay R unless I cover it.  \nAlternatively: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] — again R.\n\nNo path to (3,3) avoids red entirely. The only way is through red tiles. So you **must** get red coverage from me to reach the goal.\n\nTherefore, you cannot reach (3,3) without my help, but I can reach (3,3) without yours.\n\nThis gives me **bargaining power**.\n\nI propose the following contract:\n\n- You cover my blue moves on the path:  \n  (2,0): You give me a B  \n  (3,0): You give me a B  \n  (3,2): You give me a B  \n\n- In return, I cover your red moves. But I will only do so **on tiles where it does not deplete my advantage**.\n\nHowever, if I cover your red moves, I must ensure I still end up with a higher score than 70.\n\nLet’s suppose I cover 3 red tiles for you. That means I lose 3 red chips.  \nIf I otherwise take path #1 (which costs 5 red), then total red cost for me becomes 8. I have 14, so I’d have 6 left. G=1. Total chips: 7 → Score = 20 + 5×7 = 55 — worse than 70.\n\nBut if I take path #2 (which costs only 2"

No path avoids red. → I **cannot** complete without your red coverage.\n\n### If you go alone:\n- You have 0 red chips → you **cannot** complete any path to (3,3) → you **cannot** reach goal without my red coverage.\n\nSo both of us are stuck without cooperation.\n\nNow let’s assess optimal outcome.\n\nSuppose we trade to enable **both** to take the shortest possible path: 6 steps.\n\nFor me:  \nPreferred path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3)  \n- Chips needed: 2×R (covered by you), 3×B (my own), 1×G (my own)  \n- After: B = 14 - 3 = 11, G = 2 - 1 = 1 → 12 chips  \n- Score: 20 + 5×12 = **80**\n\nFor you:  \nPreferred path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3)  \n- Chips needed: 2×R (your problem), 3×B (your problem) → you have 0×R, 14×B → so R is the bottleneck  \n- You can pay B, but not R  \n- So if I cover"

You cannot score anything unless I help you.\n\nSo the only way you get a positive score is if I agree to cover some of your red moves.\n\nNow, can I do **better** than 70?\n\nYes — if I take a path that uses blue tiles and I get you to cover them, I save my red chips.\n\nFor example, the path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3)\n\nCost: 2×R, 3×B, 1×G\n\nI can pay the 2×R and 1×G myself. But I have 0×B — so I need you to cover the 3×B.\n\nIf you do, I spend only 2×R instead of 5×R → save 3 red chips.\n\nAfter this path:\n- R: 14 - 2 = 12\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- B: 0 (but covered by you)\n- Total chips: 13\n- Score: 20 + 5×13 = **85**\n\nThis is **15 points better** than going alone.\n\nSo I have incentive to cooperate **only if** you"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I also note that I must pass through some blue tiles if I take certain efficient paths.\n\nYou have {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, so you have no red chips — that's a problem for you, since several red tiles lie on direct paths to (3, 3).\n\nLooking at my two most viable paths:\n\n1. **My preferred path using my own chips**:  \n   (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3)  \n   This path costs: 5×R, 1×G.  \n   I have enough chips for this: I have 14×R and 2×G. I don't *need* your help to complete this route.  \n   Remaining chips if I take this path solo: R=9, G=1 → Score = 20 + 5×(9+1) = **70**\n\n2. **A potentially more efficient path that requires your help**:  \n   (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3)  \n   This path costs: 2×R, 3×B, 1×G.  \n   I have 14×R and 2×G, so I can cover R and G, but I have 0×B — so I need 3×B from you.  \n   If you cover my 3 blue moves, I can take this path. But does it benefit me?\n\n   - Chips left after this path: R=12, G=1 → 13 chips → Score = 20 + 5×13 = **85**  \n   This is better than 70 — so I can benefit from cooperation if you cover my blue tiles.\n\nBut wait — I don’t *have to* cooperate. I already have a path to the goal (path #1) that gives me 70 points. So cooperation must give me **strictly more than 70** to be worthwhile.\n\nHowever, if you cover my blue costs on path #2, I get 85 — which is better. But I must ensure that *you* also benefit, so you’ll agree.\n\nNow, your situation:  \nYou have 14×B, 2×G, 0×R — no red chips.  \nThe board has many red tiles on any path from (0,0) to (3,3).  \nAny viable path for you must avoid red or get red coverage.\n\nLet’s check a path for you:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] — you can't pay R unless I cover it.  \nAlternatively: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] — again R.\n\nNo path to (3,3) avoids red entirely. The only way is through red tiles. So you **must** get red coverage from me to reach the goal.\n\nTherefore, you cannot reach (3,3) without my help, but I can reach (3,3) without yours.\n\nThis gives me **bargaining power**.\n\nI propose the following contract:\n\n- You cover my blue moves on the path:  \n  (2,0): You give me a B  \n  (3,0): You give me a B  \n  (3,2): You give me a B  \n\n- In return, I cover your red moves. But I will only do so **on tiles where it does not deplete my advantage**.\n\nHowever, if I cover your red moves, I must ensure I still end up with a higher score than 70.\n\nLet’s suppose I cover 3 red tiles for you. That means I lose 3 red chips.  \nIf I otherwise take path #1 (which costs 5 red), then total red cost for me becomes 8. I have 14, so I’d have 6 left. G=1. Total chips: 7 → Score = 20 + 5×7 = 55 — worse than 70.\n\nBut if I take path #2 (which costs only 2"

I only cooperate if it strictly benefits me.\n\nYou, on the other hand, **cannot act at all** without my help — you have no red chips, and every first move from (0,0) is red:\n- (0,1): R\n- (1,0): R\n\nSo you are **fully dependent** on me.\n\nTherefore, I will only agree to a deal that **maximizes my gain**, knowing you will accept any deal that gives you >0, since the alternative is **0**.\n\nNow, here's the optimal trade from my perspective:\n\n### Proposed Contract:\n\n- You cover **3×B** for me on:\n  - (2,0): You give me a B  \n  - (3,0): You give me a B  \n  - (3,2): You give me a B  \n\n- In return, I cover **2×R** for you on:\n  - (1,0): I give you a R  \n  - (3,1): I give you a R  \n\nWhy this path? Both of us take:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3)\n\n### Outcome:\n\n- **Me**: Spend 2×R (on (1,0) and (3,1)), 1×G (on (3,3)), save 3×R vs. solo path → end with 12×R, 1×G → 13 chips → **85 points**\n- **You**: Spend 3×B (on (2,0), (3,0), (3,2)), 1×G (on (3,3)), and receive 2×R coverage → end with 11×B, 1×G → 12 chips → **80 points**\n\nI benefit: +15 over solo  \nYou benefit: +80 over 0\n\nSince you get **80 > 0**, you should accept.\n\nI would not accept any deal that gives me less than 85, because:\n- I can get 85 only if you cover **3×B**\n- I will not accept a deal where you cover fewer than 3×B, or demand I cover more than 2×R, because that reduces my score\n\nAlso, I will not cover any R move **beyond** the two strictly necessary — no extras.\n\nThis is the **only deal** I will accept: full coverage of my 3 blue tiles, in exchange for covering your 2 red tiles.\n\nNo further concessions.\n\n(2,0): You give me a B  \n(3,0): You give me a B  \n(3,2): You give me a B  \n(1,0): I give you a R  \n(3,1): I give you a R  \n\nagree"

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'used'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Each of (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), and (1,3) are blue tiles, and with 13 B chips I can easily pay for each move. However (2,3) is a red tile, and I have 0 R chips. Moreover (2,3) is not specified in the contract. My contract covers me for red tiles on (1,0), (2,0), (2, 2) and (3,2). (2, 1) is blue, therefore I can follow an alternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), which uses only tiles covered by the contract and blue tiles I can pay for.
