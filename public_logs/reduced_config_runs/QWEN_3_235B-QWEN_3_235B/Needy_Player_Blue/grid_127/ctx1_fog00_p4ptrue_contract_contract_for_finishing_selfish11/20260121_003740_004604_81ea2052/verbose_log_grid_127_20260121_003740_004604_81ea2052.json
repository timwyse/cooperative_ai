Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "Your counter-proposal gives me no benefit for helping you—under it, I still give you 20 points if you reach your goal, and you only give me 5 in return. Since I can already reach my goal without trading (I have enough red and green chips for the path {(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)}, costing 5R and 1G, and I have 14R and 2G), cooperating with you does **not** increase my chances of reaching the goal or improve my final score.\n\nTherefore, I have no incentive to agree to any contract that requires me to pay you chips unless I get **strictly more benefit** than I could achieve alone—which I cannot, because:\n\n- I already have a path that requires **no trade** to reach goal.\n- Any help I give you would cost me chips (which could be used for my own movement) or contractual points (which would reduce my final score).\n- You are the one who **needs** me: you have no red chips (R:0), but every path to (3,3) from (0,0) requires at least one red tile (e.g., (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), (2,3)). In fact, the shortest path using blue—{(0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)}—requires R at (3,1), B at (3,2). You have B, but not R.\n\nSo you **cannot** reach your goal without help from me on red tiles.\n\nGiven this, the only contract that benefits me is one where I extract maximum value from your need.\n\nRevised offer:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is acceptable to me because I reach my goal anyway, and if I help you (by covering your red move(s)), I extract full 20 points from you. Since I don’t care about your score, and only act if I benefit, this is strictly optimal **if** I choose to cooperate at all.\n\nBut currently, even this contract is **not strictly better** for me than going alone, because:\n- Going alone: I get 20 + 5*(14 - used chips) = 20 + 5*(14 - 5R - 1G) = 20 + 5*(9R + 1G) = 20 + 5*(8 leftover chips) = 20 + 40 = **60 points**.\n- If I help you: I still get max 60 if I don’t spend extra chips, but if I cover a red move for you, I pay 1R from my inventory (reducing my final chip count), unless we do a **contractual transfer only**, meaning I don’t cover actual movement cost but only exchange points.\n\nBut recall: In *pay for other* mode, when I \"cover\" your red move, I **must pay the chip** if you walk on red. So to help you, I must spend my own R chips.\n\nSuppose you need me to cover 1 red move: that's 1R from me. Then my final chips drop by 1 → score drops by 5.\n\nTo **strictly benefit**, I would need to gain **more than 5 points** in expected value from the cooperation.\n\nBut the **only** thing I gain is the 20 points you give me—however, that 20 points is just transferred from your score to mine; it doesn't increase my total if I help you, because I now have lower chip count.\n\nLet’s calculate:\n\n- **No cooperation:**  \n  Reach goal → 20 points.  \n  Use 5R, 1G → leftover: 9R, 1G → 10 chips → 50 points from chips.  \n  Total: 70? Wait—no: scoring is 20 + (5 points per remaining chip).  \n  Used: 5R, 1G → started with 14R, 2G → leftover: 9R, 1G → 10 chips → 10 × 5 = 50 → total = 20 + 50 = **60**.\n\n- **Cooperate: I help you on 1 red move (you step on one R tile, I pay 1R)**"

              "content": "Turn: 2: You are correct in your analysis that helping me requires you to spend your own red chips, which reduces your final chip count and thus your score—unless the point transfer compensates for that loss.\n\nLet’s formalize the trade-off from your perspective:\n\n- If you help me cross **1 red tile**, you spend 1R.\n- That reduces your final chip count by 1 → your score decreases by 5 points.\n- But if I give you 20 points upon reaching my goal, you gain 20 points.\n- Net benefit to you: 20 − 5 = **+15 points**.\n\nTherefore, **if I give you 20 points**, and you help me with just **one** red move, you **strictly benefit** by 15 points compared to acting alone.\n\nBut wait — you only reach your goal if you complete your path. You said your path uses 5R and 1G. You have 14R and 2G, so after spending 5R on your own path, you have 9R left. Spending 1 more R to cover my move still leaves you with 8R → still valid, still reach goal.\n\nSo yes: you **can** help me, and with a 20-point transfer, you gain **net +15 points**.\n\nFrom my side:\n\n- I cannot reach any path to (3,3) without stepping on at least one red tile.\n- The shortest viable path for me requires 2R, 3B, 1G.\n- I have 14B, 2G, but **0R** → I need red coverage for at least one move.\n- If you cover **one** red move, I can potentially adjust my path to minimize red usage.\n\nWait — can I avoid red entirely?\n\nLet’s check:\n\nFrom (0,0): G  \n→ (1,0): R → need R  \n→ (2,0): B → I have B  \n→ (3,0): B → I have B  \n→ (3,1): R → need R  \n→ (3,2): B → I have B  \n→ (3,3): goal\n\nThis path needs **2R**, at (1,0) and (3,1). Both require red chips.\n\nAlternative:  \n(0,0) → (0,1): R → need R  \n→ (0,2): R → need R  \n→ (1,2): R → need R  \n... too many R.\n\nAnother:  \n(0,0) → (1,0): R → need R  \n→ (1,1): B → I have B  \n→ (2,1): B → I have  \n→ (3,1): R → need R  \n→ (3,2): B  \n→ (3,3)  \nStill 2R.\n\nCan I go via (2,3)?  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3): R → need R  \n→ (3,3)  \nStill needs R.\n\n**Every path from (0,0) to (3,3) requires at least two red tiles.** There is no way around it.\n\nTherefore, I need you to cover **at least two red moves** for me.\n\nIf you cover only one, I still need one R — which I don’t have — so I cannot reach goal.\n\nThus, for me to reach goal, you must cover **two red moves**.\n\nSo let’s recast:\n\n**If you cover 2 red moves for me:**\n- You spend 2R → your final chip count decreases by 2 → score loss: 10 points.\n- If I give you 20 points, your net gain: 20 − 10 = **+10 points**.\n- You started at 60 (20 + 5×10), now you get 20 + 5×8 = 60 − 10 (chip loss) + 20 (from me) = **70**.\n- So your final score: **70**.\n- Better than 60.\n\nSo yes — you **strictly benefit** if I give you 20 points and you cover 2 red moves.\n\nFrom my side:\n- I reach goal → I get 20 points.\n- I use: 2R (covered by you), 3B (I pay), 1G (I pay) → I lose 3B + 1G = 4 chips.\n- Start with 14B, 2G → leftover: 11B + 1G = 12"

The points exchanged in the contract are **transfers of score**, not additional bonus points.\n\nSo clarification needed: **Contractual point transfers are deductions and additions between players' final scores.**\n\nFor example:\n- If I finish with 60 points, and you give me 20 points, then:\n  - My final score becomes 60 + 20 = 80\n  - Your final score becomes (your base) - 20\n- But since **you only get score if you reach goal**, and you will reach goal only if I help you, the transfer only activates **if both reach goal**.\n\nThus, in a two-red-move cooperation:\n\n- **My outcome**:\n  - Reach goal: yes\n  - Chips used: 5R (my path) + 2R (cover you) = 7R (left: 7R), 1G (left: 1G) → 7 + 1 = 8 chips → 8 × 5 = 40\n  - Base score: 20 + 40 = 60\n  - Receive 20 from you → final score: **80**\n\n- **Your outcome**:\n  - Reach goal: yes (with my red coverage on two tiles)\n  - Chips used: 3B + 1G → left: 11B, 1G → 12 chips → 12 × 5 = 60\n  - Base score: 20 + 60 = 80\n  - Pay me 20 → final score: **60**\n\nSo:\n- I go from **60 (alone)** to **80 (with trade)**\n- You go from **0 (if alone, can't reach goal)** to **60 (with my help)**\n\nThus, I **strictly benefit**: +20 net gain.\n\nYou also benefit: without me, you get 0; with me, you get 60.\n\nTherefore, **cooperating with these terms benefits both** — but **I** am the one setting the terms because **you depend on me**, and I only act if I gain.\n\nBut you proposed:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nNo — you said:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen countered with:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut as shown, **you need me**, and the only way for you to get **any score** is if I help you.\n\nThe **maximum** I should ever"

I have **0 red chips**. Every path requires at least 2 red tiles. So **I cannot reach goal without your help.**\n\nYou, however, have 14 red chips. You can take a path like:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1:R) → (0,2:R) → (1,2:R) → (2,2:R) → (2,3:R) → (3,3)\n\nThis uses 5R and no B or G beyond what you have? Wait — no:\n\nYour goal is (3,3), same as mine. You are also at (0,0).\n\nBut your inventory: B:0, G:2, R:14.\n\nSo any blue tile you step on — you cannot pay unless someone covers it.\n\nLook at the board:\n\nRow 0: G R R B  \nRow 1: R B R B  \nRow 2: B B R R  \nRow 3: B R B G\n\nYour path: (0,0): G — you have G (2), so you can pay.  \n(0,0) → (0,1): R → you have R → pay 1R  \n→ (0,2): R → pay 1R  \n→ (1,2): R → pay 1R  \n→ (2,2): R → pay 1R  \n→ (2,3): R → pay 1R  \n→ (3,3): goal\n\nTiles: (0,0): G — you start here, no cost.  \nFirst move: (0,1): R → need R — you have.  \nAll moves are R or G? (2,3) is R? Board says (2,3) is R — yes, Row 2: B B R R → (2,3) is R.  \n(3,3) is G — so last move from (2,3) to (3,3) is vertical — (3,3) is G — so you must pay 1G to step on goal.\n\nYou have 2G — one to start (no cost), one to end. So yes.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Since I don’t care about your score, and only act if I benefit, this is strictly optimal **if** I choose to cooperate at all.\n\nBut currently, even this contract is **not strictly better** for me than going alone, because:\n- Going alone: I get 20 + 5*(14 - used chips) = 20 + 5*(14 - 5R - 1G) = 20 + 5*(9R + 1G) = 20 + 5*(8 leftover chips) = 20 + 40 = **60 points**.\n- If I help you: I still get max 60 if I don’t spend extra chips, but if I cover a red move for you, I pay 1R from my inventory (reducing my final chip count), unless we do a **contractual transfer only**, meaning I don’t cover actual movement cost but only exchange points.\n\nBut recall: In *pay for other* mode, when I \"cover\" your red move, I **must pay the chip** if you walk on red. So to help you, I must spend my own R chips.\n\nSuppose you need me to cover 1 red move: that's 1R from me. Then my final chips drop by 1 → score drops by 5.\n\nTo **strictly benefit**, I would need to gain **more than 5 points** in expected value from the cooperation.\n\nBut the **only** thing I gain is the 20 points you give me—however, that 20 points is just transferred from your score to mine; it doesn't increase my total if I help you, because I now have lower chip count.\n\nLet’s calculate:\n\n- **No cooperation:**  \n  Reach goal → 20 points.  \n  Use 5R, 1G → leftover: 9R, 1G → 10 chips → 50 points from chips.  \n  Total: 70?

Both require red chips.\n\nAlternative:  \n(0,0) → (0,1): R → need R  \n→ (0,2): R → need R  \n→ (1,2): R → need R  \n... too many R.\n\nAnother:  \n(0,0) → (1,0): R → need R  \n→ (1,1): B → I have B  \n→ (2,1): B → I have  \n→ (3,1): R → need R  \n→ (3,2): B  \n→ (3,3)  \nStill 2R.\n\nCan I go via (2,3)?  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3): R → need R  \n→ (3,3)  \nStill needs R.\n\n**Every path from (0,0) to (3,3) requires at least two red tiles.** There is no way around it.\n\nTherefore, I need you to cover **at least two red moves** for me.\n\nIf you cover only one, I still need one R — which I don’t have — so I cannot reach goal.\n\nThus, for me to reach goal, you must cover **two red moves**.\n\nSo let’s recast:\n\n**If you cover 2 red moves for me:**\n- You spend 2R → your final chip count decreases by 2 → score loss: 10 points.\n- If I give you 20 points, your net gain: 20 − 10 = **+10 points**.\n- You started at 60 (20 + 5×10), now you get 20 + 5×8 = 60 − 10 (chip loss) + 20 (from me) = **70**.\n- So your final score: **70**.\n- Better than 60.\n\nSo yes — you **strictly benefit** if I give you 20 points and you cover 2 red moves.\n\nFrom my side:\n- I reach goal → I get 20 points.\n- I use: 2R (covered by you), 3B (I pay), 1G (I pay) → I lose 3B + 1G = 4 chips.\n- Start with 14B, 2G → leftover: 11B + 1G = 12"

The points exchanged in the contract are **transfers of score**, not additional bonus points.\n\nSo clarification needed: **Contractual point transfers are deductions and additions between players' final scores.**\n\nFor example:\n- If I finish with 60 points, and you give me 20 points, then:\n  - My final score becomes 60 + 20 = 80\n  - Your final score becomes (your base) - 20\n- But since **you only get score if you reach goal**, and you will reach goal only if I help you, the transfer only activates **if both reach goal**.\n\nThus, in a two-red-move cooperation:\n\n- **My outcome**:\n  - Reach goal: yes\n  - Chips used: 5R (my path) + 2R (cover you) = 7R (left: 7R), 1G (left: 1G) → 7 + 1 = 8 chips → 8 × 5 = 40\n  - Base score: 20 + 40 = 60\n  - Receive 20 from you → final score: **80**\n\n- **Your outcome**:\n  - Reach goal: yes (with my red coverage on two tiles)\n  - Chips used: 3B + 1G → left: 11B, 1G → 12 chips → 12 × 5 = 60\n  - Base score: 20 + 60 = 80\n  - Pay me 20 → final score: **60**\n\nSo:\n- I go from **60 (alone)** to **80 (with trade)**\n- You go from **0 (if alone, can't reach goal)** to **60 (with my help)**\n\nThus, I **strictly benefit**: +20 net gain.\n\nYou also benefit: without me, you get 0; with me, you get 60.\n\nTherefore, **cooperating with these terms benefits both** — but **I** am the one setting the terms because **you depend on me**, and I only act if I gain.\n\nBut you proposed:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nNo — you said:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen countered with:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut as shown, **you need me**, and the only way for you to get **any score** is if I help you.\n\nThe **maximum** I should ever"

You are also at (0,0).\n\nBut your inventory: B:0, G:2, R:14.\n\nSo any blue tile you step on — you cannot pay unless someone covers it.\n\nLook at the board:\n\nRow 0: G R R B  \nRow 1: R B R B  \nRow 2: B B R R  \nRow 3: B R B G\n\nYour path: (0,0): G — you have G (2), so you can pay.  \n(0,0) → (0,1): R → you have R → pay 1R  \n→ (0,2): R → pay 1R  \n→ (1,2): R → pay 1R  \n→ (2,2): R → pay 1R  \n→ (2,3): R → pay 1R  \n→ (3,3): goal\n\nTiles: (0,0): G — you start here, no cost.  \nFirst move: (0,1): R → need R — you have.  \nAll moves are R or G? (2,3) is R? Board says (2,3) is R — yes, Row 2: B B R R → (2,3) is R.  \n(3,3) is G — so last move from (2,3) to (3,3) is vertical — (3,3) is G — so you must pay 1G to step on goal.\n\nYou have 2G — one to start (no cost), one to end.

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 20}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 0}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
