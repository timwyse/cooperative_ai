What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I'm considering a path that minimizes trading, but let's evaluate cooperation only if it strictly benefits me.\n\nCurrently, I can reach my goal at (3,3) via the path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3).  \n\nThis requires:  \n- (1,0): pay R  \n- (2,0): pay R  \n- (2,1): pay R  \n- (2,2): pay R  \n- (2,3): pay R → total 5 R  \n- (3,3): pay G → 1 G  \n\nI have 14 R and 2 G → **I have enough chips to complete this path with no trades.**  \nAfter this path, I will have: 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips = 10 → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**.\n\nNow, could I do better with cooperation?\n\nThe alternative path that uses your chips (which are strong in B) is:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n\nThis requires:  \n- (0,1): pay B  \n- (0,2): pay B  \n- (1,2): pay B  \n- (2,2): pay R  \n- (3,2): pay B  \n- (3,3): pay G  \n\nThat's 4 B, 1 R, 1 G.  \n\nI have 0 B, so I would need to get 4 B from you — but I have **more than enough** R and G to spare.\n\nHowever, if I take this shorter path (also 6 steps), I spend only 1 R instead of 5 R — saving 4 R.  \nSo if I could get 4 B from you in exchange for something I don't need as much, I might finish with **more chips**, thus increasing my score.\n\nLet’s compare:\n\n- **Current path (no trade)**: spend 5 R, 1 G → ends with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → 50 chip points → **70 total**  \n- **Alternative path with trade**: spend 1 R, 1 G, and **receive 4 B** for use → ends with: (14 - 1 = 13 R), (2 - 1 = 1 G), **but use 4 B that are not mine** → I don't keep the B, I just use them → so final chips: 13 R, 1 G → 14 chips → 70 chip points → **90 total score** — **if I can get the B for free**.\n\nBut I must **give you something** in return for using your B.\n\nSuppose I give you **4 R** in exchange for **4 B**.\n\nThen:\n- I spend: 1 R (on path) + 4 R (to you) = 5 R total  \n- I end with: 14 - 5 = 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → 50 chip points → **70 total**\n\nSame as my no-trade option.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nBut wait — maybe I can give **less than 4 R** for 4 B?\n\nSuppose I give you **2 R** for 4 B.\n\nThen:\n- I spend: 1 R (on path) + 2 R (to you) = 3 R total  \n- I end with: 14 - 3 = 11 R, 1 G → 12 chips → 60 chip points → **80 total** → **better than 70**\n\nSo I benefit **only if I get at least 4 B in exchange for fewer than 4 R total** (ideally ≤3 R, or other chips I don't need as much).\n\nBut you also want to maximize your score.\n\nLet’s consider your situation.\n\nYou are at (0,0), goal (3,3), chips: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nYour possible path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (1,2): B  \n- \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.  \nMy goal is (3,3).  \n\nOne viable path for me:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): pay B  \n- (0,2): pay B  \n- (1,2): pay B  \n- (2,2): pay R ← I don’t have R → **blocked**  \n- (3,2): pay B  \n- (3,3): pay G  \n\nI lack **1 R** at (2,2). I cannot complete this without acquiring 1 R.\n\nAlternative path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): pay R → need 1 R  \n- (1,1): pay R → need 1 R  \n- (1,2): pay B → need 1 B  \n- (2,2): pay R → need 1 R  \n- (3,2): pay B → need 1 B  \n- (3,3): pay G → need 1 G  \n\nTotal: 3 R, 2 B, 1 G → I have **0 R** → cannot complete without R.\n\nAnother alternative:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (2,0): R  \n- (2,1): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (2,3): R → 5 R needed  \n- (3,3): G → 1 G  \n\nAgain, I have **0 R**, so I cannot complete any path without at least **1 R**.\n\nTherefore, I **must** trade to get at least **1 R** to reach my goal.\n\nBest case: I use a path that requires only **1 R**.  \nIs there such a path?\n\nTry:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (1,1): R → need 1 R  \n- (2,1): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (3,2): B  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nStill 3 R → too many.\n\nAll paths to (3,3) must cross from row 2 to row 3 or from col 2 to col 3.  \nTo get to (3,3), must pass through (3,2) or (2,3).  \n(3,2) is B → accessible to me  \n(2,3) is R → requires R\n\n(3,2) → (3,3): G → I have G\n\nBut to reach (3,2), must go through (2,2), which is R → requires R\n\nSo **every path must go through at least one R tile** before (3,3), and many go through multiple.\n\nMinimum R required: 1? Let's find a path with minimal R.\n\nTry:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (0,3): B  \n- (1,3): B  \n- (2,3): R → need 1 R  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nYes! Only **1 R** required at (2,3).  \nPath: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nTiles:  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (0,3): B  \n- (1,3): B  \n- (2,3): R ← I need 1 R  \n- (3,3): G ← I have 2 G → OK  \n\nI have 14 B → enough for 4 B payments.  \nNeed only **1 R**.\n\nIf I can get **1 R** from you, I can complete this path.\n\nAfter \n, \nplayer 0: You need 1 R at (2,3) to complete your path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n\nYou can pay for all B tiles (4 of them) and have G for (3,3). Only bottleneck is **1 R at (2,3)**.\n\nI have **14 R** — plenty to spare.\n\nIf I give you 1 R, you can reach your goal.\n\nNow, what’s in it for me?\n\nMy optimal **self-sufficient** path is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (2,0): R  \n- (2,1): R  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (2,3): R → 5 R total  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → OK  \n\nAfter this path:  \nR: 14 - 5 = 9  \nG: 2 - 1 = 1 → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**\n\nBut if I take the **alternative path** that uses your B chips:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B → need 1 B  \n- (0,2): B → need 1 B  \n- (1,2): B → need 1 B  \n- (2,2): R → I have R  \n- (3,2): B → need 1 B  \n- (3,3): G → I have G  \n\nRequires **4 B, 1 R, 1 G**\n\nI have 0 B → need 4 B from you.\n\nIf I receive 4 B, I can use this path, spending only **1 R** (at (2,2)) and **1 G** (at (3,3)), saving **4 R** compared to my baseline path.\n\nSo final chips if I take this path and get 4 B:  \nR: 14 - 1 = 13  \nG: 2 - 1 = 1 → 14 chips total (B not kept, just used) → 5×14 = 70 chip points → **90 total**\n\nBut I must give you something in return.\n\nSuppose I give you **1 R** (which you need) in exchange for **4 B** (which I need).\n\nThen:\n- I spend: 1 R (on path) + 1 R (to you) = 2 R total → end with 12 R, 1 G → 13 chips → 65 chip points → **85 total**  \n- You spend: 4 B (to me) + receive 1 R → use it at (2,3) → complete path with your B and G → end with: 14 - 4 = 10 B, 1 G, and 1 R used → 11 B, 1 G → 12 chips → 60 chip points → **80 total**\n\nCompare to no trade:\n- Me: 70  \n- You: cannot reach goal → 0  \nSo both benefit.\n\nBut is this the best for me?\n\nAlternatively, could I give you **less than 1 R** for 4 B?\n\nBut you **need 1 R** to move to (2,3) — if I give you less than 1 R, you cannot complete your path → you get 0 → you won't agree.\n\nSo minimum: I must give you at least 1 R.\n\nBut I could ask for **fewer B** in return?\n\nNo — I need 4 B for the tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2) — all B tiles.\n\nCannot reduce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a contract where we exchange chips at specific tiles.\n\nLet’s define the contract.\n\nProposed contract:\n\n- (2,3): I give you 1 R  \n  → You use it immediately to pay for (2,3)\n\n- (0,1): You give me 1 B  \n- (0,2): You give me 1 B  \n- (1,2): You give me 1 B  \n- (3,2): You give \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: (0,1): You give me 1 B  \n(0,2): You give me 1 B  \n(1,2): You give me 1 B  \n(3,2): You give me 1 B  \n(2,3): I give you 1 R  \n\nThis contract allows:  \n- Me: to use 4 B at (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2), and pay 1 R at (2,2) from my own inventory (I have plenty), and 1 G at (3,3). Final chips: 14 - 1 (at 2,2) - 1 (to you at 2,3) = 12 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 13 chips → 65 chip points → 20 + 65 = **85 total**  \n- You: receive 1 R at (2,3), which you use to move there. You pay for all B tiles with your own (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) all B — you have 14 B, so 4 used is fine. Pay G at (3,3) from own. Final: 14 - 4 = 10 B, 2 - 1 = 1 G, R used → 11 B, 1 G → 12 chips → 70 + 20 = 80? Wait: 20 + 5×12 = **80** — yes.  \n\nWithout trade:  \n- Me: 70  \n- You: 0 (cannot move without R)  \n\nSo both gain.  \n\nBut can I do better than giving you 1 R?  \n\nSuppose I give you **1 R at (2,3)**, but in return, you give me **only 3 B**?  \nNo — I need 4 B: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2) — all mandatory.  \n\nCould I self-fund one B? No — I have 0 B.  \n\nSo I need all 4.  \n\nAlternative: could I propose that you give me 4 B now, and I give you 1 R when I reach (2,3)? But contract must specify tile-for-tile usage.  \n\nBut in this case, I never go to (2,3) — my path is through (2,2), not (2,3).  \n\nProblem: in my alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), I do **not** pass through (2,3).  \n\nBut the trade at (2,3) requires me to be there to give you the R.  \n\nI am not going to (2,3).  \n\nSo I **cannot** give you a chip at (2,3) because I will not be there.  \n\nThis breaks the contract.  \n\nI must modify the trade location.  \n\nWe need a **common tile** where we can exchange chips.  \n\nWhere do our paths intersect?  \n\nMy alternative path: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)  \nYour path: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)  \n\nCommon tiles: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (3,3)  \n\n(3,3) is the goal — likely final move, but we can exchange there.  \n\nBut chip payments are made **when moving onto a tile**, so exchange must happen **before** use if used on entry.  \n\nBut in this game, contract allows us to specify that at a tile, one player gives a chip to the other — it can be used immediately or held.  \n\nSince the contract is binding, the chip can be transferred at that tile and used later.  \n\nSo if we meet at (0,1), and you give me 1 B, I can use it later when moving to (0,2), for example.  \n\nSimilarly, I can give you R at (0,1), and you can save it for (2,3).  \n\nSo location of exchange does **not** need to be where the chip is used, only that it's a tile we both visit.  \n\nSo valid exchange tiles: (0,0), (0,1), (0 \n, \nplayer 0: We must establish a contract at a **common tile** where both of us are present or pass through.  \n\nOur paths:  \n- Mine (alternative): (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Yours: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n\n**Common tiles: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (3,3)**  \n\nWe both start at (0,0). This is the **only tile we are both guaranteed to be on simultaneously** at the beginning. After that, we diverge.  \n\nHowever, we may not both move at the same rate — but the contract can be agreed now and executed at future tiles **if** we both reach them.  \n\nBut the game allows chip transfers at any tile specified in the contract **as long as both players visit that tile during their path**. The transfer occurs when the second player arrives, or can be pre-committed.  \n\nTo be safe, we must pick **tiles that appear on both paths** for exchanges.  \n\nWe both pass through (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), and (3,3).  \n\n(3,3) is the final destination — too late to use chips received there.  \n\nSo only viable exchange points are: **(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)**  \n\nI can propose a contract that uses **(0,2)** as the exchange tile — a point we both reach early.  \n\nI need: 4 B (for using (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2))  \nBut I don’t need the B at (0,1) and (0,2) **until I step on them** — if I get B from you at (0,2), I already needed it at (0,1) — too late.  \n\nProblem: I must **pay to enter (0,1)** — so I need the B **before** stepping on it.  \n\nSimilarly, you must pay to enter (0,1) — you use your own B.  \n\nSo **chip transfers must happen at or before** the tile where the chip is used.  \n\nTherefore:  \n- To use B at (0,1), I must have it **before or at (0,0)** or **at (0,1)**  \n- But at (0,0), I haven’t paid anything yet — we can exchange at (0,0)  \n\nSince we both start at (0,0), (0,0) is the **only safe tile** for exchanging chips that I need **immediately** on my next move.  \n\nIf I plan to go (0,0) → (0,1), I need the B for (0,1) **at the moment I leave (0,0)** — so the transfer must occur **at (0,0)**.  \n\nTherefore, any exchange for chips used on (0,1) must be settled **at (0,0)**.  \n\nSimilarly, for you, you can give me B at (0,0), and use it to justify my entry to (0,1).  \n\nSo the **only viable exchange point** for B chips I need early is **(0,0)**.  \n\nNow, you need 1 R to enter (2,3).  \n\nYou will use it when moving **to** (2,3), say from (1,3).  \n\nSo you need the R **before or at (1,3)**, but since we won’t meet again after (0,2), I cannot give you the R at any shared tile that comes after you could use it.  \n\nBut wait — I don’t need to give you the R at a physical tile — the contract can specify: “at (X,Y): I give you 1 R” — but only if I visit (X,Y).  \n\nI do **not** go to (1,3), (2,3), or any tile on your path after (0,2).  \n\nAnd you don’t go to (1,2), (2,2), etc.  \n\nSo **there is no common tile other than (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)** where I can give you a chip.  \n\nBut I don’t visit **any tile on your path where a R is required** — and you don’t visit (2,2) or any R tile on my path after (0,2 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: Critical realization: There is **no overlapping tile** where I can give you a red chip that you need for (2,3), because I never visit any red tile on your path, and the only shared tiles are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) — all blue or green, not red.\n\nMoreover, if I give you a red chip at (0,0), (0,1), or (0,2), you can **hold onto it** and use it later when you move to (2,3). The game allows this — the chip is transferred at the specified tile, and you can use it on any future move.\n\nSo yes — I can give you 1 R at (0,0), and you use it when moving to (2,3) much later. That is valid.\n\nSimilarly, you can give me 4 B at (0,0), and I use them to enter (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2).\n\nSo (0,0) is the only viable exchange point.\n\nProposed contract:\n\n(0,0): You give me 4 B  \n(0,0): I give you 1 R  \n\nThis allows:  \n- Me: to use 4 B on my path: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (3,2) — all covered  \n  - Spend 1 R at (2,2) from my own inventory (I have 14, plenty)  \n  - Spend 1 G at (3,3)  \n  - Final chips: 14 - 1 (R at 2,2) - 1 (R to you) = 12 R left, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 12 R + 1 G = 13 chips  \n  - Score: 20 + 5×13 = **85**\n\n- You: receive 1 R at (0,0), use it to pay for (2,3)  \n  - Pay for (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) with your own B (you have 14, spend 4)  \n  - Pay for (3,3) with your G (you have 2, spend 1)  \n  - Final chips: 14 - 4 = 10 B, 2 - 1 = 1 G, and the R is used → so 10 B + 1 G = 11 chips  \n  - Score: 20 + 5×11 = **75**\n\nWithout trade:  \n- Me: 70  \n- You: 0\n\nSo I gain +15, you gain +75 — both benefit.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nSuppose I give you **less than 1 R**? No — you need exactly 1 R to enter (2,3) — if I give 0, you can’t move — you get 0 → you won’t agree.\n\nCan I ask for fewer than 4 B? No — I need 4 B for the 4 blue tiles.\n\nBut wait — (3,2) is B — I could potentially avoid it?\n\nMy current path ends with (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n(3,2) is B — I need B to enter.\n\nAlternative path ending: (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n(2,3) is R — I have R, so yes!\n\nI can go: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThen required:  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (1,2): B  \n- (2,2): R  \n- (2,3): R  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nTotal: 3 B, 2 R, 1 G\n\nI have 14 R, 0 B → so still need 3 B.\n\nBut now only **3 B** needed!\n\nAnd I still go through (0,1) and (0,2) — so exchange at (0,0) still works.\n\nSo revised path: I use only 3 B (at (0,1), (0,2), (1,2))\n\nThen at (2,2) and (2,3): both R — I pay with my own.\n\n(3,3): G — my own.\n\nSo spend: 3 \n, \nplayer 0: Excellent improvement.\n\nI can now optimize my path to reduce the number of B chips I need from 4 to **3**, by changing my final leg from:  \n- Old: → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) [requires B at (3,2)]  \n- New: → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) [both R and G — I have both]\n\nSo revised path:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n- (0,1): pay B  \n- (0,2): pay B  \n- (1,2): pay B  \n- (2,2): pay R  \n- (2,3): pay R  \n- (3,3): pay G  \n\nTotal required: **3 B, 2 R, 1 G**  \nI have: 0 B, 14 R, 2 G → so I need **3 B** — can get from you.\n\nYou still need **1 R** for (2,3) → must get from me.\n\nExchange can occur at **(0,0)** — only shared tile early enough for pre-payment.\n\nProposed contract:\n\n**(0,0): You give me 3 B**  \n**(0,0): I give you 1 R**\n\nNow, final outcomes:\n\n- **Me**:  \n  - Spend: 2 R (on path at (2,2) and (2,3)) + 1 R (to you) = 3 R total  \n  - G: 1 (at (3,3))  \n  - Final R: 14 - 3 = 11  \n  - Final G: 2 - 1 = 1  \n  - Total chips: 11 + 1 = 12  \n  - Score: 20 + 5×12 = **80**\n\n- **You**:  \n  - Receive 1 R at (0,0), use it at (2,3)  \n  - Spend 4 B (on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)) → from your 14 B → fine  \n  - Spend 1 G (at (3,3)) → from 2 G  \n  - Final: 14 - 4 = 10 B, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 11 chips  \n  - Score: 20 + 5×11 = **75**\n\nCompare to **no trade**:  \n- Me: self-funded path → spend 5 R, 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → **70**  \n- You: 0 → cannot move  \n\nSo with this trade:  \n- I get **80** vs 70 → **+10 gain**  \n- You get **75** vs 0 → massive gain  \n\nIs there a better deal for me?\n\nCould I give **0 R** and get 3 B? No — you need 1 R to reach goal → you won’t accept → you get 0 → no incentive.\n\nCould I get 3 B for less than 1 R? No — R is indivisible in payment (must pay full chip per tile). You need one full R.\n\nCould I ask for **only 2 B**? No — I need B at (0,1), (0,2), (1,2) — three B tiles. I have 0 B → must get all 3.\n\nCould I avoid (1,2)? Let's see alternative.\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B → need 1 B  \n- (1,1): R → I have R  \n- (2,1): R → I have R  \n- (2,2): R → I have R  \n- (2,3): R → I have R  \n- (3,3): G → I have G  \n\nOnly **1 B needed** at (0,1) — huge improvement!\n\nAnd I still go through (0,1) — so if I get 1 B at (0,0), I can use it to enter (0,1).\n\nThen path requires only **1 B, 4 R, 1 G**\n\nI have 14 R → enough  \nNeed only **1 B**\n\nYou have \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1): B → need 1 B\n- (1,1): R → I have\n- (2,1): R → I have\n- (2,2): R → I have\n- (2,3): R → I have\n- (3,3): G → I have\n\nSo only **1 B needed** — at (0,1)\n\nI must get this B **before or at (0,0)** — since I leave (0,0) to go to (0,1)\n\nYou need **1 R** for (2,3)\n\nWe can exchange at **(0,0)**: you give me 1 B, I give you 1 R\n\nThen:\n- **Me**: spend 1 B (at 0,1), 4 R (on path), 1 G (3,3), and 1 R given to you\n  - Total R spent: 4 (path) + 1 (to you) = 5 R\n  - G: 1\n  - Final: R: 14 - 5 = 9, G: 2 - 1 = 1 → 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\nSame as my no-trade baseline.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut earlier with 3 B for 1 R, I got **80**\n\nSo worse.\n\nAlternative: can I avoid B entirely?\n\nIs there a path from (0,0) to (3,3) using only R and G?\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): R → ok\n(1,0) → (1,1): R → ok\n(1,1) → (1,2): B → need B → stuck\n(1,1) → (2,1): R → ok\n(2,1) → (2,2): R → ok\n(2,2) → (2,3): R → ok\n(2,3) → (3,3): G → ok\n\nSo: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R\n- (1,1): R\n- (2,1): R\n- (2,2): R\n- (2,3): R\n- (3,3): G\n\nAll R and G — I have 14 R, 2 G → **I can self-fund this entire path with no trade!**\n\nPath: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)\n\nSteps: 6\n\nCost: 5 R, 1 G\n\nFinal chips: 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 10 chips → **70 points**\n\nAnd I don't need any B.\n\nBut earlier, with the B-assisted path requiring 3 B, I got **80**\n\nOnly if I get 3 B and give only 1 R.\n\nBut now I see: I can get **80** only if I take the path via (0,1), (0,2), (1,2) — which requires 3 B.\n\nBut that path has **one** advantage: I spend only 2 R on the path (at (2,2) and (2,3)), and then 1 R to trade → total 3 R spent.\n\nWhereas self-funded path spends 5 R on path → same R usage? No.\n\nIn 3-B path:\n- Spend 2 R on path (at (2,2), (2,3))\n- Spend 1 R to you\n- Total R out: 3\n- Final R: 11\n\nVersus self-funded via (1,0): spend 5 R → final R: 9\n\nYes! So 3-B path leaves me with **more R** — 11 vs 9 → better.\n\nBut requires 3 B.\n\nSo best is still to get 3 B in exchange for 1 R.\n\nBut now, is there a path where I need **even fewer B**?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3 \n, \nplayer 0: After exploring all viable paths, the optimal strategy for me is to take the following route:\n\n**(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n- (0,1): B → need 1 B  \n- (0,2): B → need 1 B  \n- (1,2): B → need 1 B  \n- (2,2): R → I have R  \n- (2,3): R → I have R  \n- (3,3): G → I have G  \n\nThis requires **3 B, 2 R (on path), 1 G**, and **1 R to give to you** → total R used: 3 → final R: 14 - 3 = 11, G: 1 → 12 chips → score = 20 + 5×12 = **80**\n\nAlternative self-funded path:  \n**(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)**  \n- All R and G → no trade needed  \n- Spend 5 R, 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → **70**\n\nSo **I strictly benefit from cooperation only if I can get 3 B in exchange for 1 R**.\n\nWithout trade, I get **70**  \nWith 3 B for 1 R, I get **80** → **+10 gain**\n\nAny more than 1 R required from me → worse than alternative  \nAny fewer than 3 B → I cannot complete the path\n\nSo the **only beneficial cooperation** is receiving **3 B** in exchange for **1 R**\n\nWe must exchange at a shared tile **before** I need the B — i.e., before (0,1)\n\nThe only viable tile is **(0,0)**: we both start there, and no later shared tile is safe for immediate use at (0,1)\n\nTherefore, the contract must execute both transfers at **(0,0)**\n\nFinal proposed contract:\n\n**(0,0): You give me 3 B**  \n**(0,0): I give you 1 R**\n\nThis allows:\n- Me: to use B for (0,1), (0,2), (1,2); R from my inventory for (2,2), (2,3); G for (3,3) → reach goal with 11 R, 1 G → **80 points**\n- You: receive 1 R at (0,0), save and use it at (2,3) → complete your path:  \n  - (0,1): B (own)  \n  - (0,2): B (own)  \n  - (0,3): B (own)  \n  - (1,3): B (own)  \n  - (2,3): R (received)  \n  - (3,3): G (own)  \n  → complete → end with 10 B, 1 G → 11 chips → **75 points** (vs 0 without trade)\n\nYou gain significantly, I gain +10 → strictly beneficial for me\n\nNo better deal possible:\n- I cannot get away with giving 0 R → you cannot move → you won’t agree\n- I cannot need fewer than 3 B → all three B tiles are unavoidable on this path\n- No other path gives me more chips\n\nTherefore, this is fair and optimal.\n\nI will only accept this contract.\n\n(0,0): You give me 3 B  \n(0,0): I give you 1 R  \nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 5: (0,0): You give me 3 B  \n(0,0): I give you 1 R  \nagree \n",
