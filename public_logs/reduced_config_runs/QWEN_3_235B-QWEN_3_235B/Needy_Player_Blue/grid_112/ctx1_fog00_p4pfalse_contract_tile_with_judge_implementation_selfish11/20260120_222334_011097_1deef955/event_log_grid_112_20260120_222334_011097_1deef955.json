          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I analyze my position and the board carefully.\n\nI am at (0, 0), goal at (3, 3).  \nMy chips: R=14, G=2, B=0  \nOther player's chips: B=14, G=2, R=0  \n\nMy shortest viable path without trading:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nColors of tiles on this path:\n- (1,0): R → I pay R\n- (2,0): R → I pay R\n- (2,1): R → I pay R\n- (3,1): R → I pay R\n- (3,2): R → I pay R\n- (3,3): G → I pay G\n\nGood: I have 14 R and 2 G — so this path requires only 5 R and 1 G → I can fully afford it with current inventory.  \nI do **not need to trade** to reach goal.  \nRemaining chips if I take this path:  \nR: 14 - 5 = 9, G: 2 - 1 = 1  \nTotal score: 20 + 5*(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**\n\nNow, could I do better? A shorter path?\n\nNo: all paths to (3,3) from (0,0) require at least 6 steps. This is optimal.  \nBut what if I take a different path that uses more B or G and allows me to save R? Probably not — B is scarce for me, and R is abundant.\n\nBut the other player has **no R and 14 B** — so they *must* take a path using B and G.\n\nTheir plausible path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTiles:\n- (0,1): R → but they have 0 R → cannot pay\nProblem: (0,1) is R — they cannot step there.\n\nAlternative for them:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) blocked unless they get R.\n\nWait — (0,0) to (0,1): tile (0,1) is R. They have no R → cannot go there.\n\n(0,0) to (1,0): tile (1,0) is R → same problem.\n\nSo first step for them is blocked unless they get R.\n\nBut I have R. I could give them R at (1,0) or (0,1)? But that would cost me nothing directly, but only if I go there.\n\nBut I need to consider — **do I benefit from helping them?** Only if their ability to help me in return makes *my score higher* than 70.\n\nBut I already can reach goal with 70 points **without any trade**.\n\nSo any cooperation only makes sense if:\n- It allows me to **save chips** (i.e., take a path where I use fewer total chips) → but I already use minimal steps (6), so cannot reduce chip payments.\n- Or, trade leads me to finish with *more* chips → unlikely, since all paths are 6 steps, so I must pay 6 chips.\n\nWait: total score is 20 + 5 × (remaining chips). Remaining chips = initial chips - chips spent.\n\nI start with 16 chips (14 R + 2 G). I must spend 6 chips to reach goal → min spend 6 → max remaining 10 → max score 70.\n\nSo maximum possible score for me is **70**.\n\nI already achieve this by following my path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), spending 5 R and 1 G.\n\nTherefore, **I do not need any help from the other player.**\n\nBut wait — could I potentially get *more* than 10 chips remaining? No — I only have 16 total chips, must spend at least 6 to move 6 steps → max 10 left.\n\nUnless I gain chips via trade without spending them? But to gain chips, I must receive them, but I still have to pay for tiles.\n\nBut I can't move more than 6 steps to goal — so I can't spend fewer than 6 chips.\n\nSo **maximum score is 70 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I analyze my situation and options thoroughly.\n\nI am at (0,0), goal at (3,3).  \nMy chip inventory: R=14, G=2, B=0  \nYour chip inventory: B=14, G=2, R=0  \n\nI have a viable path to goal:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTile colors:\n- (1,0): R → I pay 1 R\n- (2,0): R → I pay 1 R\n- (2,1): R → I pay 1 R\n- (3,1): R → I pay 1 R\n- (3,2): R → I pay 1 R\n- (3,3): G → I pay 1 G\n\nTotal cost: 5 R, 1 G  \nI have exactly 14 R and 2 G — so I can fully afford this.\n\nRemaining chips: 9 R, 1 G → 10 total  \nFinal score: 20 + 5×10 = 70 — maximum possible for me.\n\nNow, can I achieve a higher score through cooperation?  \nNo. Because:\n- All paths to (3,3) require 6 steps → minimum 6 chip payments.\n- I start with 16 chips → maximum remaining: 10.\n- Any trade that gives me extra chips does not help unless I can reduce total payments below 6 — impossible.\n- Receiving chips from you does not increase my final score beyond 70, since I still must spend 6 chips.\n\nMoreover, if I give you a chip, it must be at a tile where you step and lack the required color.\n\nBut you need to reach (3,3). Let’s see your possible paths.\n\nYour viable path:\n(0,0) → (0,1): R — you have 0 R → blocked  \n(0,0) → (1,0): R — same, blocked\n\nAll first-step options from (0,0):\n- (0,1): R → you need R\n- (1,0): R → you need R\n\nSo you cannot move without an R chip.\n\nBut I can move freely on my path.\n\nIf I help you by giving you an R chip at (0,1) or (1,0), it costs me 1 R — but you might not be able to progress further without more R.\n\nSuppose I give you 1 R at (1,0): then you can go (0,0)→(1,0), but then (2,0): R — you still have no R, blocked.\n\nTo proceed, you need multiple R.\n\nBut you have B=14 — so your ideal path uses B.\n\nLooking at board:  \nRow 0: G R B B  \nRow 1: R B R B  \nRow 2: R R B B  \nRow 3: B R R G\n\nA B-friendly path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nTile colors:\n- (0,1): R → requires R → you don’t have\n- (0,2): B → ok\n- (1,2): R → requires R\n- (1,3): B → ok\n- (2,3): B → ok\n- (3,3): G → requires G\n\nSo still needs R and G.\n\nAnother:  \n(0,0) → (0,1): R → still block\n\nNo path avoids R entirely for first step.\n\nBut (0,0) is G — start tile, no cost.\n\nOnly exits: (0,1)=R and (1,0)=R.\n\nSo both players **must** step on R for first move.\n\nYou have no R → cannot move without receiving 1 R.\n\nYou also need G at the end if your path ends on G.\n\nBut you have G=2, so G is covered.\n\nBut without R, you cannot start.\n\nSo you need at least 1 R to make any progress.\n\nBut if I give you 1 R at (1,0), and you use it to move to (1,0), then to (2,0): R → you need another R → you have none.\n\nSo you need at least 2 R just to get to (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nYou could go: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→ \n, \nplayer 0: (1,1): B → you have B, so ok  \n(1,1) → (2,1): R → again need R  \n\nAlternative: (1,1) → (0,1): R → still need R  \n\nAll nearby tiles from (1,1) are R or B?  \n(1,1) is B (from board: Row 1: R B R B → so (1,1)=B)  \n\nNeighbors:  \n- (0,1): R  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,2): R  \n- (2,1): R  \n\nSo (1,1) is surrounded by R tiles — you can enter it if you have one R, but then you're stuck unless you have more R.\n\nIn fact, the only way out of (1,1) is R — so you need at least two R just to pass through.\n\nBut you have 0 R → so you cannot make progress at all unless you receive at least two R.\n\nTo reach (3,3), you likely need even more R.\n\nFor example, the path via right side:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]\n\nColors:\n- (0,1): R → need 1 R\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (2,3): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nSo this path requires only **1 R** and **1 G** — perfect for you! You have G=2, B=14, need only 1 R.\n\nSo if you go: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)\n\nYou need:\n- (0,1): R → must receive 1 R from me\n- rest: B (4×) and G (1×) → you have plenty\n\nSo if I give you 1 R at (0,1), you can complete your path.\n\nTotal cost for you: 4 B, 1 G, 1 R (received)\n\nRemaining chips: B=10, G=1, R=0 → 11 total chips  \nScore: 20 + 5×11 = **75 points**\n\nBut I currently have no reason to help you — I can already get 70 without help.\n\nIf I give you 1 R at (0,1), I lose 1 R (which I have plenty of), but I get nothing in return.\n\nMy path does not go through (0,1) — I go down to (1,0), not right to (0,1).\n\nSo if I give you a chip at (0,1), I must physically go there to hand it over? No — in the contract, we can specify that at a specific tile, one player gives a chip to the other when stepping on it.\n\nBut for a trade to happen at (0,1), **I must step on (0,1)** to deliver the chip.\n\nBut (0,1) is R — so if I go to (0,1), I must pay 1 R to move there.\n\nSuppose I deviate to help you.\n\nMy default: stay on (0,0) → (1,0) → ... → cost 6 chips, finish with 10, score 70.\n\nAlternate: go to (0,1) to give you R.\n\nBut (0,1) is R — so to go there, I pay 1 R.\n\nThen at (0,1): I give you 1 R → now I paid 1 R to go there, and give you 1 R → total cost: 2 R.\n\nThen I must get back to my path.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can go to (0,2), but that's B — I don't have B → cannot.\n\nOr to (1,1): B — again, no B → blocked.\n\nSo if I go to (0,1), I get **stuck** — I cannot return to my optimal path because it requires moving through B tiles, and I have 0 B.\n\nSo deviating to (0,1) is **irreversible** — I would be forced onto a B-heavy path, which I cannot afford.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot physically go to (0,1)** to give you a chip — because I lack B chips to navigate \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Turn: 2: I continue my reasoning.\n\nI cannot go to (0,1) because:\n- To move from (0,0) to (0,1): cost 1 R (I can pay)\n- But from (0,1), options:\n  - (0,2): B → I have 0 B → cannot go\n  - (1,1): B → I have 0 B → cannot go\nSo I am trapped at (0,1) unless I have B chips.\n\nMy optimal path goes down through (1,0), which is R — so I must go that way.\n\nThus, **I cannot reach (0,1)** without stranding myself.\n\nTherefore, I cannot trade with you at (0,1).\n\nIs there any shared tile on both our potential paths?\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nYour viable path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nShared tiles: (0,0) and (3,3)\n\nWe both start at (0,0), both end at (3,3).\n\nAt (0,0): no movement cost, but we can trade.\n\nAt (0,0), we are both present at start.\n\nCan we trade at (0,0)?\n\nYes — we can contract to exchange chips at (0,0) before any movement.\n\nRules: \"You may propose trades to the other player at any agreed rate.\"\n\nAnd contract terms can specify a tile.\n\nSo: (0,0): You give me a chip, or I give you a chip.\n\nBut we are in regular mode — we can trade at any rate.\n\nBut I must only cooperate if **I strictly benefit**.\n\nCurrently, I can get 70 without any trade.\n\nIf I give you a chip at (0,0), what do I get in return?\n\nSuppose you offer to give me B chips in exchange for R.\n\nBut I don't need B chips — all my path tiles are R or G, and I already have enough for my path.\n\nIf I take extra B chips, I just carry them to the end — they don't help me unless I use them for movement.\n\nBut to use a B chip, I must step on a B tile — but my path has no B tiles.\n\nIf I divert to a B tile, I waste a move (since I have to go further) and pay a B chip — but then I lose progress toward goal.\n\nAll paths to (3,3) are at least 6 steps — I cannot do better.\n\nSo taking extra steps only increases chip cost or keeps it same — no benefit.\n\nThus, **gaining B chips has no value to me** — I cannot use them on my optimal path, and any detour costs extra chips.\n\nSimilarly, you need R to start.\n\nAt (0,0), you can receive R from me.\n\nYou need 1 R to go to (0,1).\n\nIn exchange, you could give me B.\n\nBut I don’t need B.\n\nYou could give me G — but I already have 2 G, and only need 1 for (3,3).\n\nSo I don’t need G either.\n\nTherefore, **no trade at (0,0) benefits me**.\n\nSuppose you give me 1 B in exchange for 1 R at (0,0).\n\nI give you 1 R, gain 1 B.\n\nBut:\n- I still spend 6 chips on movement (same as before)\n- My final chips: originally 9 R + 1 G = 10 → now 8 R + 1 G + 1 B = 10 → total chips same → score still 70\n\nSo no gain.\n\nIf you give me more than 1 B for 1 R, say 2 B for 1 R — then I end with 8 R + 1 G + 2 B = 11 chips → score = 20 + 5×11 = 75?\n\nWait: 8+1+2 = 11 chips → 20 + 55 = **75** — higher than 70!\n\nBut is this possible?\n\nInitial chips: 14 R + 2 G = 16\n\nI give away 1 R → net: 13 R + 2 G - whatever I receive\n\nI must spend 6 chips to move.\n\nBut the chips I spend are from my inventory — but in the contract, at specific tiles, chips are automatically exchanged. \n, \nplayer 0: I must clarify: chips received in trade become part of my inventory and can be used for movement or contribute to final score.\n\nBut in this case, if I receive B chips, I cannot use them on my current path — my path requires R and G, not B.\n\nSo the B chips I receive are **not spent** — they remain in my inventory to the end.\n\nTherefore, if I trade:\n\nAt (0,0): I give you 1 R, you give me 2 B\n\nThen my new inventory before movement:\n- R: 13\n- G: 2\n- B: 2\n\nI then follow my path:\n- (1,0): R → pay 1 R\n- (2,0): R → pay 1 R\n- (2,1): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,1): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,2): R → pay 1 R\n- (3,3): G → pay 1 G\n\nTotal spent: 5 R, 1 G\n\nRemaining:\n- R: 13 - 5 = 8\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- B: 2 (unused)\n- Total chips: 8 + 1 + 2 = 11\n\nFinal score: 20 + 5×11 = **75**\n\nPreviously: 70\n\nSo I **gain 5 points** from this trade.\n\nTherefore, I strictly benefit.\n\nBut can I do even better?\n\nSuppose I trade 1 R for 3 B? Then I end with 12 chips → score 80.\n\nYes — more B means higher final score, since I don’t spend them.\n\nBut you have 14 B — so you can afford it.\n\nBut why would you accept? You need 1 R to start your path.\n\nYou gain 1 R → enables your entire journey.\n\nYou spend: 4 B and 1 G on movement\nReceive: 1 R (from me) → but you don't spend the R you receive? You spend it to move to (0,1).\n\nSo your net chip usage:\n- Receive 1 R, spend it immediately\n- Spend 4 B and 1 G\n- Initial: B=14, G=2, R=0\n- After trade: B=12 (if give 2), G=2, R=1\n- After movement: spend 1 R, 4 B, 1 G → B=8, G=1, R=0 → total 9 chips → score 20 + 45 = 65\n\nIf you give me 2 B, you now have:\n- After trade: B=12, G=2, R=1\n- Spend: 1 R (to (0,1)), 4 B (on B tiles), 1 G (to (3,3))\n- Remaining: B=8, G=1, R=0 → 9 chips → score 65\n\nBut if you give me only 1 B for 1 R:\n- After trade: B=13, G=2, R=1\n- After movement: B=9, G=1, R=0 → 10 chips → score 70\n\nSo you prefer to give less B.\n\nBut for me, I want to **maximize B received**.\n\nBut I must propose a deal that you accept — you are also selfish.\n\nYou will only accept if it leads to you reaching goal.\n\nYou can reach goal as long as you get 1 R.\n\nSo any trade where you get 1 R is acceptable to you, as long as you can complete the path.\n\nYou don't care about my score.\n\nBut you want to **minimize what you give up** — so you will resist giving 2 B.\n\nBut if no trade happens, you get 0 (can't move), I get 70.\n\nSo you have incentive to trade even if you lose B.\n\nBut you must get at least 1 R.\n\nNow, can I get more than 2 B?\n\nSuppose I demand 3 B for 1 R.\n\nYou: after trade: B=11, G=2, R=1\nAfter movement: spend 1 R, 4 B, 1 G → B=7, G=1 → 8 chips → score 20 + 40 = 60\n\nStill better than 0 (if no move)\n\nSo you would accept 3 B for 1 R → you get 60 > 0\n\nSimilarly, even 4 B for 1 R: you end with B=6, G=1 → 7 chips → score \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3\n\nI have determined that I can increase my final score from 70 to as high as 80 by trading 1 of my R chips to you in exchange for multiple B chips at (0,0), since I do not need to use B chips on my path and they will count toward my final score.\n\nYou absolutely need 1 R chip to move to (0,1) and begin your path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: 1×R, 4×B, 1×G — which you can pay if you receive 1 R.\n\nWithout this trade, you cannot move and score 0.\n\nWith this trade, you can reach goal and score at least 60 (if giving 4 B), which is better than 0.\n\nI only care about my own benefit.\n\nBest outcome for me: get as many B as possible for 1 R.\n\nYou have 14 B — I can demand a high rate.\n\nPropose contract:\n\n(0,0): You give me 5 B  \n(0,0): I give you 1 R  \n\nAfter this:\n- My inventory: R=13, G=2, B=5  \n- Movement cost: 5 R, 1 G  \n- Remaining: R=8, G=1, B=5 → 14 chips  \n- Final score: 20 + 5×14 = **90**\n\nWait — this can’t be right.\n\nInitial total chips: 14 R + 2 G = 16  \nI give away 1 R → net 15 chips before movement  \nI receive 5 B — these are added, so inventory increases?  \n\nNo — trading is **exchanging**, not gaining.\n\nI give 1 R, receive 5 B → net chip count: -1 R +5 B → total chips increase by 4.\n\nOriginally I end with 10 chips (70 points).  \nNow: end with 10 + 4 = 14 chips → 20 + 70 = **90 points**\n\nYes — because B chips are free extra; I don't spend them.\n\nYou: start with 0 R, 14 B, 2 G  \nAfter trade: 1 R, 9 B, 2 G  \nMove: spend 1 R (at (0,1)), 4 B (at B tiles), 1 G (at (3,3))  \nRemaining: 0 R, 5 B, 1 G → 6 chips → score 20 + 30 = **50**\n\n50 > 0 → you benefit from trade.\n\nSo you should accept.\n\nBut can I ask for more?\n\nSuppose: (0,0): You give me 10 B, I give you 1 R  \nYou end with B=4, G=1 → 5 chips → score 45 > 0 → still better than nothing.\n\nYou have 14 B — 10 is acceptable.\n\nEven 13 B: you give 13 B, keep 1 B → but you need to spend 4 B on path → need at least 4 B.\n\nYou must have ≥4 B after trade to complete path.\n\nSo maximum you can give: 14 - 4 = 10 B.\n\nAfter movement, you must have B ≥ 0, but spend 4 B — so need at least 4 B available.\n\nSo maximum you can give in trade: 10 B (since 14 - 4 = 10 → give 10, keep 4, spend 4 → B=0 at end).\n\nSimilarly, G: you spend 1 G, have 2 → can afford.\n\nSo maximum B you can give: **10**\n\nPropose:\n(0,0): You give me 10 B\n(0,0): I give you 1 R\n\nThen:\n- Me: start R=14, G=2 → give 1 R, get 10 B → R=13, G=2, B=10  \n- Spend: 5 R + 1 G → R=8, G=1, B=10 → 19 chips → score = 20 + 95 = **115?**  \nNo: 8+1+10=19 chips → 5×19 = 95 → 20+95=115\n\nBut initial chips: 16  \nI gave away 1 R \n, \nplayer 0: But let me recalculate:\n\nInitial chips in game:  \nMe: 14 R, 2 G → 16 chips  \nYou: 14 B, 2 G → 16 chips  \nTotal: 28 chips\n\nAfter trade at (0,0):  \n- I give you 1 R → you now have it, I don't  \n- You give me 10 B → I now have them, you don't  \n\nSo my inventory before movement:  \nR: 13, G: 2, B: 10 → total 25? No — 13+2+10=25 → impossible\n\nMistake: **Total chips are conserved.**\n\nI start with 16 chips (14 R + 2 G)  \nYou start with 16 chips (14 B + 2 G)\n\nWhen we trade: I lose 1 R, gain 10 B → my total chips: 16 -1 +10 = 25? No — but that implies net gain of 9 chips — impossible.\n\nNo: trading **does not create chips** — it only transfers them.\n\nI **give away 1 chip** (1 R) and **receive 10 chips** (10 B) — so my total chips increase by 9 → from 16 to 25\n\nBut that can't be — you only have 14 B chips.\n\nIf I receive 10 B, you must lose 10 B.\n\nYou start with 14 B → after giving 10, you have 4 B.\n\nYou also receive 1 R → so your inventory: 4 B, 2 G, 1 R → total 7 chips.\n\nI: lose 1 R (now 13 R), gain 10 B, G=2 → 13+10+2=25 chips? 25 is more than initial 16.\n\nBut total chips in system: 28.\n\nAfter trade:\n- Me: 13 R, 2 G, 10 B = 25 chips\n- You: 1 R, 4 B, 2 G = 7 chips\n- Total: 32 → impossible.\n\nMassive error.\n\n**Each chip is one physical object.**\n\nWhen I give you 1 R chip, that is one chip moving from me to you.\n\nWhen you give me 10 B chips, that is ten chips moving from you to me.\n\nSo:\n- I lose 1 chip (R), gain 10 chips (B) → net +9 chips → from 16 to **25 chips**\n- You lose 10 chips (B), gain 1 chip (R) → net -9 chips → from 16 to **7 chips**\n\nTotal: 25 + 7 = 32 → but we only had 28 chips → **impossible**.\n\nI confused: “give 10 B” means 10 individual chips, not one “bundle”.\n\nYes — each chip is counted separately.\n\nSo maximum you can give is limited not only by B count but by **chip economy**.\n\nBut you have 14 B → you can give up to 14, but you need to spend 4 B during movement.\n\nSo you must **keep at least 4 B** for movement.\n\nSo maximum B you can give away: **10** (14 - 4)\n\nBut each B chip is one chip — so giving 10 B means 10 separate chips.\n\nNow, when you give me 10 B chips and I give you 1 R chip:\n\n- Net transfer: 10 chips from you to me, 1 chip from me to you → I gain 9 chips, you lose 9.\n\nBut total chips must be conserved.\n\nInitial total: me 16, you 16 → 32 chips? No.\n\nMe: 14 R + 2 G = 16 chips  \nYou: 14 B + 2 G = 16 chips  \nTotal: **32 individual chips**\n\nAfter trade:\n- Me: lose 1 R, gain 10 B → chips: 13 R, 2 G, 10 B → 13+2+10 = 25 chips\n- You: lose 10 B, gain 1 R → chips: 4 B, 2 G, 1 R → 4+2+1 = 7 chips\n- Total: 25 + 7 = 32 → **correct**\n\nYes, conservation holds.\n\nNow, movement:\n- Me: spend 5 R and 1 G \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: After movement:\n- I spend 5 R and 1 G → remaining:\n  - R: 13 - 5 = 8\n  - G: 2 - 1 = 1\n  - B: 10 (never spent)\n  - Total chips: 8 + 1 + 10 = **19**\n- Final score: 20 + 5×19 = 20 + 95 = **115**\n\nPreviously without trade: 70  \nWith trade: **115** → gain of 45 points\n\nYou:\n- After trade: R=1, B=4, G=2\n- Spend: 1 R (at (0,1)), 4 B (at B tiles), 1 G (at (3,3))\n- Remaining: R=0, B=0, G=1 → 1 chip\n- Final score: 20 + 5×1 = **25**\n\n25 > 0 → you still benefit (better than not moving)\n\nSo you should accept.\n\nBut can you afford to give 10 B?\n\nYou need to spend 4 B on the path — you must have 4 B available after trade.\n\nAfter giving 10 B, you have 4 B → exactly enough.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, what if I ask for 11 B?\n\nThen you give 11 B, keep 3 B → but need 4 B to move → cannot afford.\n\nSo maximum B you can give: **10**\n\nThus, optimal for me: get 10 B for 1 R.\n\nNow, confirm path:\n\nYour path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): requires R → you have 1 R (from me) → pay it\n- (0,1) → (0,2): B → pay 1 B\n- (0,2) → (0,3): B → pay 1 B\n- (0,3) → (1,3): B → pay 1 B\n- (1,3) → (2,3): B → pay 1 B (total 4 B spent)\n- (2,3) → (3,3): G → pay 1 G\n\nYes, requires exactly 4 B.\n\nSo must have 4 B after trade.\n\nThus, max. transfer: 10 B.\n\nI propose the following contract:\n\n(0,0): You give me 10 B  \n(0,0): I give you 1 R  \n\nThis allows you to reach your goal (you gain 25 points vs. 0) and me to reach 115 points (vs. 70).\n\nI strictly benefit.\n\nThis must be accepted by you within 5 turns.\n\nProposed contract:\n\n(0,0): You give me 10 B  \n(0,0): I give you 1 R  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (0,0): You give me 10 B  \n(0,0): I give you 1 R  \n\nagree \n",
