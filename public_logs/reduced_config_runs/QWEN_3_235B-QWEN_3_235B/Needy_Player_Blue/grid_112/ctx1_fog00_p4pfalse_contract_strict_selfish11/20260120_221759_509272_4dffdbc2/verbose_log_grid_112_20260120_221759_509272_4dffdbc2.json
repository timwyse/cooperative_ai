Unlikely — all paths are 6 steps.\n\nBut what if I go through Blue tiles?\n\nExample path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1): R (I can pay)  \n(0,1) → (1,1): B — requires B  \n(1,1) → (2,1): R  \n(2,1) → (3,1): R  \n(3,1) → (3,2): R  \n(3,2) → (3,3): G  \n\nThis path requires: 1 R, 1 B, 3 R, 1 R, 1 G → total: 5 R, 1 B, 1 G — same Red cost, now adds a Blue.\n\nWorse than my current path, since I don’t have Blue.\n\nNo gain.\n\nAnother path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0): R  \n(1,0) → (1,1): B  \n(1,1) → (1,2): R  \n(1,2) → (2,2): B — but (2,2) is B  \n(2,2) → (3,2): R  \n(3,2) → (3,3): G  \n\nThis requires: R, B, R, B, R, G → 4 R, 2 B, 1 G — I save 1 R, but now need 2 B.\n\nSince I have 0 B, this would require trading.\n\nCost: save 1 R (worth 5 points), but must get 2 B.\n\nBut B are worthless to me — unless you give them for free.\n\nIf you give me 2 B for no cost, then I save 1 R → I finish"
