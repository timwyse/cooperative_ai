I already have enough Red and Green to cover that path:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nI can complete this path without any help from you, because I already have 14 Red and 2 Green. Therefore, I don’t *need* any of your chips.\n\nHowever, let's consider your position. Your best path likely uses Blue and Green, for example:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThis requires 4 Blue, 1 Red, and 1 Green. You have 14 Blue, so Blue is not an issue. But you have 0 Red and only 2 Green — so you need just 1 Red.\n\nIf you go this route, you require **1 Red chip** to move from (2,3) to (3,3)? Wait — no: (2,3) is R, (3,3) is G. So you need to move onto (3,3), which is Green — so you need **1 Green** there. But (2,3) to (3,3) is down, onto a Green tile — so yes, you need 1 Green chip. Wait, but (2,3) is R? No — let's check board:\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R R R B  \nRow 2: R B R R  \nRow 3: B B R G\n\nSo (2,3) is R, (3,3) is G → so yes, moving to (3,3) requires 1 Green chip.\n\nBut you already have 2 Green — so you **also** have enough to reach (3,3) without help.\n\nIn fact, you can go:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R]? Wait — (1,3) to (2,3): (1,3) is B, (2,3) is R — so you need 1 Red to step onto (2,3). But you have 0 Red. So you **cannot** move to (2,3) without a Red chip.\n\nAh! So you need **1 Red chip** to move onto (2,3), and then **1 Green** to move onto (3,3). But you already have 2 Green — so Green is fine.\n\nSo your issue is **Red** — you need 1 Red to enter (2,3).\n\nNow, I have 14 Red and don’t need any of them for the path I plan to take? Wait — do I?\n\nLet’s recheck my path requirements:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0): tile (1,0) is R → need 1 Red  \n(1,0) → (1,1): (1,1) is R → need 1 Red  \n(1,1) → (1,2): (1,2) is R → need 1 Red  \n(1,2) → (2,2): (2,2) is R → need 1 Red  \n(2,2) → (3,2): (3,2) is R → need 1 Red  \n(3,2) → (3,3): (3,3) is G → need 1 Green\n\nSo yes, that's 5 Red and 1 Green — I have them.\n\nBut — you need 1 Red for (2,3).\n\nSo if you go via the top row, you need:\n(0,0) → (0,1): B  \n(0,1) → (0,2): B  \n(0,2) → (0,3): B  \n(0,3) → (1,3): B  \n(1,3) → (2,3): R → **you can’t do this without Red**\n\nSo you need 1 Red to enter ("

I have 14 Blue and 2 Green chips — so I only lack 1 Red to cover that single step.\n\nHowever, I also have an alternative path that avoids Red entirely. Let’s reassess all possible paths.\n\nCan I reach (3,3) without using any Red?\n\nTry this path:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B]  \n(0,1) → (0,2) [B]  \n(0,2) → (0,3) [B]  \n(0,3) → (1,3) [B] — still good  \n(1,3) → (2,3): (2,3) is R — would need Red — blocked.  \nCan I go (1,3) → (1,2)? (1,2) is R — also Red.  \n(1,2) → (1,1): R — again Red.  \n(1,1) → (2,1): (2,1) is B → okay, but I still need to traverse Red tiles to get there.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), go down through Blue tiles only.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B]  \n(0,1) → (0,2) [B]  \n(0,2) → (0,3) [B]  \n(0,3) → (1,3) [B]  \n(1,3) → (2,3): R — stuck.\n\nWhat if I go:\n(0,0) → (1,0)? (1,0) is R — need Red.\n\nNo move from (0,0) except (0,1) [B] and (1,0) [R]. So only (0,1) is accessible without Red or Green.\n\nSo my only starting move is (0,1), which is Blue — I can do that.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can go:\n- (0,2): B — good\n- (1,1): R — need Red\n\nSo again, I’m forced onto (0,2), then (0,3), then (1,3).\n\nNow from (1,3), adjacent tiles:\n- (0,3): B — back\n- (1,2): R — need Red\n- (2,3): R — need Red\n\nNo Blue tiles adjacent except the ones I came from. So to progress, I must step on a Red tile — either (1,2) or (2,3). But both require Red chips.\n\nSo unless I get 1 Red chip, I **cannot** progress from (1,3) to (2,3) or (1,2).\n\nTherefore, I **do need** 1 Red chip to make progress.\n\nBut I cannot reach (3,3) without leaving the top row eventually — and that requires stepping on Red.\n\nIs there a path that uses Green?\n\n(0,0) is G — I can stay there, but (3,3) is also G.\n\nBut from (0,0) to (3,3) directly? Not possible without traversing.\n\nWhat about going through the bottom Blue cluster?\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): B  \n→ (0,2): B  \n→ (0,3): B  \n→ (1,3): B  \nNow stuck unless I use Red.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), if I could go (1,0): R — need Red — but I have none.\n\nSo no. My only viable path still requires stepping on a Red tile.\n\nBut wait — what about this path?\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B]  \n→ (0,2) [B]  \n→ (1,2)? (1,2) is R — need Red  \nNo.\n\nAll paths from the top row down into row 2 or 3 require stepping on Red — and I need at least one Red chip.\n\nSo I **must** get 1 Red chip to proceed.\n\nBut I already have a path that requires only 1 Red — the top-right path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThis requires: 4×B, 1×R, 1×G — I have 14"

No.\n\nWait: score = 20 (for reaching) + 5 × (number of chips left)\n\nI start with: R:14, G:2\n\nMy path uses: 5 Red, 1 Green\n\nSo left with: 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nIf you cover my Green at (3,3), I don’t spend my own Green → left with 9 Red, 2 Green → 11 chips → 20 + 5×11 = 75\n\nSo I gain +5 points.\n\nYou: start with B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nYour path uses: 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green\n\nBut you have 0 Red — so without help, you **cannot** complete → get 0 points.\n\nWith me covering Red at (2,3): you use 4 Blue, 1 Green (own), Red covered by me.\n\nSo you save not having to use Red (but you don't have it anyway), and you use 1 of your Green.\n\nSo you end with: 10 Blue, 1 Green → 11 chips → 20 + 5×11 = 75\n\nWithout trade, you get 0 — so you gain 75.\n\nSo both benefit.\n\nBut I must"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I already have enough Red and Green to cover that path:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nI can complete this path without any help from you, because I already have 14 Red and 2 Green. Therefore, I don’t *need* any of your chips.\n\nHowever, let's consider your position. Your best path likely uses Blue and Green, for example:\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThis requires 4 Blue, 1 Red, and 1 Green. You have 14 Blue, so Blue is not an issue. But you have 0 Red and only 2 Green — so you need just 1 Red.\n\nIf you go this route, you require **1 Red chip** to move from (2,3) to (3,3)? Wait — no: (2,3) is R, (3,3) is G. So you need to move onto (3,3), which is Green — so you need **1 Green** there. But (2,3) to (3,3) is down, onto a Green tile — so yes, you need 1 Green chip. Wait, but (2,3) is R? No — let's check board:\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R R R B  \nRow 2: R B R R  \nRow 3: B B R G\n\nSo (2,3) is R, (3,3) is G → so yes, moving to (3,3) requires 1 Green chip.\n\nBut you already have 2 Green — so you **also** have enough to reach (3,3) without help.\n\nIn fact, you can go:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R]? Wait — (1,3) to (2,3): (1,3) is B, (2,3) is R — so you need 1 Red to step onto (2,3). But you have 0 Red. So you **cannot** move to (2,3) without a Red chip.\n\nAh! So you need **1 Red chip** to move onto (2,3), and then **1 Green** to move onto (3,3). But you already have 2 Green — so Green is fine.\n\nSo your issue is **Red** — you need 1 Red to enter (2,3).\n\nNow, I have 14 Red and don’t need any of them for the path I plan to take? Wait — do I?\n\nLet’s recheck my path requirements:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0): tile (1,0) is R → need 1 Red  \n(1,0) → (1,1): (1,1) is R → need 1 Red  \n(1,1) → (1,2): (1,2) is R → need 1 Red  \n(1,2) → (2,2): (2,2) is R → need 1 Red  \n(2,2) → (3,2): (3,2) is R → need 1 Red  \n(3,2) → (3,3): (3,3) is G → need 1 Green\n\nSo yes, that's 5 Red and 1 Green — I have them.\n\nBut — you need 1 Red for (2,3).\n\nSo if you go via the top row, you need:\n(0,0) → (0,1): B  \n(0,1) → (0,2): B  \n(0,2) → (0,3): B  \n(0,3) → (1,3): B  \n(1,3) → (2,3): R → **you can’t do this without Red**\n\nSo you need 1 Red to enter ("

I have 14 Blue and 2 Green chips — so I only lack 1 Red to cover that single step.\n\nHowever, I also have an alternative path that avoids Red entirely. Let’s reassess all possible paths.\n\nCan I reach (3,3) without using any Red?\n\nTry this path:\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B]  \n(0,1) → (0,2) [B]  \n(0,2) → (0,3) [B]  \n(0,3) → (1,3) [B] — still good  \n(1,3) → (2,3): (2,3) is R — would need Red — blocked.  \nCan I go (1,3) → (1,2)? (1,2) is R — also Red.  \n(1,2) → (1,1): R — again Red.  \n(1,1) → (2,1): (2,1) is B → okay, but I still need to traverse Red tiles to get there.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), go down through Blue tiles only.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B]  \n(0,1) → (0,2) [B]  \n(0,2) → (0,3) [B]  \n(0,3) → (1,3) [B]  \n(1,3) → (2,3): R — stuck.\n\nWhat if I go:\n(0,0) → (1,0)? (1,0) is R — need Red.\n\nNo move from (0,0) except (0,1) [B] and (1,0) [R]. So only (0,1) is accessible without Red or Green.\n\nSo my only starting move is (0,1), which is Blue — I can do that.\n\nFrom (0,1), I can go:\n- (0,2): B — good\n- (1,1): R — need Red\n\nSo again, I’m forced onto (0,2), then (0,3), then (1,3).\n\nNow from (1,3), adjacent tiles:\n- (0,3): B — back\n- (1,2): R — need Red\n- (2,3): R — need Red\n\nNo Blue tiles adjacent except the ones I came from. So to progress, I must step on a Red tile — either (1,2) or (2,3). But both require Red chips.\n\nSo unless I get 1 Red chip, I **cannot** progress from (1,3) to (2,3) or (1,2).\n\nTherefore, I **do need** 1 Red chip to make progress.\n\nBut I cannot reach (3,3) without leaving the top row eventually — and that requires stepping on Red.\n\nIs there a path that uses Green?\n\n(0,0) is G — I can stay there, but (3,3) is also G.\n\nBut from (0,0) to (3,3) directly? Not possible without traversing.\n\nWhat about going through the bottom Blue cluster?\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): B  \n→ (0,2): B  \n→ (0,3): B  \n→ (1,3): B  \nNow stuck unless I use Red.\n\nAlternatively, from (0,0), if I could go (1,0): R — need Red — but I have none.\n\nSo no. My only viable path still requires stepping on a Red tile.\n\nBut wait — what about this path?\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) [B]  \n→ (0,2) [B]  \n→ (1,2)? (1,2) is R — need Red  \nNo.\n\nAll paths from the top row down into row 2 or 3 require stepping on Red — and I need at least one Red chip.\n\nSo I **must** get 1 Red chip to proceed.\n\nBut I already have a path that requires only 1 Red — the top-right path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThis requires: 4×B, 1×R, 1×G — I have 14"

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Green', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Green', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample 2:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (3, 1).

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Green', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Therefore, I will reach the goal and have 9 + 2 = 11 chips left, giving me 20 + 5*11 = 75 points. No trade is needed because the contract covers the only tile (G) that would otherwise be a problem.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Green', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
