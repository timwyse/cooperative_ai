Moving from (3, 2) to (3, 3) requires 1 green chip, which I can afford. This is the final step to reach my goal. Once I reach (3, 3), I will complete the game and score 20 points plus 5 points for each of my remaining chips. After spending 1 green chip, I will have 6 blue and 1 green chip left, totaling 7 chips, giving me 20 + 7*5 = 55 points. There is no benefit in delaying this move. The other player has already finished and cannot block me. I do not need to trade because I already have the required chip. Therefore, moving now maximizes my score immediately and with certainty.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.
