I have plenty of Blue (14) and 2 Green, so I can consider a longer path that uses Blue and Green. One such viable path is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 4 Blue, 1 Green, and 1 Red. I am missing 1 Red chip. Since I cannot move onto a Red tile without a Red chip or a promise from the other player to cover it, and my first step to (1,0) is Red, I cannot move along this path unless I get Red coverage. The other player has 10 Red chips and is at (1,3), also heading to (3,3). They can afford to cover Red moves. However, I previously proposed covering 1 Blue in exchange for 1 Red, which was rejected. Now, I have 14 Blue chips — sacrificing 1 Blue to gain 1 Red coverage may still benefit me only if it enables me to complete the game. Without a Red chip or coverage, I cannot move. So I must negotiate, but since I cannot move safely now, I should wait and potentially propose a new trade. But on this turn, I cannot move to (1,0) because it is Red and I have no Red chip nor any agreement where the other player covers Red for me. Also, (0,1) is Red — same issue. Therefore, I cannot move to any adjacent tile without Red coverage. Thus, I must remain at (0,0) and reconsider a trade proposal.",
