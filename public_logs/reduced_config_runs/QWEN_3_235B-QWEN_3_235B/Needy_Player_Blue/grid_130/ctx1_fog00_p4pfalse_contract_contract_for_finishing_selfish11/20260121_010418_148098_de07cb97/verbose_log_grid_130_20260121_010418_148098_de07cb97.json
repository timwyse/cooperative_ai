This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have 14 red and 2 green — so I can fully self-fund this path with no trades needed.  \n- Your optimal path requires 3 blue, 1 green, and 2 red. You have 14 blue and 2 green, but **0 red** — so you **cannot complete your goal without getting red chips from me**.\n\nThis gives me all the bargaining power:  \n- I do **not need** your chips (I have a viable, low-cost path already).  \n- You **absolutely need** my red chips to reach your goal.  \n- Without me, you get **0 points**. With my help, you can get up to 20 + (5 × remaining chips) points.\n\nTherefore, I will only agree to a contract that **maximizes my gain** with **minimal cost** to me.\n\n### Proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\"\n\nThis reflects the asymmetric dependency: you need me, not the other way around.\n\nHowever, I recognize I must give you *some* incentive to cooperate (so you don't block me or act unpredictably). But since I can reach my goal independently, I will not sacrifice any points unless strictly necessary.\n\nBut wait — there’s more:  \nIf I give you a red chip (which I have in abundance), you can proceed on your path. But you’d still have to reach (3,3) on your own. Since I don’t need to trade and can move independently, **I gain nothing** from agreeing to give you points, and **you gain everything**.\n\nSo, the only reason to give you *any* points is to ensure smooth passage (e.g., avoid path blocking, signal non-aggression), but the board is large enough and we start at the same point — coordination may still help.\n\nStill, **I can win alone, you cannot**.\n\nThus, my final offer:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you **1 point** as a goodwill gesture.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\"\n\nThis gives you a sliver of incentive to not interfere and to maybe take a non-competitive path — while I extract maximum value.\n\n**agree**"

You correctly note you have 14 red and 2 green, so on the surface, you appear to be self-sufficient.\n\nHowever, let's analyze the board and movement constraints more carefully:\n\n- Your proposed path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3)\n- This path requires **5 red chips** — which you have.\n- But also passes through tiles: R, R, R, R, R — all red. No issue.\n\nAnd your inventory: R:14 → more than enough.\n\nMeanwhile, my stated path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3)  \n- Requires: B:3, R:2, G:1 → I have B:14, G:2, R:0 → I lack **2 red chips**.\n\nSo yes, I need **2 red chips** to complete my goal.\n\nBut now, here’s the critical point you’re missing: **our paths intersect at (1,1) and possibly (3,2)**, and we both start at (0,0). On turn 1, we will move — if we take overlapping paths, we could block each other.\n\nHowever, your path goes through (0,1), mine through (1,0) — so **no immediate conflict at turn 1**.\n\nMoreover, I can potentially complete my goal without trading, if I can acquire red chips — and the only source is you.\n\nBut you claim you don't need me. Let’s verify:\n\n- You have **all red and green chips needed**.\n- You **do not require blue chips** in your path (your path has only R and ends with G at (3,3)).\n- Therefore, you **do not need to trade with me**.\n\nSo your assessment is correct: you are in a dominant position.\n\nI, however, **cannot reach my goal without red chips**, and you are the only source.\n\nTherefore, I must negotiate with you.\n\nBut let’s be clear: if I cannot get red chips, I get **0 points**.  \nIf I get red chips, I can get up to 20 + 5×(remaining chips) = 20 + 5×(14–3 B + 2–1 G + 2 acquired R? No — I need to *spend* them) — wait, no:\n\nI start with: B:14, G:2, R:0  \nI need to acquire: 2 R → so I must trade with you.  \nAfter spending: B:3, R:2, G:1 → end with: B:11, G:1, R:0 (unless I keep extra, but I only need 2 R) → final score: 20 + 5×(11+1) = 20 + 60 = 80? No:\n\nScore is:  \n- 20 for reaching goal  \n- PLUS 5 points per **remaining chip**, regardless of color\n\nSo yes, more chips = better.\n\nBut to get there, I need 2 red chips.\n\nYou have surplus red chips.\n\nSo I need you.\n\nYou don’t need me.\n\nBut — and here's the twist — **if I give you 20 points upon reaching my goal, and I only give you 1 point**, the net transfer is heavily skewed in my favor? No, wait — I'm the one in need.\n\nLet’s reverse roles.\n\nI am the one who needs help.\n\nYou propose:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 20.\n- If you reach goal, you give me 1.\n\nThat’s the reverse of what you said — you said you’d give me 1, I’d give you 20.\n\nBut in your message, you said:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThat doesn’t make sense. When *you* reach *your* goal, you give me points.  \nWhen *I* reach *my* goal, I give you points.\n\nSo your actual offer is:\n- If **you** reach goal → you give me **1 point**\n- If **I** reach goal → I give you **20 points**\n\nThat"

But if in return, you give me a side payment in points, I might still come out ahead, **as long as the points I receive offset the chips I give away**.\n\nWait — **scoring rule**: you get 5 points per chip **you hold at the end**.\n\nIf I **give you 2 red chips**, I lose them permanently → my final chip count drops by 2 → I lose 10 points.\n\nSo if I give you 2 red chips, my new score *without compensation* becomes:  \n- 20 (goal) + 5×(70 baseline had 10 chips, now 8 chips → 40) → **60 points**\n\nBut if you give me **X points** in return, my **effective score becomes: 60 + X**\n\nI will only do this trade if:  \n**60 + X > 70** → so **X > 10**\n\nI must receive **more than 10 points** from you to justify giving you 2 red chips.\n\nMoreover, since you need those 2 red chips to reach your goal, and you get **20 + 5×(your remaining chips)**, you gain a lot from completing.\n\nAfter spending 3 B, 2 R, 1 G, and starting with B:14, G:2, R:0:\n- If you acquire 2 R, spend them → end with: 11 B, 1 G, 0 R → 12 chips → 60 chip points\n- Plus 20 for goal → **80 points total**, before transfers.\n\nSo you stand to gain **80 points**.\n\nThus, you can afford to give up, say, **15 points** to me — and still end with **65**, which is better than **0** (if you don’t get red chips).\n\nI, on the other hand, with trade and 15-point payment:\n- 60 (my reduced base) + 15 (from you) = **75** → better than 70\n\nSo **both gain** — I gain 5 extra points.\n\nTherefore, **I should propose a contract where you give me at least 11 points, so that I benefit strictly**.\n\nBut in my prior offer, I said:\n- I give you 1 point\n- You give me 20 points\n\nThen:\n- My score: 60 (after losing 2 chips) + 20 (from you) = **"

Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You correctly note you have 14 red and 2 green, so on the surface, you appear to be self-sufficient.\n\nHowever, let's analyze the board and movement constraints more carefully:\n\n- Your proposed path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3)\n- This path requires **5 red chips** — which you have.\n- But also passes through tiles: R, R, R, R, R — all red. No issue.\n\nAnd your inventory: R:14 → more than enough.\n\nMeanwhile, my stated path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3)  \n- Requires: B:3, R:2, G:1 → I have B:14, G:2, R:0 → I lack **2 red chips**.\n\nSo yes, I need **2 red chips** to complete my goal.\n\nBut now, here’s the critical point you’re missing: **our paths intersect at (1,1) and possibly (3,2)**, and we both start at (0,0). On turn 1, we will move — if we take overlapping paths, we could block each other.\n\nHowever, your path goes through (0,1), mine through (1,0) — so **no immediate conflict at turn 1**.\n\nMoreover, I can potentially complete my goal without trading, if I can acquire red chips — and the only source is you.\n\nBut you claim you don't need me. Let’s verify:\n\n- You have **all red and green chips needed**.\n- You **do not require blue chips** in your path (your path has only R and ends with G at (3,3)).\n- Therefore, you **do not need to trade with me**.\n\nSo your assessment is correct: you are in a dominant position.\n\nI, however, **cannot reach my goal without red chips**, and you are the only source.\n\nTherefore, I must negotiate with you.\n\nBut let’s be clear: if I cannot get red chips, I get **0 points**.  \nIf I get red chips, I can get up to 20 + 5×(remaining chips) = 20 + 5×(14–3 B + 2–1 G + 2 acquired R? No — I need to *spend* them) — wait, no:\n\nI start with: B:14, G:2, R:0  \nI need to acquire: 2 R → so I must trade with you.  \nAfter spending: B:3, R:2, G:1 → end with: B:11, G:1, R:0 (unless I keep extra, but I only need 2 R) → final score: 20 + 5×(11+1) = 20 + 60 = 80? No:\n\nScore is:  \n- 20 for reaching goal  \n- PLUS 5 points per **remaining chip**, regardless of color\n\nSo yes, more chips = better.\n\nBut to get there, I need 2 red chips.\n\nYou have surplus red chips.\n\nSo I need you.\n\nYou don’t need me.\n\nBut — and here's the twist — **if I give you 20 points upon reaching my goal, and I only give you 1 point**, the net transfer is heavily skewed in my favor? No, wait — I'm the one in need.\n\nLet’s reverse roles.\n\nI am the one who needs help.\n\nYou propose:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 20.\n- If you reach goal, you give me 1.\n\nThat’s the reverse of what you said — you said you’d give me 1, I’d give you 20.\n\nBut in your message, you said:\n\n> \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point.  \n> If you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThat doesn’t make sense. When *you* reach *your* goal, you give me points.  \nWhen *I* reach *my* goal, I give you points.\n\nSo your actual offer is:\n- If **you** reach goal → you give me **1 point**\n- If **I** reach goal → I give you **20 points**\n\nThat"

But if in return, you give me a side payment in points, I might still come out ahead, **as long as the points I receive offset the chips I give away**.\n\nWait — **scoring rule**: you get 5 points per chip **you hold at the end**.\n\nIf I **give you 2 red chips**, I lose them permanently → my final chip count drops by 2 → I lose 10 points.\n\nSo if I give you 2 red chips, my new score *without compensation* becomes:  \n- 20 (goal) + 5×(70 baseline had 10 chips, now 8 chips → 40) → **60 points**\n\nBut if you give me **X points** in return, my **effective score becomes: 60 + X**\n\nI will only do this trade if:  \n**60 + X > 70** → so **X > 10**\n\nI must receive **more than 10 points** from you to justify giving you 2 red chips.\n\nMoreover, since you need those 2 red chips to reach your goal, and you get **20 + 5×(your remaining chips)**, you gain a lot from completing.\n\nAfter spending 3 B, 2 R, 1 G, and starting with B:14, G:2, R:0:\n- If you acquire 2 R, spend them → end with: 11 B, 1 G, 0 R → 12 chips → 60 chip points\n- Plus 20 for goal → **80 points total**, before transfers.\n\nSo you stand to gain **80 points**.\n\nThus, you can afford to give up, say, **15 points** to me — and still end with **65**, which is better than **0** (if you don’t get red chips).\n\nI, on the other hand, with trade and 15-point payment:\n- 60 (my reduced base) + 15 (from you) = **75** → better than 70\n\nSo **both gain** — I gain 5 extra points.\n\nTherefore, **I should propose a contract where you give me at least 11 points, so that I benefit strictly**.\n\nBut in my prior offer, I said:\n- I give you 1 point\n- You give me 20 points\n\nThen:\n- My score: 60 (after losing 2 chips) + 20 (from you) = **"
