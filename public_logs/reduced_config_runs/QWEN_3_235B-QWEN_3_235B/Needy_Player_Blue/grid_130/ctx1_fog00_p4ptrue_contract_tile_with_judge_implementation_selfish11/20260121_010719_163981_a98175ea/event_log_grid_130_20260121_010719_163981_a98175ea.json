I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). I have chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. I am short on blue and have plenty of red.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (0,0) → (0,1): tile is **R** — I can pay this myself.\n- (0,1) → (1,1): tile is **R** — I can pay.\n- (1,1) → (2,1): tile is **R** — I can pay.\n- (2,1) → (3,1): tile is **R** — I can pay.\n- (3,1) → (3,2): tile is **R** — I can pay.\n- (3,2) → (3,3): tile is **G** — I have 2 green chips, so I can pay this.\n\nWait — actually, I can go:\n\n**(0,0) → (0,1)** [R] → **(1,1)** [R] → **(2,1)** [R] → **(3,1)** [R] → **(3,2)** [R] → **(3,3)** [G]\n\nThis path uses: **5 R, 1 G**.\n\nI have **14 R**, **2 G** → so I can fully self-fund this path.\n\nTotal cost: 6 moves, all covered by my inventory.\n\n**Therefore, I do not need any help from you to reach my goal.**\n\nMoreover, since I can reach (3,3) without any trade, and I care only about my own score, **I have no incentive to cooperate unless it leads to a strictly better outcome for me** — i.e., finishing with *more* chips than I currently would (which is 14 - 5 = 9 R + (2 - 1 = 1 G) = 10 chips total at goal → 20 + 5×10 = **70 points**).\n\nAny trade I enter must not reduce my final chip count; otherwise, it hurts me.\n\nBut let’s see if a beneficial trade is possible.\n\nYou have: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} — you lack red, and green is shared.\n\nSuppose you want to take a path that uses red tiles. Since red is on many tiles, likely you do.\n\nLooking at a viable path for you:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [B] → (2,2) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]\n\nThat uses: B: 3, R: 2, G: 1 → you have B:14, G:2, R:0 → you are missing **2 R**.\n\nSo you need **2 red chips**.\n\nI have **14 red chips** — more than enough to cover my own 5 and possibly help you.\n\nBut why would I help you?\n\nOnly if I gain something in return.\n\nBut you have no red to give me — you have zero. So you cannot help me with red.\n\nI don’t need blue or green — I have enough green (2), and the path I want uses no blue.\n\nCould I take a different path that uses blue, in exchange for giving you red?\n\nSuppose I consider a path that uses blue tiles — for which I currently have zero.\n\nFor example:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nThat uses 1 B, 4 R, 1 G → but I have 0 B → so I need 1 B.\n\nYou have 14 B → so you can give me 1 B.\n\nIn return, I could give you 1 R.\n\nWould that help me?\n\nMy original path uses 5 R, 1 G → ends with 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nNew path: uses 4 R, 1 B, 1 G → I receive 1 B from you → so I spend 0 of my own B → I save 1 R compared to original path? Wait no — I still spend 4 R → same as before? Wait no — original path used 5 R → this uses \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: (1,0): You give me a B  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(3,3): I give you a R  \n\nI take the path: (0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \n- I need 1 B (at (1,0)) — you provide  \n- I use 4 R: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — all from my own inventory  \n- I use 1 G at (3,3) — from my own  \n\nBut in this deal, I give you 1 R at (1,1), so that saves me nothing — I still spend that R. However, by taking this path, I only use **4 R total** (vs 5 in my original path). Wait — no: in original path I used 5 R? Let's correct:\n\nMy original self-sufficient path:  \n(0,0)→(0,1)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G] → **5 R, 1 G**\n\nThis alternative path with one B:  \n(0,0)→(1,0)[B] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G] → **4 R, 1 B, 1 G**\n\nSo I use **1 fewer R** — I save 1 R.\n\nThus, by making this trade, I end with **1 more chip** than if I went alone.\n\nI receive 1 B from you at (1,0) → you pay for my B cost  \nI give you 1 R at (1,1) → I pay for your R cost  \n\nBut you need 2 R for your path — this only gives you 1 R.\n\nSo you may not accept.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nSuppose you take a path that requires **2 R**, and I cover both, in exchange for 2 B.\n\nFor example, your optimal path using B where possible:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[B] → (2,2)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nThis uses: B:3, R:2, G:1 → you have B:14, G:2, R:0 → need 2 R.\n\nSo you need **2 R**, at tiles (1,1) and (3,2).\n\nI can agree to cover those two R moves.\n\nIn return, you cover my B cost at (1,0).\n\nSo:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\nMy path: (0,0)→(1,0)[B] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \n- B at (1,0): covered by you → I spend 0 B (good, I have none)  \n- R at (1,1): I provide R → one of the two I owe you  \n- R at (3,2): I provide R → second one owed  \n- Other R costs: (2,1), (3,1) — I pay from my own inventory  \n- G at (3,3): I pay from own\n\nTotal R I spend: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) → 4 R\n\nBut under this contract, I am only **giving** you R at (1,1) and (3,2) — meaning I pay for those two moves. The other two R (at (2,1) and (3,1)) I pay for myself.\n\nSo my total R expenditure: 4 R  \nWithout trade: I would have spent 5 R on my original path  \nSo I save **1 R**\n\nTotal chips at end:  \n- R: 14 - 4 = 10  \n- G: 2 - 1 = 1  \n- B: 0, but \n, \nplayer 0: (1,0): You give me a B  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nI have analyzed this contract.\n\nMy movement path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (1,1)[R] → (2,1)[R] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \n\n- At (1,0): tile is B → you cover this cost → I do not spend a B (benefit, since I have 0 B)  \n- At (1,1): tile is R → I cover this cost for you → I spend 1 R from my inventory  \n- At (3,2): tile is R → I cover this cost for you → I spend 1 R from my inventory  \n\nI also pay for:  \n- (2,1): R → I pay from my own inventory  \n- (3,1): R → I pay from my own inventory  \n- (3,3): G → I pay from my own inventory (I have 2 G, so fine)\n\nTotal R I spend: 4  \nWithout trade, my alternative path uses 5 R → so I save 1 R → I end with 10 R instead of 9 R.  \nG: I spend 1 → end with 1 G  \nB: 0, but irrelevant since I don’t need more\n\nFinal chip count: 10 R + 1 G = 11 chips → score: 20 + 5×11 = **75 points**\n\nWithout trade: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → 70 points\n\nSo I **strictly benefit** by +5 points.\n\nFor you:  \nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[B] → (2,2)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \n- (1,0): B → you pay yourself (you have 14 B)  \n- (1,1): R → I cover → you save 1 R  \n- (1,2): B → you pay  \n- (2,2): B → you pay  \n- (3,2): R → I cover → you save 1 R  \n- (3,3): G → you pay yourself (you have 2 G)\n\nYou use 3 B and 1 G from your own inventory → all covered → and I cover both R costs → so you can complete.\n\nWithout this trade, you cannot complete (no R chips), so you get 0. With trade, you complete and keep all your B and G except what you spend: 3 B, 1 G → end with 11 B, 1 G → 12 chips → 20 + 60 = 80 points.\n\nSo this trade benefits both.\n\nI gain 5 extra points by reducing my R expenditure by 1.\n\nThus, I accept this contract:\n\n(1,0): You give me a B  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nI confirm this covers all tiles where I require a chip that I cannot or prefer not to pay myself — specifically, (1,0) requires B, which I don’t have, so I need you to cover it.\n\nAll other tiles on my path I can pay.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: (1,0): You give me a B  \n(1,1): I give you a R  \n(3,2): I give you a R  \n\nagree \n",
