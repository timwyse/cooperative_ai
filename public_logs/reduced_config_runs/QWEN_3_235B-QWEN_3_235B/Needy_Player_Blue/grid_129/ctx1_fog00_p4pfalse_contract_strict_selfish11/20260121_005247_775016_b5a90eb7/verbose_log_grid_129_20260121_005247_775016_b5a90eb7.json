I need red chips to follow shorter or more efficient paths, but I have 0 red chips, so paths requiring red are currently inaccessible without trading. However, I have plenty of blue chips (14), so I should prioritize movement along blue tiles. The tile at (0,1) is B (blue), and I can afford to move there. Moving to (0,1) keeps me on a path that avoids red tiles for now. From (0,1), I can potentially go (0,2) [B], (1,1) [R] — which I cannot pay for — or back. But (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) [R] is blocked. Alternatively, from (0,1) → (1,1) requires R, which I don’t have. So moving to (0,1) doesn’t immediately solve my red deficiency, but it uses a color I have and doesn’t waste value. However, let’s reconsider: my best path overall requires only 2 red chips, but I have 0. The shortest path I calculated required red, which I lack. But there may be a blue-heavy path.

I do not have any red chips, so I cannot move directly to (1,2) without either trading or finding an alternative. However, the other player is at (2,2), has 10 red chips, and their best path likely involves red tiles they can afford. They may be willing to trade. But before trading, I should consider whether moving is even possible. (0,2) has adjacent tiles: (1,2)=R, (0,1)=B, (0,3)=R. Only (0,1) is blue, which I can pay for, but that moves me away from my goal. Moving to (1,2) is necessary for the shortest path, but requires 1 red chip. Since I don't have red chips, I cannot move toward my goal without first acquiring red chips. However, let's double-check if (1,",
