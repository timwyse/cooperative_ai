Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You have 14 Blue (B), 2 Green (G), and 0 Red (R).\n\nMy optimal path to (3, 3) requires: **5 Red, 1 Green** — I have *more than enough* Red and Green to complete it. I do **not need to trade** with you to reach my goal.\n\nYour optimal path requires Blue and Green. You have plenty of Blue and sufficient Green. You also likely do not need me.\n\nHowever, let's evaluate:\n\n- My shortest viable path:  \n  (0,0) → (1,0) [R], (1,0) → (1,1) [R], (1,1) → (1,2) [R], (1,2) → (2,2) [R], (2,2) → (3,2) [R], (3,2) → (3,3) [G]  \n  → Total: 5 R, 1 G — I have these.\n\n- Your shortest viable path using your chips:  \n  (0,0) → (0,1) [B], (0,1) → (0,2) [B], (0,2) → (0,3) [R] — Uh-oh. You have **no Red chips**.  \n  So you cannot use the top row to go right. Let’s check the left side:\n  (0,0) → (1,0) [R] — again, you have **no Red**.  \n  Alternatively: (0,0) → (1,0) requires R → blocked.  \n  (0,0) → (0,1) requires B — you have B. So start: (0,0) → (0,1) [B]  \n  (0,1) → (1,1) [R] — again, you have **no R**.  \n  (0,1) → (0,2) [B] → (0,2) → (1,2) [R] — again, R needed, you have no R.\n\nSo **every path south from row 0 requires stepping on a Red tile at some point** — and you have **0 Red chips**.\n\nThe only way to reach (3,3) is to go through at least one Red tile — unless going via (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) — but (3,0) → (3,1) is R, (3,1) → (3,2) is R — again, Red.\n\nWait: (2,0) → (3,0) is B → OK for you. (3,0) → (3,1) is R — problem.\n\nIn fact, *every possible path from (0,0) to (3,3) requires stepping on at least two Red tiles*.\n\nI checked:\n\n- (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → needs R\n- (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,1) → (1,1) [R] → needs R\n- (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) [R] → needs R\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] → two R required\n\nSo **you must use at least two Red chips to reach your goal** — but you have **0 Red**.\n\nTherefore, **you cannot reach your goal without Red chips**.\n\nMeanwhile, **I have 14 Red chips**, 5 needed for my path, so 9 leftover.\n\nBut — **I do not need you at all**.\n\nTherefore, **you need me, not the other way around**.\n\nI am in a strong position.\n\nHowever, I can consider giving you some Red chips in exchange for something — but only if it benefits me.\n\nBut note: the only way I benefit is if you give me points in return — because I can already reach my goal alone.\n\nThus:\n\nI propose:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **5 points** (enough to make you better off than 0"

Score: 20 + 9×5 = **65 points**.\n- You **cannot move past row 0 or column 0** without red chips — every viable path requires red tiles. You have 0 red → you are stuck unless I give you red chips.\n- Therefore, I control your ability to score.\n- Any trade must be favorable **to me**, because I gain nothing from you except what you offer in points.\n\nThus, if I give you red chips (say, 2 red), I lose 2 chips (but have plenty), and enable you to reach your goal — you then give me Y points.\n\nBut I can reach my goal regardless.\n\nSo the **only gain to me from cooperation is the points you give me**.\n\nTherefore, I will only cooperate if you give me **more than 0 points** — but obviously you will.\n\nBut I must maximise.\n\nSuppose you offer me X points if I reach goal (I will reach goal regardless), and I give you Y points if you reach goal.\n\nI should **minimize Y**, and **maximize X**.\n\nBut let's see your offer:  \n- You get 5 points if you reach goal (so you get 5 from me)  \n- I get 20 points if I reach goal (you pay me 20)\n\nSo net, I gain 20, you gain 5 — and you depend on me.\n\nWhy would I accept that? That’s great for me.\n\nBut wait — is this binding?\n\nYou said: \"**If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.**\"\n\nAnd you ended with \"**agree**\"\n\nBut **this is not symmetric** — you're giving me 20, I'm giving you 5.\n\nBut in the contract, each player says what they give to the other.\n\nSo:\n- You give me 20 if I reach my goal.\n- I give you 5 if you reach your goal.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, from my perspective:\n- I will reach my goal anyway → I get 20 from you for free.\n- In return, I must give you 5 only **if I help you reach your goal**.\n\nSo: if I give you 2 red chips (say), you can reach your goal → you get 20 + (your remaining chips)×5.\n\nBut I only give you 5 points.\n\nSo my final score:  \n- Base: 20 (goal) + (14 - 5 - 2 given) ×5 = 20 + 7×5 = 20 + 35 = 55  \n- Plus: 20 points from you → total score: 55 + 20 = **75**\n\nWithout any trade: I get 20 + 9×5 = 65.\n\nSo I gain **10 points** by cooperating.\n\nMeanwhile, you:\n- Without help: 0 (cannot move) → 0 points\n- With help: reach goal, pay me 5 points → your score: 20 + (14-2 for blue used? Wait, let's compute)\n\nAssume you go via (0,0)→(0,1)[B], (0,1)→(0,2)[B], (0,2)→(1,2)[R] – need 1 red, (1,2)→(2,2)[R] – 2nd red, (2,2)→(3,2)[R] – 3rd red, (3,2)→(3,3)[G]\n\nWait — you need 3 reds?

This only makes sense if both players end up with higher scores than they would have otherwise — but in zero-sum terms, it's only rational for me to give you points if doing so enables me to go from 0 to positive.\n\nCurrently:\n- **Other player (Red-rich)**: Can reach goal alone.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let’s check the left side:\n  (0,0) → (1,0) [R] — again, you have **no Red**.  \n  Alternatively: (0,0) → (1,0) requires R → blocked.  \n  (0,0) → (0,1) requires B — you have B.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
