Although this is not on the shortest path, it is a legal move and keeps me active. Moving to (0,0) costs 1 G, which I can afford. This could potentially reposition me for a future path if new trade opportunities arise, though currently none exist. However, since the other player has already finished and will not move again, no further trades are possible. Thus, moving to (0,0) does not improve my chances of reaching (3,3) but allows me to spend a chip without penalty. But critically: if I cannot reach (3,3), all chips are worthless and score 0. Moving away from the direct path without a way to obtain R chips only delays the inevitable. There is no benefit in moving to (0,0) — it does not bring me closer to the goal and wastes a G chip. Therefore, the only rational action is to stay put and not incur unnecessary costs. Since I cannot obtain R coverage and cannot move toward the goal without spending a chip I don't have, I should not move at all.",
