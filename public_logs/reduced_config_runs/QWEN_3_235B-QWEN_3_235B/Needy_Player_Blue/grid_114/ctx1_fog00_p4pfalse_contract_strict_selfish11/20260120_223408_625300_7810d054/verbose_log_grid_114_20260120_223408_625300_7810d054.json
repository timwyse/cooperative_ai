Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

My optimal path is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nThis requires: 1 Green, 5 Red — I already have enough chips for this. I can complete it alone with **no trades needed**.\n\nBut let's analyze your situation:  \nYou are at (0, 0), goal (3, 3), chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}.  \nA likely efficient path for you is:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \nThis requires: 4 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red.  \nBut you have **no Red chips** — you cannot complete this path without acquiring at least 1 Red.\n\nYou *must* trade with me for a Red chip to complete your most efficient path. Otherwise, you may be forced onto a longer or more costly route.\n\nHowever, **I do not need you** to reach my goal — I have enough chips to complete my path independently. Therefore, any cooperation must provide **strict benefit to me** — either more chips at the end or a shorter path (but my path is already minimal and feasible).\n\nBut: if I help you get a Red chip at a strategic tile, I might extract a favorable trade — one that increases my chip count at the end, **as long as it doesn't slow me down or cost me extra chips**.\n\nLet me consider potential mutual benefit.\n\nSuppose we coordinate paths so that we meet where trades can occur.\n\nYour path needs a **Red** chip at (2,3)? Let's see tile colors:\n\n- (0,0): G → I start here, you start here  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): R  \n- (0,3): B  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,1): R  \n- (1,2): B  \n- (1,3): R  \n- (2,0): B  \n- (2,1): R  \n- (2,2): B  \n- (2,3): B  \n- (3,0): B  \n- (3,1): R  \n- (3,2): R  \n- (3,3): G\n\nAh — (2,3) is **B**, so you would pay **Blue** to move there, not Red. The **Red** requirement for you comes from stepping on a **Red** tile — but in your optimal path:  \n(0,1): B → (1,1): R → so you need **Red** chip at (1,1)  \n(1,2): B → no issue  \n(2,2): B → no issue  \n(2,3): B → no issue  \n(3,3): G → need Green  \n\nWait — (1,1) is **Red**, so you must pay 1 Red chip to move from (1,0) or (1,2) to (1,1) — but (1,1) is reachable from (0,1): B → (1,1): R — you need a Red chip at (1,1).  \nYes — so **at tile (1,1)**, you must spend a Red chip.\n\nBut you have **0 Red** — so you **must** obtain 1 Red chip from me to step on (1,1), if you go via that route.\n\nSimilarly, other paths to (3,3) for you:\n\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (1,0): R → you need Red here too!  \n(1,0) is Red — same problem.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): B → (0,2): R → again, requires Red.\n\nAll paths from (0,0) require passing through a Red tile early — (0,2), (1,0), or (1,1) — all are Red. So you **cannot avoid** needing at least one Red chip.\n\nTherefore, you **cannot reach your goal without at least 1 Red chip** — and I have 14.\n\nBut I do **not** need to trade — I can go directly:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1"

You currently have 0 red chips, so **you cannot move without acquiring at least 1 red chip from me**.\n\nHowever, I do **not** need any of your chips—my full path uses only red and green, and I have 14 red and 2 green. I can complete my journey **independently, unimpeded, with no reliance on you**.\n\nThat means **you need me**, but **I do not need you**. Therefore, any trade must strictly **benefit me**, not just help you.\n\nThat said, I am willing to **sell** you a red chip—but only at a high price, one that increases my final chip count and thus my score.\n\nHere’s my proposal:\n\nLet’s synchronize at (1,1). I can go (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1). That uses my own chips. You can go (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1).\n\nAt (1,1), you require a red chip to enter (since (1,1) is red). I will give you **1 red chip** at that tile—in exchange for **2 blue chips** from you.\n\nWhy 2:1? Because:\n- You get the red chip you urgently need.\n- I **gain** 1 net chip: I give 1 red, receive 2 blue. Since blue is not useful to me (I have no blue tiles on my path), but having more chips increases my score if I reach goal. Even \"useless\" chips are worth 5 points each at the end.\n- You still benefit: Without this, you cannot move. With it, you can proceed, spend 1 red (which I give), and use your 14 blue for the rest.\n\nThe contract would include:\n\n(1,1): You give me 2 Blue  \n(1,1): I give you 1 Red\n\nAfter that, we each proceed independently.\n\nI still reach my goal with **14 red - 5 red used = 9 red used, gain 2 blue from you → 2 blue, 5 red, 2 green left → total chips: 9 → 20 + 5×9 = 65 points**\nWait: I start with 14 red, 2 green. I use 5 red and 1 green? No:\n\nMy path:  \n(0,0) G → pay green  \n(1,0) R → pay red  \n(1,1) R → pay red  \n(2,1) R → pay red  \n(3,1) R → pay red  \n(3,2) R → pay red  \n(3,3) G → pay green\n\nSo: 5 red, 2 green used. I have 14 red → 9 left, 2 green → 0 left.\n\nAfter trade: I give away 1 red → now 8 red left. But gain 2 blue.\n\nFinal chips: 8 red, 0 green, 2 blue → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points.\n\nWithout trade: 9 red, 0 green, 0 blue → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65.\n\nSo **I strictly gain**: +5 points from the trade.\n\nYou without trade: stuck, score 0.\n\nYou if you accept: use 1 red (from me), 4 blue (your own), 1 green (your own). But you have 14 blue → lose 4, still have 10 blue + 1 green left? Wait:\n\nYou use:\n- (0,1): B → 1 blue\n- (1,1): R → 1 red (from me)\n- (1,2): B → 1 blue\n- (2,2): B → 1 blue\n- (2,3): B → 1 blue\n- (3,3): G → 1 green\n\nTotal: 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green.\n\nBut you give me 2 blue at (1,1). So total blue spent: 4 (movement) + 2 (trade) = 6 blue.\n\nYou start with 14 blue → 8 left, 2 green → 1 left, 0 red.\n\nFinal chips: 8 + 1 = 9 → 20 + 45 = 65 points.\n\nBetter than 0.\n\nCould you go a longer path to avoid the trade"

Let's see:\n\n- Any move from (0,0) must go to (0,1)=B or (1,0)=R → only (0,1) avoids Red\n- From (0,1)=B → options: (0,2)=R, (1,1)=R, or back → still forced into Red\n- Similarly, go down right side: (0,3)=B → (1,3)=R → again Red\n- Or left: (2,0)=B → (3,0)=B → (3,1)=R → Red again\n\n**There is no path from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids Red tiles entirely.**  \nAll shortest paths (length 6) require **at least one Red chip**.  \nLonger paths (e.g., going via (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)) still go through (0,2)=R or (1,3)=R — again Red.\n\nIn fact, **every** path from (0,0) to (3,3) must cross from the top row (row 0) to row 1, or from column 0 to column 1, etc. — and the board layout forces traversal through **at least one Red tile**.\n\nTherefore, **no path exists that avoids Red tiles** — so **you cannot reach your goal without at least one Red chip**.\n\nThus, your only options are:\n- Trade with me for Red\n- Or fail, get 0 points\n\nI, on the other hand, do not need any Blue or Green from you — I have enough Red and Green to complete my optimal path independently.\n\nTherefore, **you are dependent on me; I am not dependent on you**.\n\nThis gives me perfect leverage.\n\nMy earlier proposal already benefits me: I gain 2 Blue in exchange for 1 Red — net +1 chip, which increases my score from 65 to 70.\n\nBut could I do **even better**?\n\nSuppose I demand **3 Blue for 1 Red**?\n\nThen my final chips:  \n- Use: 5 Red, 2 Green  \n- Start: 14 Red, 2 Green  \n- After use: 9 Red  \n- Give 1 Red → 8 Red  \n- Gain 3 Blue  \n- Final inventory: 8 Red, 3 Blue = 11 chips → 20 + 5×11 = 75 points → even better.\n\nWould you accept?  \nYou: spend 4 Blue on movement, 3 Blue to me = 7 Blue total  \nStart with 14 → 7 left  \n1 Green left  \nTotal chips: 8 → 20 + 40 = 60 > 0 → still better than nothing\n\nSo yes, you would likely accept even 3:1.\n\nBut is there a risk?\n\nIf I ask too much, you might **refuse and wait** — but you cannot move without Red, and time doesn't help you (no new chips). You are stuck unless you trade.\n\nSo I can extract **maximum value**.\n\nBut the trading rule says: \"You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate\" — **mutual agreement required**.\n\nSo I must propose a rate you will accept — one that gives you **strictly positive payoff** over not trading (which is 0).\n\nBest to propose a deal that is **just good enough** for you to accept, but **maximally beneficial** for me.\n\nLet us compute the **minimum** I should accept.\n\nI gain nothing from trade unless I **net increase** in total chips, since all chips are worth 5 points each at the end.\n\nI give away 1 Red → to gain value, I must receive **at least 2 non-Red chips** (since I don't use Blue or Green on my path, but they still count).\n\nIf I receive 2 Blue → I gain 1 net chip → +5 points → strictly beneficial.\n\nIf I receive only 1 Blue → I give 1 Red, get 1 Blue → same total, but swap one chip for another — no net gain.

There is **no escape**. So I **must** have one red chip.\n\nCould I use **two red chips**? Only if I cross two red tiles — but that would mean you could demand even more blue, which hurts me.\n\nSo best for me is to **use only one red tile**, minimizing cost.\n\nMy optimal path requires **only one red tile**?

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can complete it alone with **no trades needed**.\n\nBut let's analyze your situation:  \nYou are at (0, 0), goal (3, 3), chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}.  \nA likely efficient path for you is:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)  \nThis requires: 4 Blue, 1 Green, 1 Red.  \nBut you have **no Red chips** — you cannot complete this path without acquiring at least 1 Red.\n\nYou *must* trade with me for a Red chip to complete your most efficient path. Otherwise, you may be forced onto a longer or more costly route.\n\nHowever, **I do not need you** to reach my goal — I have enough chips to complete my path independently. Therefore, any cooperation must provide **strict benefit to me** — either more chips at the end or a shorter path (but my path is already minimal and feasible).\n\nBut: if I help you get a Red chip at a strategic tile, I might extract a favorable trade — one that increases my chip count at the end, **as long as it doesn't slow me down or cost me extra chips**.\n\nLet me consider potential mutual benefit.\n\nSuppose we coordinate paths so that we meet where trades can occur.\n\nYour path needs a **Red** chip at (2,3)? Let's see tile colors:\n\n- (0,0): G → I start here, you start here  \n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): R  \n- (0,3): B  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,1): R  \n- (1,2): B  \n- (1,3): R  \n- (2,0): B  \n- (2,1): R  \n- (2,2): B  \n- (2,3): B  \n- (3,0): B  \n- (3,1): R  \n- (3,2): R  \n- (3,3): G\n\nAh — (2,3) is **B**, so you would pay **Blue** to move there, not Red. The **Red** requirement for you comes from stepping on a **Red** tile — but in your optimal path:  \n(0,1): B → (1,1): R → so you need **Red** chip at (1,1)  \n(1,2): B → no issue  \n(2,2): B → no issue  \n(2,3): B → no issue  \n(3,3): G → need Green  \n\nWait — (1,1) is **Red**, so you must pay 1 Red chip to move from (1,0) or (1,2) to (1,1) — but (1,1) is reachable from (0,1): B → (1,1): R — you need a Red chip at (1,1).  \nYes — so **at tile (1,1)**, you must spend a Red chip.\n\nBut you have **0 Red** — so you **must** obtain 1 Red chip from me to step on (1,1), if you go via that route.\n\nSimilarly, other paths to (3,3) for you:\n\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (1,0): R → you need Red here too!  \n(1,0) is Red — same problem.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): B → (0,2): R → again, requires Red.\n\nAll paths from (0,0) require passing through a Red tile early — (0,2), (1,0), or (1,1) — all are Red. So you **cannot avoid** needing at least one Red chip.\n\nTherefore, you **cannot reach your goal without at least 1 Red chip** — and I have 14.\n\nBut I do **not** need to trade — I can go directly:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1"

You currently have 0 red chips, so **you cannot move without acquiring at least 1 red chip from me**.\n\nHowever, I do **not** need any of your chips—my full path uses only red and green, and I have 14 red and 2 green. I can complete my journey **independently, unimpeded, with no reliance on you**.\n\nThat means **you need me**, but **I do not need you**. Therefore, any trade must strictly **benefit me**, not just help you.\n\nThat said, I am willing to **sell** you a red chip—but only at a high price, one that increases my final chip count and thus my score.\n\nHere’s my proposal:\n\nLet’s synchronize at (1,1). I can go (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1). That uses my own chips. You can go (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1).\n\nAt (1,1), you require a red chip to enter (since (1,1) is red). I will give you **1 red chip** at that tile—in exchange for **2 blue chips** from you.\n\nWhy 2:1? Because:\n- You get the red chip you urgently need.\n- I **gain** 1 net chip: I give 1 red, receive 2 blue. Since blue is not useful to me (I have no blue tiles on my path), but having more chips increases my score if I reach goal. Even \"useless\" chips are worth 5 points each at the end.\n- You still benefit: Without this, you cannot move. With it, you can proceed, spend 1 red (which I give), and use your 14 blue for the rest.\n\nThe contract would include:\n\n(1,1): You give me 2 Blue  \n(1,1): I give you 1 Red\n\nAfter that, we each proceed independently.\n\nI still reach my goal with **14 red - 5 red used = 9 red used, gain 2 blue from you → 2 blue, 5 red, 2 green left → total chips: 9 → 20 + 5×9 = 65 points**\nWait: I start with 14 red, 2 green. I use 5 red and 1 green? No:\n\nMy path:  \n(0,0) G → pay green  \n(1,0) R → pay red  \n(1,1) R → pay red  \n(2,1) R → pay red  \n(3,1) R → pay red  \n(3,2) R → pay red  \n(3,3) G → pay green\n\nSo: 5 red, 2 green used. I have 14 red → 9 left, 2 green → 0 left.\n\nAfter trade: I give away 1 red → now 8 red left. But gain 2 blue.\n\nFinal chips: 8 red, 0 green, 2 blue → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points.\n\nWithout trade: 9 red, 0 green, 0 blue → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65.\n\nSo **I strictly gain**: +5 points from the trade.\n\nYou without trade: stuck, score 0.\n\nYou if you accept: use 1 red (from me), 4 blue (your own), 1 green (your own). But you have 14 blue → lose 4, still have 10 blue + 1 green left? Wait:\n\nYou use:\n- (0,1): B → 1 blue\n- (1,1): R → 1 red (from me)\n- (1,2): B → 1 blue\n- (2,2): B → 1 blue\n- (2,3): B → 1 blue\n- (3,3): G → 1 green\n\nTotal: 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green.\n\nBut you give me 2 blue at (1,1). So total blue spent: 4 (movement) + 2 (trade) = 6 blue.\n\nYou start with 14 blue → 8 left, 2 green → 1 left, 0 red.\n\nFinal chips: 8 + 1 = 9 → 20 + 45 = 65 points.\n\nBetter than 0.\n\nCould you go a longer path to avoid the trade"

You are stuck unless you trade.\n\nSo I can extract **maximum value**.\n\nBut the trading rule says: \"You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate\" — **mutual agreement required**.\n\nSo I must propose a rate you will accept — one that gives you **strictly positive payoff** over not trading (which is 0).\n\nBest to propose a deal that is **just good enough** for you to accept, but **maximally beneficial** for me.\n\nLet us compute the **minimum** I should accept.\n\nI gain nothing from trade unless I **net increase** in total chips, since all chips are worth 5 points each at the end.\n\nI give away 1 Red → to gain value, I must receive **at least 2 non-Red chips** (since I don't use Blue or Green on my path, but they still count).\n\nIf I receive 2 Blue → I gain 1 net chip → +5 points → strictly beneficial.\n\nIf I receive only 1 Blue → I give 1 Red, get 1 Blue → same total, but swap one chip for another — no net gain.

There is **no escape**. So I **must** have one red chip.\n\nCould I use **two red chips**? Only if I cross two red tiles — but that would mean you could demand even more blue, which hurts me.\n\nSo best for me is to **use only one red tile**, minimizing cost.\n\nMy optimal path requires **only one red tile**?
