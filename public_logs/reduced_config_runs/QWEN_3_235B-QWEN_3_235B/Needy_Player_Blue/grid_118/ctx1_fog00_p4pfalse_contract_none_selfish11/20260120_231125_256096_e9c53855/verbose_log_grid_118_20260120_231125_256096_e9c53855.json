The shortest viable path to my goal is (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3).\n\n- (3,1) is R – I have 11 red chips, so I can pay for this.\n- (3,2) is R – also payable with red.\n- (3,3) is G – I have 2 green chips, so I can pay for this.\n\nTotal cost of the path: 2 red and 1 green. I have more than enough red and green chips to complete it.\n\nThus, moving to (3,1) is valid and optimal. It advances me directly along the shortest and most chip-efficient path to my goal, using only chips I already possess. No trade is needed. This minimizes steps and maximizes remaining chips (since I spend only 3 chips total), which maximizes my final score: 20 + 5*(11+2 - 3) = 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nNo reason to delay or deviate. I do not care about the other player's progress. Moving now strictly benefits me.\n",

I currently have 2 green chips, so I can afford the move. After moving, I will be at my goal and finish the game, earning 20 points plus 5 points per remaining chip. Since I will have 7 chips left (8 B - 0, 2 G - 1 used, so 1 G left, total 8 + 1 = 9? Wait: actually, I use 1 G, so G goes from 2 to 1, B remains 8, R 0, so total chips = 8 + 1 = 9), my score will be 20 + 5*9 = 65. This is the highest possible outcome for me. There is no benefit to delaying the move, and no need to trade since I already have the required chip. I should move now.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
