But since I can afford to move on a B tile and there is a viable B-path toward the goal — (0,1)->(0,2)->(0,3)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(3,3) — which requires 3 B and 2 R and 1 G, but I still lack R, so same issue. However, (1,1) is R, which I can't pay. So no progress possible without R. Best option: stay and attempt to negotiate R coverage. But wait — the game allows pay-for-other mode. I should propose a trade to cover 1 R move for me in exchange for covering 1 G or B for them. But for now, no agreement exists. Therefore, I cannot make any forward progress toward the goal unless I use R. So I must stay. But actually, (0,1) to (0,2) is B — I can pay that. It doesn't help much but keeps options open. However, it does not bring me closer to goal in optimal path. But it is a horizontal move on B. But goal is down and right. (0,2) gets me closer column-wise. From (0,2), next could be (0,3), then (1,3) which is R — again blocked. So still need R. So moving on B tiles doesn't solve the R bottleneck. I still need a trade for R. So better to stay at (0,1) and initiate negotiation. Therefore, I choose not to move.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
