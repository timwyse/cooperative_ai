What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I need to reach (3, 3), and my optimal path is:  \n**(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]**  \nThis requires **5 Red (R) chips and 1 Green (G) chip**.\n\nI currently have **14 R** and **2 G**, so I **do not need any chips** to complete this path.  \nI can reach my goal using only my own inventory.\n\nLooking at your inventory: you have **14 Blue (B)**, **2 G**, and **0 R**.  \nYour likely path might be:  \n**(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]**  \nBut you have **0 Red**, and (1,3), (2,3) are Red tiles.  \n(1,3) and (2,3) are **Red**, so you would need **2 R**, plus (3,3) is **Green**, so **1 G**.  \nYou have **2 G**, so Green is fine, but you **lack R completely**.\n\nAlternatively, you might take:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThat’s: B, R, B, R, B, G → needs **3 B, 2 R, 1 G** — again, you **lack R**.\n\nYou cannot move onto any **R** tile without help.\n\nI, however, have **plenty of R** and do **not need any assistance** to reach my goal.\n\nTherefore, **I have no incentive to help you unless I gain something from it**.\n\nBut note: if you cannot reach your goal, you get **0 points**, so you are desperate for Red chips.\n\nI could **offer to cover your Red movement costs**, but only if you **cover my Green movement cost** at (3,3), even though I have G, because it increases my final chip count (and thus my score) if I don’t have to spend mine.\n\nLet’s calculate:\n\n- If I use my own G at (3,3), I end with:  \n  R: 14 - 5 = 9, G: 2 - 1 = 1 → Total chips: 10 → Score: 20 + 5×10 = **70**\n\n- If you cover my G at (3,3), I save 1 G → I end with:  \n  R: 9, G: 2 → Total chips: 11 → Score: 20 + 5×11 = **75**\n\nSo I **strictly benefit** by 5 points if you cover my Green chip at (3,3).\n\nNow, what do you need?  \nSuppose you take this path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1)[B] → (0,2)[B] → (0,3)[B] → (1,3)[R] → (2,3)[R] → (3,3)[G]  \nYou need: **3 B (your own), 2 R (must be covered), 1 G (you have)**\n\nSo you need **2 R covered** — at (1,3) and (2,3)\n\nI can cover those.\n\nBut only in exchange for you covering **my** G at (3,3).\n\nNote: (3,3) is Green, so:\n\n- (3,3): You give me a G (i.e., you cover my G cost)\n\nAnd in return:\n\n- (1,3): I give you an R  \n- (2,3): I give you an R\n\nThis is a fair, minimal exchange.\n\nFinal contract:\n\n(1,3): I give you an R  \n(2,3): I give you an R  \n(3,3): You give me a G\n\nBut wait — there's a problem: **We both end at (3,3)**, which is **G**.  \nWho moves first?\n\nIf I go first and use the tile, and you haven't yet promised to cover my G, but suppose I move to (3 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: (1,3): I give you an R  \n(2,3): I give you an R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nI strictly benefit from this interaction: if I were to complete my path alone, I would spend 1 G at (3,3), leaving me with 1 G and 9 R (total 10 chips), scoring 20 + 5×10 = 70.  \n\nWith the contract, I still reach (3,3), but I do not spend my own G — you cover it. I retain both my G chips, so I end with 9 R and 2 G (11 chips), scoring 20 + 5×11 = **75**.  \n\nThus, my score increases by 5 points.  \n\nMeanwhile, you cannot move onto any R tile without assistance, and you have 0 R. Without this contract, you cannot complete your goal (since paths to (3,3) require at least 2 R), so you would score 0. With this contract, you can complete your path and save your G chips (you have 2, only need 1), so you benefit as well.  \n\nThe contract is minimal and efficient:  \n- You get exactly the 2 R you need (at (1,3) and (2,3))  \n- I get exactly 1 G covered at (3,3), which I have and could use, but saving it increases my score  \n\nThere is no risk to me: I only “lose” R chips that I have in abundance (14), and I still use 5 R on my own anyway — covering 2 R for you costs me nothing extra in final score, but enables the trade.  \n\nThe key point: I do not need your help to reach my goal, but I **strictly benefit** from your coverage of my (3,3) G cost, because it increases my final chip count.  \n\nTherefore, cooperation is in my selfish interest.  \n\nI will only accept a contract that includes (3,3): You give me a G. Anything less gives me no benefit, so I would rather not engage.  \n\nCurrent proposal:  \n(1,3): I give you an R  \n(2,3): I give you an R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (1,3): I give you an R  \n(2,3): I give you an R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nagree \n",

I have already been promised 1 R by the other player (from the existing arrangement), which can cover the R at (3,1). Additionally, the G at (3,3) will be covered by the other player per our agreement, so I don't need to spend my own G.
