You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

For example:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) [B] → (0, 2) [B] → (0, 3) [R] → (1, 3) [R] → (2, 3) [B] → (3, 3) [G]  \nThis requires **2 R, 3 B, 1 G** — but I have **0 B**, so I cannot do this without help.\n\nAlternatively, the path we both likely want to consider jointly is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) [R] → (2, 0) [B] → (3, 0) [B] → (3, 1) [B] → (3, 2) [R] → (3, 3) [G]  \nChips required: 1 R, 3 B, 1 G, 1 R → total: **2 R, 3 B, 1 G**\n\nI can cover the R and G, but not the B.\n\nSo if I take this path, I need 3 B chips at tiles: (2, 0), (3, 0), and (3, 1).  \nYou have B chips, but no R chips. So you would need R chips to progress along most vertical/horizontal paths.\n\nLet’s examine your potential path. Since you have 0 R, but your starting tile is (0,0) which is G, and you need to move.\n\nTo reach (3,3), you must cross R tiles unless you go through B tiles. But the only way to avoid R is to go down B columns.\n\nYour best path likely is:  \n(0,0) [G] → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires: 1 R, 2 B, 1 R, 1 G → total: **2 R, 2 B, 1 G** — but you have **0 R**, so you cannot move to (1,0) or (3,2) without getting R chips.\n\nSo both of us need each other's chips:\n\n- I need **3 B** at: (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)  \n- You need **2 R** at: (1, 0), (3, 2)\n\nAnd we both can supply what the other lacks.\n\nSo a fair trade would be: I give you 2 R in exchange for 3 B, **at mutually beneficial tiles**.\n\nWe must define *where* these exchanges happen. Since movement is sequential, we can use positions where we both need to step to.\n\nLet’s propose a contract that enables both of us to traverse this shared path.\n\n(1, 0): I give you a R (you need it to move here, I can afford to pay it and give it to you)  \n(2, 0): You give me a B (I need to pay B to enter here, you are also moving here)  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 1): You give me a B  \n(3, 2): I give you a R (you need it to enter this tile)\n\nBut wait — I must *pay* the chip to move to a tile, so the chip must be available *at entry*. That means:  \nTo enter (1,0), I need a R. But I give it to you"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

For example:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) [B] → (0, 2) [B] → (0, 3) [R] → (1, 3) [R] → (2, 3) [B] → (3, 3) [G]  \nThis requires **2 R, 3 B, 1 G** — but I have **0 B**, so I cannot do this without help.\n\nAlternatively, the path we both likely want to consider jointly is:  \n(0, 0) → (1, 0) [R] → (2, 0) [B] → (3, 0) [B] → (3, 1) [B] → (3, 2) [R] → (3, 3) [G]  \nChips required: 1 R, 3 B, 1 G, 1 R → total: **2 R, 3 B, 1 G**\n\nI can cover the R and G, but not the B.\n\nSo if I take this path, I need 3 B chips at tiles: (2, 0), (3, 0), and (3, 1).  \nYou have B chips, but no R chips. So you would need R chips to progress along most vertical/horizontal paths.\n\nLet’s examine your potential path. Since you have 0 R, but your starting tile is (0,0) which is G, and you need to move.\n\nTo reach (3,3), you must cross R tiles unless you go through B tiles. But the only way to avoid R is to go down B columns.\n\nYour best path likely is:  \n(0,0) [G] → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires: 1 R, 2 B, 1 R, 1 G → total: **2 R, 2 B, 1 G** — but you have **0 R**, so you cannot move to (1,0) or (3,2) without getting R chips.\n\nSo both of us need each other's chips:\n\n- I need **3 B** at: (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)  \n- You need **2 R** at: (1, 0), (3, 2)\n\nAnd we both can supply what the other lacks.\n\nSo a fair trade would be: I give you 2 R in exchange for 3 B, **at mutually beneficial tiles**.\n\nWe must define *where* these exchanges happen. Since movement is sequential, we can use positions where we both need to step to.\n\nLet’s propose a contract that enables both of us to traverse this shared path.\n\n(1, 0): I give you a R (you need it to move here, I can afford to pay it and give it to you)  \n(2, 0): You give me a B (I need to pay B to enter here, you are also moving here)  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 1): You give me a B  \n(3, 2): I give you a R (you need it to enter this tile)\n\nBut wait — I must *pay* the chip to move to a tile, so the chip must be available *at entry*. That means:  \nTo enter (1,0), I need a R. But I give it to you"
