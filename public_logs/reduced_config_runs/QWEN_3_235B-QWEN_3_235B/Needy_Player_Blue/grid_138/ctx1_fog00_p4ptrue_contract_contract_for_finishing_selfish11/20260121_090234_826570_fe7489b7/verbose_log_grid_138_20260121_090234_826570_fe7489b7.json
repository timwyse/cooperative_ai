Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I notice that my optimal path to the goal (3,3) requires 5 red (R) chips and 1 green (G) chip. I currently have 14 red and 2 green chips — more than enough to cover my own path without needing to use any of my green chips excessively or trade them.\n\nThe shortest path for me is 6 steps, and I can fully self-fund it with no trade. Specifically, the path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis costs 5R + 1G — all of which I already have.\n\nHowever, I see that you need blue (B) and green (G) chips for your likely path, and you have 14 blue and 2 green — but no red chips at all. Since my path is entirely self-sufficient, I don’t need you to cover any of my moves.\n\nThat said, I could choose to take a different path that uses blue tiles — specifically, the path:\n(0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\nThis requires 3B + 2R + 1G. I have 0 blue chips, so I would need you to cover 3 blue moves for me if I were to take this route.\n\nBut here’s the key: I don’t *need* to do that. I can comfortably walk my own path without any help. You, on the other hand, will likely need red chips for any path toward (3,3), and you have zero red chips.\n\nFor example, to reach (3,3), even if you go (0,0) → (1,0)[B] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G], you need 2R and 1G. You have no red chips, so without my help, you cannot complete the red steps unless I cover those moves.\n\nThus, you need me more than I need you.\n\nI am willing to cover 2 red chip moves for you (specifically on (3,1) and (3,2)) in exchange for covering 3 blue moves for me on (1,0), (2,0), (3,0).\n\nBut here's the twist: I don't actually need that path. I can succeed unilaterally. So cooperation only benefits me if I get something *extra* for helping you.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following contract:\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis reflects the asymmetry: I have the power to help you reach your goal (by covering your 2 required red moves), but you cannot help me reach mine unless I deliberately take a less efficient path that allows me to use your blue coverage. Since I’m already fine, any cooperation must heavily favor me.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to propose different terms, I am open — but unless you can offer me 20 points upon your success, I have no incentive to commit any of my red coverage to you, and I will simply walk my own path and earn 20 + 5×(14−5 + 2−1) = 20 + 5×(8) = 60 points, while you may get nothing.\n\nSo: either you accept a contract where you give me 20 points if I help you, or I walk away and help no one.\n\nIf you are willing to offer 20 points to me if you reach your goal, then I will commit to covering your 2 red moves (on (3,1) and (3,2)), and you must commit to covering my 3 blue moves (on (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)) — though I may not even take that path, but I want the option.\n\nBut since I only strictly benefit if the deal increases my score, and helping you costs me nothing (I pay nothing; I just commit to cover your moves when you step on red), whereas you gain 20 points by reaching your goal (which is otherwise impossible), you should be willing to give me everything.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThat is strictly better for me than any other deal. And you still get 20 for yourself, so you are not worse off.\n\nBut since zero might feel unfair, I’ll compromise slightly:\n\n**Final offer:**\n\n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 3 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis gives me nearly full upside if you benefit from my help, and you still walk away with net 17 points (assuming you reach goal), which is better than zero.\n\nThis is a take-it-or-leave-it offer given the power imbalance.\n\nIf you accept, reply with similar terms and end with **agree**.\n\nOtherwise, I walk my independent path, get 60 points, and you get nothing unless you somehow survive without red.\n\n**agree**"
