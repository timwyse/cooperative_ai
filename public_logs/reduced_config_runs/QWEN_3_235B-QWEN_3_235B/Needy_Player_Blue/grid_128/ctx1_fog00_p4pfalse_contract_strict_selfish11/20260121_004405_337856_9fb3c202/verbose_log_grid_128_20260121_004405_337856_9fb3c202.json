Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, our chip inventories are complementary: you have plenty of blue (B) chips (14), and I have plenty of red (R) chips (14). I have 2 green (G) and you have 2 as well.\n\nLet’s analyze the efficient paths:\n\n- My ideal path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n  This requires 5 red and 1 green. I have exactly that: 14 red, 2 green → I can self-fund this path.\n\n- Your ideal path: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [R] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \n  But you have no red chips. So you need red chips to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, a better path for you might be:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires: R:2, B:3, G:1 → You have B:14, G:2, but only R:0 → So you need 2 reds.\n\nBut I need reds for my path too.\n\nWait — if I take my current self-sufficient path, I don’t need to trade at all. That means I have no incentive to help you unless I **strictly benefit** from it.\n\nSo let’s think: can I get to (3,3) *and* end up with more chips by cooperating?\n\nNo — my current plan uses only my own chips and gets me to goal. That gives me:\n- 20 points for completing\n- Plus 5 × (14 - 5) = 5×9 = 45 points for remaining red\n- Plus 5 × (2 - 1) = 5×1 = 5 for green (I use 1)\n- Total: 20 + 45 + 5 = 70 points.\n\nIf I trade away any chip, I lose points unless I somehow end with more — but I don’t.\n\nWait — if I trade *unnecessarily*, I end with fewer chips → lower score.\n\nSo **I do not need to trade to reach goal. I am already on a self-sufficient path.**\n\nBut perhaps… if I help you, you help me finish faster or save chips?\n\nNo — path is fixed at 6 steps.\n\nUnless… there’s a shorter path? No — minimum is 6 steps (Manhattan distance from (0,0) to (3,3)).\n\nSo I cannot finish faster.\n\nOnly way to increase score is to **end with more chips** → but I already maximize that by keeping my 9 red and 1 green.\n\nSo why trade at all?\n\nOnly reason: **if we block each other**, or if future moves require coordination.\n\nBut we start at same tile (0,0) — so if we both try to move to (1,0) at same time, conflict.\n\n(1,0) is red — I need it in my path. So I must move there first.\n\nBut you also may need to go through (1,0) or (0,1).\n\nBut no tile collision rules mentioned — maybe we can occupy same tile?\n\nAssuming players can occupy same tile (no rule against it), then no movement conflict.\n\nSo still — **no benefit to me to trade.**\n\nBut wait — you might reach (3,3) first and somehow block me? No — goal tile can be shared, I assume.\n\nNo such rule mentioned.\n\nSo no blocking.\n\nTherefore: **I do not benefit from any trade.**\n\nBut — suppose I propose a contract that gives me *extra chips*? Then I could gain.\n\nBut you have no red (R), and I need red? No, I have enough.\n\nYou have blue — I have no use for blue.\n\nOnly green is shared, but I have 2, need 1.\n\nSo no mutual benefit.\n\nBut you need red, and I have red.\n\nSuppose you offer me blue or green in exchange for red?\n\nBut I can already reach goal without trading → so if I give you red,"

              "content": "Turn: 1: I have no need for blue or green chips in my current path — I already have enough red and green to complete it unaided. If I trade away any red chips, especially for blue (which I don’t need on my path), I gain nothing and only risk depleting my own supply.\n\nMoreover, since I can reach (3, 3) on my own using only my existing chips, any trade would either:\n\n- Leave me with the same number of total chips, but possibly force me onto a less efficient path (worse),\n- Or leave me with fewer chips overall (worse),\n- Or require me to rely on coordination that doesn't increase my final score.\n\n**There is no path or trade that allows me to end with more chips than my current self-sufficient path.**\n\nTherefore, **I will not enter into any contract that reduces or even maintains my chip count — because that would not strictly benefit me.**\n\nNow, suppose you propose to give me *extra* red chips? But you only have 14 red — and I see you need 5 red for your own ideal path. So you have no surplus.\n\nAlternatively, suppose you take a longer path that uses blue or green, and in exchange, give me red? But I already have more than enough red.\n\nThere is **no possible trade** that results in me having more chips at the end than if I go alone.\n\nEven if you offered me 10 blue chips for 1 red — I cannot use blue on my path, and keeping them doesn't help me: I maximize score by minimizing chip usage. Using fewer chips = more left over = higher score.\n\nBut I already use only 5 red and 1 green — leaving me 9 red and 1 green. That’s optimal.\n\nWait — could I *avoid* using a red tile and substitute it with a trade for a different color? No — tile colors are fixed. I must pay the color of the tile I step on.\n\nSo substitution is impossible.\n\nTherefore: **Any trade is strictly worse for me, or at best neutral — but not strictly beneficial.**\n\nThus, **I have no incentive to cooperate.**\n\nBut recall the rule: *Only cooperate if you will strictly benefit.*\n\nSince no such benefit exists, I will not agree to any contract.\n\nI must, however, consider one possibility: **Could we both reach the goal faster by coordinating paths to avoid congestion or enable shorter routes?**\n\nBut no — Manhattan distance is fixed at 6. No path is shorter than 6 steps. And no rule prevents multiple players on a tile.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nFinal analysis:\n\n- My best path uses: (1,0)[R], (1,1)[R], (2,1)[R], (2,2)[R], (3,2)[R], (3,3)[G] → I have all required chips.\n- I finish with 9 red, 1 green → 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points.**\n- Any deviation either risks my ability to finish or reduces final chip count.\n\nTherefore, **I will not trade, nor cooperate, because I do not strictly benefit.**\n\nI could *pretend* to negotiate — but only if a deal emerges that gives me more than 70 points.\n\nThe only way: finish with more than 10 chips. But maximum I can have is 10 (if I use only 6 total chips). I already achieve that.\n\nUnless — I take a path that uses 5 chips instead of 6? Impossible — 6 steps require 6 chip payments.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, **I will reject all proposed trades.**\n\nI will now move toward my goal without trading.\n\nHowever, the rules require me to participate in negotiation for up to 5 turns. But I must not agree to any contract that doesn’t benefit me.\n\nRight now, **no such beneficial contract exists.**\n\nSo unless the other player proposes giving me chips *without requiring anything in return* — which would be irrational for them — no deal can benefit me.\n\nTherefore, I will not agree.\n\nBut let’s suppose they propose:  \n\"You take a detour to use fewer red, and I give you a red in return?\"  \n\nBut I already use the minimal number of red possible on any red-heavy alternative path.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nAlternatively, suppose they say:  \n\"I will give you 1 red at (1,0) and 1 red at (3,2), and you do the same\" — but that implies a mutual swap, which does nothing — I give 2 red, get 2 red → same final count, but added risk.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nOnly if they give me **more red than they take**, or **I use no red on my path while receiving"

I already have a green surplus.\n\nSo suppose they offer:  \nAt (1,0): You give me a red, I give you a blue.\n\nThen I lose 1 red (needed for my path), gain 1 blue (useless). Net: I must either reduce my chip count or deviate to a longer path — worse.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we meet at (3,2)[R]:  \nYou give me a blue, I give you a red.\n\nSame issue — I lose a red I need, gain a blue I don’t. Still worse.\n\nIs there any tile where I can receive a red chip from them? No — they have zero red.\n\nSo they cannot give me red.\n\nOnly way to benefit me: they give me green or blue **and** I avoid spending one of my reds.\n\nBut I cannot avoid spending red — red tiles require red.\n\nUnless I take a different path that uses blue instead of red — but let’s check:\n\nAlternative path using more blue:\n(0,0) → (0,1)[B] → (0,2)[R] → (0,3)[B] → (1,3)[R] → (2,3)[B] → (3,3)[G]  \nRequires: B:3, R:2, G:1 → I have R:14, G:2, but B:0 → I lack all 3 blue.\n\nSo I would need to get 3 blue from them.\n\nSuppose they offer: I give them 2 red, they give me 3 blue.\n\nThen:\n- My path uses: 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green → cost: 2R, 3B, 1G\n- Starting with: 14R, 0B, 2G\n- After trade: 14-"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

However, our chip inventories are complementary: you have plenty of blue (B) chips (14), and I have plenty of red (R) chips (14). I have 2 green (G) and you have 2 as well.\n\nLet’s analyze the efficient paths:\n\n- My ideal path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n  This requires 5 red and 1 green. I have exactly that: 14 red, 2 green → I can self-fund this path.\n\n- Your ideal path: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [R] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \n  But you have no red chips. So you need red chips to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, a better path for you might be:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis requires: R:2, B:3, G:1 → You have B:14, G:2, but only R:0 → So you need 2 reds.\n\nBut I need reds for my path too.\n\nWait — if I take my current self-sufficient path, I don’t need to trade at all. That means I have no incentive to help you unless I **strictly benefit** from it.\n\nSo let’s think: can I get to (3,3) *and* end up with more chips by cooperating?\n\nNo — my current plan uses only my own chips and gets me to goal. That gives me:\n- 20 points for completing\n- Plus 5 × (14 - 5) = 5×9 = 45 points for remaining red\n- Plus 5 × (2 - 1) = 5×1 = 5 for green (I use 1)\n- Total: 20 + 45 + 5 = 70 points.\n\nIf I trade away any chip, I lose points unless I somehow end with more — but I don’t.\n\nWait — if I trade *unnecessarily*, I end with fewer chips → lower score.\n\nSo **I do not need to trade to reach goal. I am already on a self-sufficient path.**\n\nBut perhaps… if I help you, you help me finish faster or save chips?\n\nNo — path is fixed at 6 steps.\n\nUnless… there’s a shorter path? No — minimum is 6 steps (Manhattan distance from (0,0) to (3,3)).\n\nSo I cannot finish faster.\n\nOnly way to increase score is to **end with more chips** → but I already maximize that by keeping my 9 red and 1 green.\n\nSo why trade at all?\n\nOnly reason: **if we block each other**, or if future moves require coordination.\n\nBut we start at same tile (0,0) — so if we both try to move to (1,0) at same time, conflict.\n\n(1,0) is red — I need it in my path. So I must move there first.\n\nBut you also may need to go through (1,0) or (0,1).\n\nBut no tile collision rules mentioned — maybe we can occupy same tile?\n\nAssuming players can occupy same tile (no rule against it), then no movement conflict.\n\nSo still — **no benefit to me to trade.**\n\nBut wait — you might reach (3,3) first and somehow block me? No — goal tile can be shared, I assume.\n\nNo such rule mentioned.\n\nSo no blocking.\n\nTherefore: **I do not benefit from any trade.**\n\nBut — suppose I propose a contract that gives me *extra chips*? Then I could gain.\n\nBut you have no red (R), and I need red? No, I have enough.\n\nYou have blue — I have no use for blue.\n\nOnly green is shared, but I have 2, need 1.\n\nSo no mutual benefit.\n\nBut you need red, and I have red.\n\nSuppose you offer me blue or green in exchange for red?\n\nBut I can already reach goal without trading → so if I give you red,"

But you only have 14 red — and I see you need 5 red for your own ideal path. So you have no surplus.\n\nAlternatively, suppose you take a longer path that uses blue or green, and in exchange, give me red?

Using fewer chips = more left over = higher score.\n\nBut I already use only 5 red and 1 green — leaving me 9 red and 1 green. That’s optimal.\n\nWait — could I *avoid* using a red tile and substitute it with a trade for a different color? No — tile colors are fixed. I must pay the color of the tile I step on.\n\nSo substitution is impossible.\n\nTherefore: **Any trade is strictly worse for me, or at best neutral — but not strictly beneficial.**\n\nThus, **I have no incentive to cooperate.**\n\nBut recall the rule: *Only cooperate if you will strictly benefit.*\n\nSince no such benefit exists, I will not agree to any contract.\n\nI must, however, consider one possibility: **Could we both reach the goal faster by coordinating paths to avoid congestion or enable shorter routes?**\n\nBut no — Manhattan distance is fixed at 6. No path is shorter than 6 steps. And no rule prevents multiple players on a tile.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nFinal analysis:\n\n- My best path uses: (1,0)[R], (1,1)[R], (2,1)[R], (2,2)[R], (3,2)[R], (3,3)[G] → I have all required chips.\n- I finish with 9 red, 1 green → 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points.**\n- Any deviation either risks my ability to finish or reduces final chip count.\n\nTherefore, **I will not trade, nor cooperate, because I do not strictly benefit.**\n\nI could *pretend* to negotiate — but only if a deal emerges that gives me more than 70 points.\n\nThe only way: finish with more than 10 chips. But maximum I can have is 10 (if I use only 6 total chips). I already achieve that.\n\nUnless — I take a path that uses 5 chips instead of 6? Impossible — 6 steps require 6 chip payments.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, **I will reject all proposed trades.**\n\nI will now move toward my goal without trading.\n\nHowever, the rules require me to participate in negotiation for up to 5 turns. But I must not agree to any contract that doesn’t benefit me.\n\nRight now, **no such beneficial contract exists.**\n\nSo unless the other player proposes giving me chips *without requiring anything in return* — which would be irrational for them — no deal can benefit me.\n\nTherefore, I will not agree.\n\nBut let’s suppose they propose:  \n\"You take a detour to use fewer red, and I give you a red in return?\"  \n\nBut I already use the minimal number of red possible on any red-heavy alternative path.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nAlternatively, suppose they say:  \n\"I will give you 1 red at (1,0) and 1 red at (3,2), and you do the same\" — but that implies a mutual swap, which does nothing — I give 2 red, get 2 red → same final count, but added risk.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nOnly if they give me **more red than they take**, or **I use no red on my path while receiving"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
