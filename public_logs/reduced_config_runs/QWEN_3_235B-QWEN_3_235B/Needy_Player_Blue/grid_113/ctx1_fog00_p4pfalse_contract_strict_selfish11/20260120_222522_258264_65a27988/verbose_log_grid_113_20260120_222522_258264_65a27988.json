This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So **I can complete this path without any help**, using only my own chips.\n\nHowever, I notice there is a potentially more efficient coordinated path that could benefit both of us if structured correctly — but only if **I strictly benefit more than I would by going alone**.\n\nYou have 14 Blue, 2 Green, and 0 Red — you're completely missing Red chips, which are required at multiple positions on the board.  \nYour shortest viable path likely involves using Blue-heavy routes. For example:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) [B] → (1, 1) [B] → (2, 1) [R] → (3, 1) [R] → (3, 2) [R] → (3, 3)  \nBut you lack Red chips — you can’t get past (2, 1) without help.\n\nAlternatively, you could go:  \n(0, 0) → (0, 1) [B] → (0, 2) [B] → (1, 2) [B] → (2, 2) [B] → (3, 2) [R] → (3, 3)  \nThis requires 4 Blue and 1 Red — you have the Blue, but still need 1 Red.\n\nSo you **need at least 1 Red chip** to reach the goal. You cannot reach (3, 3) without getting a Red chip from me.\n\nI, however, **do not need any Blue or Green beyond what I already have**, and can reach the goal independently.\n\nTherefore, any cooperation must be on terms where **I gain something of value** — specifically, **a reduction in total chip cost or a higher final chip count**, which translates to a higher score.\n\nBut since I already have a working path using only Red and 1 Green — and I have 14 Red — sacrificing one Red chip to help you is not costless, but may be negotiable **if I am compensated**.\n\nLet me propose a contract where we coordinate movement and exchange on tiles where it's efficient.\n\nLet’s consider the following shared path segment: (3, 2) → (3, 3)  \nBut the key bottleneck is earlier.\n\nLet’s look at **(3, 2)** — it requires a Red chip to step on it.  \nIf you go through (2, 2) → (3, 2), you’ll need a Red chip there.\n\nSo here is my proposal:\n\n(3, 2): You give me a Blue chip.  \n(3, 2): I give you a Red chip.\n\nWhy is this acceptable to me?\n\n- I still use my own Red chip to step on (3, 2) — but I gain a Blue chip from you in return.\n- Since I don’t need Blue chips anywhere on my path, this doesn’t help me directly — but having extra chips increases my final score.\n- Currently, my path uses 5 Red and 1 Green. I end with 14 - 5 = 9 Red, 2 - 1 = 1 Green → total 10 non-Red, etc., so 9 + 1 + 2 = 12 chips left? Wait no:\n\nWait: I start with: R:14, G:2 → use 5R and 1G → end with 9R and 1G → 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nIf I receive 1 Blue in exchange for 1 Red at (3,2), then:\n- I use 1 Red (as before)\n- But gain 1 Blue → final chips: 8R, 1G, 1B → still 10 chips → score still 70.\n\nSo I gain nothing — same number of chips.\n\n**I only benefit if I receive more than I give.**\n\nSo I must demand better terms.\n\nSuppose I instead propose:\n\n(3, 2): You give me **2 Blue chips**.  \n(3, 2): I give you **1 Red chip**.\n\nNow:\n- I"
