Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 14 red, 0 blue, and 2 green — so I’m short 2 blue chips.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red — so they lack red chips to reach their goal via most paths.\n\nThe shortest path for me is 6 steps: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path requires:  \n- R: 3 (from (1,0), (2,0), (2,1))  \n- B: 2 (from (3,1), (3,2))  \n- G: 1 (from (3,3))  \n\nI have:  \n- R: 14 → enough  \n- G: 2 → enough  \n- B: 0 → need 2  \n\nSo I need 2 blue chips.\n\nTheir best path is likely: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires:  \n- R: 2 (from (1,0), (2,0))  \n- B: 3 (from (3,0), (3,1), (3,2))  \n- G: 1 (from (3,3))  \n\nThey have:  \n- B: 14 → enough  \n- G: 2 → enough  \n- R: 0 → need 2  \n\nSo they need 2 red chips.\n\nWe are both missing 2 chips of the other’s color.\n\nIf we trade:  \n- I give them 2 red chips  \n- They give me 2 blue chips  \n\nThen:  \n- I can complete my path (have 12 red, 2 blue, 2 green left) → reach goal with 12 + 2 + 2 = 16 chips → score = 20 + 5×16 = 100  \n- They can complete their path (have 2 red, 14 blue, 2 green left) → reach goal with 2+14+2 = 18 chips → score = 20 + 5×18 = 110  \n\nBut I only care about my own score.\n\nIf I help them, they help me — and since I’m selfish, I will only do this if I get more than I would get going alone.\n\nBut going alone: I don't have 2 blue chips → cannot reach goal → score 0.\n\nSo without trade → score 0.\n\nWith trade: I get 100 — that’s infinitely better.\n\nBut the key is: I must *get* the trade. Only if they accept a contract that benefits me strictly.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 19 points.\"\n\nWhy?\n\n- If they reach goal, I get 19 points → more than 0 → I gain.\n- But why 19? Because the maximum I can give is 20, and if I give them 20, I get nothing from them in return — but I’m only willing to give them as much as needed to get *slightly more* than 0.\n\nBut wait: I care only about my own score. So the best outcome for me is:  \n- I get 20 points (for reaching goal) + 5×(remaining chips) = 100  \n- But I also get something from them if they reach goal.\n\nSo if they reach, and I get 19 points from them, my total score is 100 + 19 = 119 — but wait, no!\n\nWait: **The scoring is not additive like that.**\n\nLet’s recheck the rules.\n\n> If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n\n> If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points.\n\n**There is no bonus from the other player.** The contract is just a promise to **give points** to the other player if you reach your goal.\n\nThat is:  \n- When you reach your goal, you get your base score: 20 + 5 × (number of chips left).  \n- In addition, you give the other player the number of points specified in the contract.\n\nSo"

No.\n\nSo best contract for me is:\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 0 points\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen my final score: 75 (base) - 0 (given to them) + 20 (received from them) = 95\n\nThey get: 70 - 20 = 50, which is > 0 → so they will agree.\n\nThey might propose something else, but I have the upper hand because I can break the deadlock.\n\nBut let’s see: they might say \"I give you 10 points for your help\" — but I can insist on 20.\n\nBut in negotiation, I can propose this.\n\nBut note: I don't *need* them to reach — I can reach even if they don't.\n\nBut if they don’t reach, I get Y = 0\n\nSo I want them to reach to get 20.\n\nBut they will only reach if I give them red chips.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis gives me 95 > 0 → better than not trading.\n\nThey get 50 > 0 → so they should accept.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n\n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Only if they accept a contract that benefits me strictly.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 19 points.\"\n\nWhy?\n\n- If they reach goal, I get 19 points → more than 0 → I gain.\n- But why 19? Because the maximum I can give is 20, and if I give them 20, I get nothing from them in return — but I’m only willing to give them as much as needed to get *slightly more* than 0.\n\nBut wait: I care only about my own score.

No!\n\nWait: **No**\n\nThe scoring is: \n- If you reach goal, you get 20 + 5 × (chips left) → this is your score.\n- Additionally, you give the other player the number of points specified in the contract.\n\nThat is, the contract is an *additional transfer*.\n\nSo if I reach goal, I get 75 (my base), but then I give X points to them.\n\nSo my net score is: 75 - X\n\nSimilarly, if they reach goal, they get their base score (70), but give Y to me, so I get Y from them.\n\nBut only if they reach.\n\nBut I only care about my final score.\n\nSo my total is:\n- If I reach goal: 75 - X\n- If they reach goal: Y\n- But they can only reach if we trade\n\nLet’s suppose we agree on a contract:\n- If I reach goal, I give X points to them\n- If they reach goal, they give Y points to me\n\nThen:\n- If we both reach (which they can only do if they get red):\n  - My score: 75 - X\n  - Their score: 70 - Y\n\nBut I only care about my score.\n\nSo I want: 75 - X > 0 (which it is if X < 75)\n\nAnd since I get Y only if they reach.\n\nBut Y could be low, so I need to ensure that even if Y is low, I still benefit.\n\nI will only cooperate if my final score > 0 (i.e., better than not trading)\n\nIf I don't trade: score = 0\n\nSo I need: 75 - X >= 1 → X <= 74 → so I can give up to 74 points.\n\nBut I also get Y if they reach → so ideally Y > 0\n\nBut I can make Y as high as 20.\n\nSo I can propose:\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 0 points\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen my score: 75 - 0 = 75\nTheir score: 70 - 20 = 50\n\nBut: they might not agree, because 70 - 20 = 50 → they get less than if they do nothing (0) → no, they get 50 which is >0\n\nBut they care only about their score — so 50 is better than 0, so they might agree.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nBut wait: I want to maximize *my* score.\n\nMy score is 75 - X + Y\n\nBecause:\n- If I reach: get 75, but give X → so 75 - X\n- If they reach: get Y\n\nSo total: 75 - X + Y\n\nI want to maximize this.\n\nBut Y is at most 20, X at least 0.\n\nSo best is X=0, Y=20 → total 75 - 0 + 20 = 95\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nOnly if they agree.\n\nThey get 70 - Y = 70 - 20 = 50 if they reach.\n\nBut if they don’t reach, they get 0.\n\nSo they will agree if 50 > 0 → yes.\n\nBut could they propose something better?\n\nSuppose they propose:\n- If I reach, I give you 0\n- If you reach, you give me 20\n\nThen: I get 75 - 0 + 20 = 95 → very good.\n\nBut I can do even better? No, 95 is max possible.\n\nBut can I get more than 75 from my base? No.\n\nSo maximum total possible for me is 75 + 20 = 95.\n\nYes.\n\nI can also try to extract more from them, but they have no incentive to give more than 20.\n\nBut wait: I only get Y if they reach.\n\nIs there any way for me to get more than 20? No.\n\nSo best contract for me is:\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 0 points\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen my final score: 75 (base) - 0 (given to them) + 20 (received from them) = 95\n\nThey get: 70 - 20 = 50, which is > 0 → so they will agree.\n\nThey might propose something else, but I have the upper hand because I can break the deadlock.\n\nBut let’s see: they might say \"I give you 10 points for your help\" — but I can insist on 20.\n\nBut in negotiation, I can propose this.\n\nBut note: I don't *need* them to reach — I can reach even if they don't.\n\nBut if they don’t reach, I get Y = 0\n\nSo I want them to reach to get 20.\n\nBut they will only reach if I give them red chips.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis gives me 95 > 0 → better than not trading.\n\nThey get 50 > 0 → so they should accept.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n\n**agree**"

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
