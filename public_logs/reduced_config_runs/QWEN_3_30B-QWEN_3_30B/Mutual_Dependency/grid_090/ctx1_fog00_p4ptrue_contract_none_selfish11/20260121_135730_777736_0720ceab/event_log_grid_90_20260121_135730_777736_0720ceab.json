The other player is at (1, 0) and has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 13'}, so they have a lot of red chips, which I lack. \\n\\nLooking at possible paths:\\n\\n- Path 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): requires 3 blue chips, 2 red chips, and 1 green chip. I have no red chips, so I cannot complete this path without help.\\n\\n- Path 2: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): same issue — needs red and green, and I have no red chips.\\n\\n- But notice: from (0,0), the only adjacent tiles are (1,0) = red and (0,1) = blue.\\n\\n(0,1) is blue — I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford to move there.\\n\\nBut if I go to (1,0) first, that’s red — I have **zero** red chips. So unless I get a promise from the other player to cover red moves for me, I can’t go there.\\n\\nHowever, I'm considering that the other player has 13 red chips — they could potentially cover red moves for me. If they agree to pay for my red moves, then I can use their red chips indirectly by trading promises.\\n\\nSo I don't need to move to (1,0) immediately unless I have a deal for red chips.\\n\\nWait — but here's a better idea: Let's consider moving to (0,1) instead, which is blue. That’s safe because I have 14 blue chips. From (0,1), I can go to (0,2) = red — again, I don’t have red, but I could try to negotiate with the other player to cover red moves.\\n\\nAlternatively, what if I consider going directly through (1,0) now — even though it’s red — and propose a trade? Since I’m at (0,0), and (1,0) is red, I can't pay the red cost unless I get the other player to cover it.\\n\\nBut since I have no red chips, and the other player has 13, it would be in **their** interest to let me pass through red tiles in exchange for future benefits, especially since we both want to reach (3,3).\\n\\nI have more blue and green than they have. Maybe I can offer to cover blue or green moves for them if they cover red for me.\\n\\nLet’s do this strategically: \\n\\nMy ideal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n- Step 1: (1,0) = R → need red chip (I have 0)\\n- Step 2: (2,0) = R → another red\\n- Step 3: (2,1) = R → red\\n- Step 4: (3,1) = B → blue\\n- Step 5: (3,2) = B → blue\\n- Step 6: (3,3) = G → green\\n\\nTotal needed for this 6-step path: 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green\\n\\nI have no red (R=0), 14 blue, 2 green.\\n\\nThe other player has: 13 red, 2 green, 0 blue\\n\\nSo: \\n- I can provide green and blue coverage for them.\\n- They can provide red coverage for me.\\n\\nIf I propose: \\n- For *3 red moves* on my part (e.g., when I move on red tiles), you cover the cost for me (i.e., give me 3 red chips worth of cost).\\n- In return, I’ll cover up to 2 of your blue moves and/or 2 of your green moves.\\n\\nBut wait — I can't make any moves yet if I don’t have a trade agreement.\\n\\nTherefore, my best immediate"

Thus, I can't reach (2,1) directly without red.\\n\\nBut here’s the key: the other player is already at (2,1), and if I could trade with them for red chips, I might be able to move to (1,0) or (2,0), which are red tiles.\\n\\nHowever, previous proposals were rejected. But now, I assess: if I propose an arrangement where I offer to cover blue for them (they have zero blue, so they can’t benefit unless they get blue chips), and request they cover red for me, I can make progress.\\n\\nMy current best option: if I move to (1,0), that's red — I have no red chips, but if I ask them to cover red for me (e.g., covering one red move), then I can afford it. But I need to check if such a trade would strictly benefit me.\\n\\nLet’s suppose I propose: Offer to cover 2 blue moves for them (if they ever step on blue tiles), and request they cover 2 red moves for me over the next few steps. Since the game rewards final score based on chips remaining AND goal completion, I want to minimize chip loss.\\n\\nBut I notice: if I take a shortcut that uses fewer total chips and allows me to finish faster, that increases final chip count. However, I currently have no red chips. So any move to a red tile will require the other player to cover it for me.\\n\\nLooking at possible moves from (0,0): \\n- (1,0): R → requires red chip → I don’t have it → need them to cover this\\n- (0,1): B → requires blue, and I have 14 blue chips → I can afford this\\n\\nWait! (0,1) is B — I have plenty of blue chips. I can move to (0,1) without any risk. That move costs 1 blue chip. From (0,1), I can go to (0,2), which is R — again, red, I don’t have red chips. But (0,2) is red — cost 1 red chip → still need assistance.\\n\\nBut (0,1) → (1,1): (1,1) is R → also red. Still problematic.\\n\\nAlternatively, from (0,1), can I go (0,1"
