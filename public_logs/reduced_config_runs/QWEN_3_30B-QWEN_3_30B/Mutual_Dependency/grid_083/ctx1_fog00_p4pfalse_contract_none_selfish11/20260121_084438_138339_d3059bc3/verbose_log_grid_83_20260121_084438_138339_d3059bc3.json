The next move is to (2, 0), which is a **B**-colored tile. Since I have 11 blue chips, paying 1 blue chip for this move is feasible. Moving forward on this path ensures I do not need to trade with the other player, preserving my chip count and reducing risk. Additionally, the alternative shorter path [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)] requires 3 red and 1 green chips — but I only have 3 red chips and need to pay 1 per move, so even if I take this path later, it would still require 3 reds. However, since I already have enough reds to complete this short path *in theory*, I could consider it — but only if I can avoid needing more than I have. However, the longer path is safe, direct, and doesn’t require reds beyond what I have. Moreover, the other player has 11 red chips and only 2 green — meaning they are well-positioned to trade reds if needed. But since I don’t need to trade now and can proceed safely on my current path, I should move directly toward my goal without delay. Staying or trading now would only risk delaying progress, especially since reaching the goal is required to score anything.",

I currently have: B:10, R:2, G:2 — so I have enough of all required chips for this path. The next move is to (3,1), which is a blue tile (from board layout: Row 3: R B R G → so (3,1) is B). I have 10 blue chips, so I can afford this move. Moving directly along this path gives me a clear, efficient route to the goal with no trading needed. Since I have sufficient chips and the path is short, I should proceed immediately. This maximizes my final chip count (5 per remaining chip) and ensures I reach the goal. I do not need to trade or deviate. The other player is at (2,1) with R:10, G:2, B:0 — they are also close to the goal but do not have blue chips, so they likely need to trade for B to proceed.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
