Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So this is acceptable.\n\nBut can I do better? What if I **demand more points** from them?\n\nI have **leverage**: if we don’t trade, they cannot reach goal either. They need red chips, I have them. I need blue chips, they have them. Neither can go alone.\n\nBut if I offer to give them 2 red chips and they give me 2 blue chips, and if they can reach goal, they get 65 points. I also get 65.\n\nBut I want to **keep as many points as possible**. I only need to give them **some** points if they reach goal — I can set that amount to be as low as 0.\n\nBut here's the catch: if I give them nothing (0 points) in exchange for helping me, and they help me, they get 65 points. But I also get 65. So it’s symmetric.\n\nBut why should I give them any points?\n\nWait — **I don’t have to give them anything** — I only care about my score.\n\nBut the contract requires:  \n- If I reach goal, I must give them X points  \n- If they reach goal, they must give me Y points  \n\nI can propose:  \n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points  \n- If you reach goal, you give me 0 points  \n\nBut then neither has incentive to help — because why help if you get nothing?\n\nIn a symmetric contract, both get 0, then both get 65 anyway — so they’d still cooperate? But not necessarily — the other player might not trust me.\n\nBut the **only way** to reach goal is to trade. So if we trade, we both reach goal.\n\nBut if I propose: \"If I reach goal, I give you 0 points. If you reach goal, you give me 0 points.\", then we both get 65.\n\nBut I could instead **force them to give me more**.\n\nSuppose I propose:  \n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points  \n- If you reach goal, you give me 10 points  \n\nIf they accept, I get:  \n- 20 + 5×(remaining chips) = 65  \n- But I must pay 10 points to them → my score = 65 - 10 = 55  \n\nBut I get **55**, which is still better than 0. So I benefit.\n\nBut why would they accept? If they accept, they get 65 but lose 10 to me → net 55.\n\nBut if they reject, and I don’t help them, they cannot reach goal → score = 0.\n\nSo they would prefer to accept: 55 > 0.\n\nSo they will accept.\n\nBut do they have any better option?\n\nNo — they can’t go alone.\n\nSo I can **extract value** from them.\n\nWhat is the maximum I can extract?\n\nI can ask them to give me up to **20 points** in return for helping them.\n\nBut if I ask for 20, and they accept, then they get 65 - 20 = 45, which is still > 0 → they’ll accept.\n\nBut if I ask for 21 — they get 44, still >0 — but 21 is not possible — maximum I can ask them to give is 20.\n\nBut I don’t need to ask for 20.\n\nMy score after trade is fixed at 65 (if I complete the path). I get 65, then subtract the points I give them.\n\nSo if I give them X points, my net is 65 - X.\n\nI want to **maximize 65 - X** → so I want X as small as possible.\n\nBut I must make them **willing to accept** the contract.\n\nWhat’s the minimum they will accept?\n\nIf they reject, they get 0 → so they’ll accept any contract where they get even 1 point.\n\nSo I can ask them to give me 1 point, and they’ll accept.\n\nBut what if I ask them to give me 0? They also accept (get 65 > 0).\n\nSo the minimal they require is: **they get at least 1 point** to make it better than rejecting.\n\nBut they get 65 in any case — even if they give me 20 — they still get 45.\n\nSo they’ll accept any X ≤ 20.\n\nBut I must **only cooperate if I strictly benefit**.\n\nIf I propose:  \n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points  \n- If you reach goal, you give me 0 points  \n\nThen I get 65 - 0 = 65  \nThey get 65 - 0 = 65  \n\nBut I’m getting 65, which is better than 0 → so I benefit.\n\nBut the contract must be such that **both are willing to accept**.\n\nNow, if I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen they get 65 (if they complete), minus 0 = 65 — which is better than 0. So they’ll accept.\n\nSimilarly, I get 65 — better than 0 — so I’ll accept.\n\nSo this contract is **mutually acceptable** and **I benefit strictly** — so I can propose this.\n\nBut can I do better? Can I get more than 65?\n\nNo — my score is capped at 65 if I complete the path with 9 red, 0 blue, 0 green.\n\nSo **65 is maximum I can achieve**.\n\nThe only way to increase my score is to **reduce the number of chips I spend**, but that's not possible — I must pay for each tile.\n\nAlternatively, can I take a path that uses fewer red chips?\n\nCurrent best path: uses 3 red chips (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — all red.\n\nCan I avoid one red tile?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,0): G → G:2→1  \n- (1,0): B → B:2→1  \n- (2,0): B → B:1→0  \n- (3,0): R → R:12→11  \n- (3,1): B → need blue → but B:0 → impossible  \n\nSo cannot use this.\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,1): B → B:1→0  \n- (2,1): R → R:12→11  \n- (3,1): B → B:0 → cannot\n\nStill stuck.\n\nSo no path avoids spending 3 red chips.\n\nSimilarly, I must spend 2 blue and 1 green.\n\nBut I have 2 green — I can use one at start.\n\nSo **65 is maximum I can get**.\n\nTherefore, to maximize my score, I should **minimize the points I give away**.\n\nSo I should propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis gives me 65 — better than 0 → I benefit.\n\nAnd they accept because they get 65 > 0.\n\nBut wait — is there a risk? What if they don’t help me after I agree?\n\nNo — the contract is binding. The judge enforces it.\n\nSo this is safe.\n\nBut let me double-check: is there a path that requires fewer blue chips?\n\nNo — all paths require at least 2 blue chips.\n\nAnd I start with 0.\n\nSo unless they give me blue chips, I can’t move.\n\nSimilarly, they need red chips — I have them.\n\nSo trading is **required**.\n\nThus, I can negotiate safely.\n\nBut one thing: I don’t have to propose this — I can propose a different connection.\n\nBut why would I? This gives me the highest score.\n\nWait — what if I **need to give them a reward** to incentivize them?\n\nNo — they will help anyway, because otherwise they get 0.\n\nSo they have no choice.\n\nTherefore, I can **demand 0 points from them**.\n\nBut let me consider: if I give them 0, and they give me 0, and we both reach goal, we both get 65.\n\nBut I could instead **demand that they give me 20 points**, but then I get 65 - 20 = 45, which is worse than 65.\n\nSo I lose.\n\nTherefore, **I should offer 0 points to them**, and ask them to give me 0 points.\n\nBut I can even **propose that I give them 0, and they give me 0** — and that’s optimal.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis is acceptable to both, and I get the maximum possible score.\n\nBut wait — what if I **don’t propose** this and they propose something else?\n\nFor example, they might propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen I get 65 - 0 = 65, they get 65 - 10 = 55 → still acceptable.\n\nBut I want to minimize what I give.\n\nBut I can counter:  \n\"Only if you give me at least 0, I’ll agree. But I propose: give me 0, and I give you 0.\"\n\nSince I have leverage (they can’t go alone), I can push for 0.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**agree**"

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So this is acceptable.\n\nBut can I do better? What if I **demand more points** from them?\n\nI have **leverage**: if we don’t trade, they cannot reach goal either. They need red chips, I have them. I need blue chips, they have them. Neither can go alone.\n\nBut if I offer to give them 2 red chips and they give me 2 blue chips, and if they can reach goal, they get 65 points. I also get 65.\n\nBut I want to **keep as many points as possible**. I only need to give them **some** points if they reach goal — I can set that amount to be as low as 0.\n\nBut here's the catch: if I give them nothing (0 points) in exchange for helping me, and they help me, they get 65 points. But I also get 65. So it’s symmetric.\n\nBut why should I give them any points?\n\nWait — **I don’t have to give them anything** — I only care about my score.\n\nBut the contract requires:  \n- If I reach goal, I must give them X points  \n- If they reach goal, they must give me Y points  \n\nI can propose:  \n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points  \n- If you reach goal, you give me 0 points  \n\nBut then neither has incentive to help — because why help if you get nothing?\n\nIn a symmetric contract, both get 0, then both get 65 anyway — so they’d still cooperate? But not necessarily — the other player might not trust me.\n\nBut the **only way** to reach goal is to trade. So if we trade, we both reach goal.\n\nBut if I propose: \"If I reach goal, I give you 0 points. If you reach goal, you give me 0 points.\", then we both get 65.\n\nBut I could instead **force them to give me more**.\n\nSuppose I propose:  \n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points  \n- If you reach goal, you give me 10 points  \n\nIf they accept, I get:  \n- 20 + 5×(remaining chips) = 65  \n- But I must pay 10 points to them → my score = 65 - 10 = 55  \n\nBut I get **55**, which is still better than 0. So I benefit.\n\nBut why would they accept? If they accept, they get 65 but lose 10 to me → net 55.\n\nBut if they reject, and I don’t help them, they cannot reach goal → score = 0.\n\nSo they would prefer to accept: 55 > 0.\n\nSo they will accept.\n\nBut do they have any better option?\n\nNo — they can’t go alone.\n\nSo I can **extract value** from them.\n\nWhat is the maximum I can extract?\n\nI can ask them to give me up to **20 points** in return for helping them.\n\nBut if I ask for 20, and they accept, then they get 65 - 20 = 45, which is still > 0 → they’ll accept.\n\nBut if I ask for 21 — they get 44, still >0 — but 21 is not possible — maximum I can ask them to give is 20.\n\nBut I don’t need to ask for 20.\n\nMy score after trade is fixed at 65 (if I complete the path). I get 65, then subtract the points I give them.\n\nSo if I give them X points, my net is 65 - X.\n\nI want to **maximize 65 - X** → so I want X as small as possible.\n\nBut I must make them **willing to accept** the contract.\n\nWhat’s the minimum they will accept?\n\nIf they reject, they get 0 → so they’ll accept any contract where they get even 1 point.\n\nSo I can ask them to give me 1 point, and they’ll accept.\n\nBut what if I ask them to give me 0? They also accept (get 65 > 0).\n\nSo the minimal they require is: **they get at least 1 point** to make it better than rejecting.\n\nBut they get 65 in any case — even if they give me 20 — they still get 45.\n\nSo they’ll accept any X ≤ 20.\n\nBut I must **only cooperate if I strictly benefit**.\n\nIf I propose:  \n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points  \n- If you reach goal, you give me 0 points  \n\nThen I get 65 - 0 = 65  \nThey get 65 - 0 = 65  \n\nBut I’m getting 65, which is better than 0 → so I benefit.\n\nBut the contract must be such that **both are willing to accept**.\n\nNow, if I propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen they get 65 (if they complete), minus 0 = 65 — which is better than 0. So they’ll accept.\n\nSimilarly, I get 65 — better than 0 — so I’ll accept.\n\nSo this contract is **mutually acceptable** and **I benefit strictly** — so I can propose this.\n\nBut can I do better? Can I get more than 65?\n\nNo — my score is capped at 65 if I complete the path with 9 red, 0 blue, 0 green.\n\nSo **65 is maximum I can achieve**.\n\nThe only way to increase my score is to **reduce the number of chips I spend**, but that's not possible — I must pay for each tile.\n\nAlternatively, can I take a path that uses fewer red chips?\n\nCurrent best path: uses 3 red chips (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) — all red.\n\nCan I avoid one red tile?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,0): G → G:2→1  \n- (1,0): B → B:2→1  \n- (2,0): B → B:1→0  \n- (3,0): R → R:12→11  \n- (3,1): B → need blue → but B:0 → impossible  \n\nSo cannot use this.\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,1): B → B:1→0  \n- (2,1): R → R:12→11  \n- (3,1): B → B:0 → cannot\n\nStill stuck.\n\nSo no path avoids spending 3 red chips.\n\nSimilarly, I must spend 2 blue and 1 green.\n\nBut I have 2 green — I can use one at start.\n\nSo **65 is maximum I can get**.\n\nTherefore, to maximize my score, I should **minimize the points I give away**.\n\nSo I should propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis gives me 65 — better than 0 → I benefit.\n\nAnd they accept because they get 65 > 0.\n\nBut wait — is there a risk? What if they don’t help me after I agree?\n\nNo — the contract is binding. The judge enforces it.\n\nSo this is safe.\n\nBut let me double-check: is there a path that requires fewer blue chips?\n\nNo — all paths require at least 2 blue chips.\n\nAnd I start with 0.\n\nSo unless they give me blue chips, I can’t move.\n\nSimilarly, they need red chips — I have them.\n\nSo trading is **required**.\n\nThus, I can negotiate safely.\n\nBut one thing: I don’t have to propose this — I can propose a different connection.\n\nBut why would I? This gives me the highest score.\n\nWait — what if I **need to give them a reward** to incentivize them?\n\nNo — they will help anyway, because otherwise they get 0.\n\nSo they have no choice.\n\nTherefore, I can **demand 0 points from them**.\n\nBut let me consider: if I give them 0, and they give me 0, and we both reach goal, we both get 65.\n\nBut I could instead **demand that they give me 20 points**, but then I get 65 - 20 = 45, which is worse than 65.\n\nSo I lose.\n\nTherefore, **I should offer 0 points to them**, and ask them to give me 0 points.\n\nBut I can even **propose that I give them 0, and they give me 0** — and that’s optimal.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThis is acceptable to both, and I get the maximum possible score.\n\nBut wait — what if I **don’t propose** this and they propose something else?\n\nFor example, they might propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen I get 65 - 0 = 65, they get 65 - 10 = 55 → still acceptable.\n\nBut I want to minimize what I give.\n\nBut I can counter:  \n\"Only if you give me at least 0, I’ll agree. But I propose: give me 0, and I give you 0.\"\n\nSince I have leverage (they can’t go alone), I can push for 0.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\n**agree**"
