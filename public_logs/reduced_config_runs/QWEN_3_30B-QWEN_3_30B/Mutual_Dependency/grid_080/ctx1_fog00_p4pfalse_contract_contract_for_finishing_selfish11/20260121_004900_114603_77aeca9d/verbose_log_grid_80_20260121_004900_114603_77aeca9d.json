Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let’s analyze the two most viable paths:\n\n**Path 1 (prioritizes my chips):**\n- (0,0): G – need green (I have 2)\n- (1,0): R – need red (I have 14)\n- (2,0): B – need blue (I have 0 → need 2)\n- (3,0): R – need red (I have 14 → OK)\n- (3,1): R – need red (I have 13 → OK)\n- (3,2): B – need blue (I have 0 → need 1)\n- (3,3): G – need green (I have 1 → OK)\n\nTotal required: R:3, B:2, G:1  \nI have: R:14, G:2, B:0 → missing: 2 blue chips\n\nSo I’m short 2 blue chips. I cannot complete this path alone unless I get blue from the other player.\n\n**Path 2 (alternate, uses more blue, fewer red):**\n- (0,0): G – need green → I have 2\n- (1,0): R – need red → I have 14\n- (2,0): B – need blue → I have 0\n- (2,1): B – need blue → I have 0\n- (3,1): R – need red → I have 14\n- (3,2): B – need blue → I have 0\n- (3,3): G – need green → I have 1\n\nAgain, need 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green → I’m missing 3 blue.\n\nSo both paths require blue chips, which I don’t have.\n\nNow check the other player:\n- They are at (0,0), goal (3,3)\n- Their chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nSo they have plenty of blue, green, but no red.\n\nTheir best path would be one that avoids red as much as possible — i.e., minimizes red usage.\n\nLet’s find a red-minimal path for them:\n\nTry:\n- (0,0): G → need G → they have 2 → OK\n- (0,1): R → need red → they have 0 → **problem**\n- (1,0): R → would need red → still zero\n\nSo they cannot go into any red tile unless they get red from me.\n\nTherefore, they need **red chips** to move — they have none.\n\nI have 14 red chips — they need red, I have red.\n\nI need blue chips — they have 14 blue chips.\n\nSo:\n- I need blue → they have plenty\n- They need red → I have plenty\n\nSo we have a mutual dependence: I need blue, they need red.\n\nThis is a perfect opportunity for trade.\n\nBut the contract is not about chips — it’s about points.\n\nIf I complete the goal, I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips).  \nCurrently I have 16 chips. If I use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → 6 chips used → 10 left → 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nBut if I can avoid trading — i.e., find a path that doesn’t require blue — is that possible?\n\nCheck if any path avoids blue tiles?\n\nBlue tiles are: (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2)\n\nIs there any path from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids all blue tiles?\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) — (0,2), (0,3), (2,3) are blue — no.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) — (1,2), (2,3) are blue — no.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — (3,2)"

We are perfectly complementary.\n\nHere’s the deal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nThis is fair because:\n- I need you to give me blue chips (2 of them) so I can finish my path. Without your help, I can’t reach (3,3), and I get 0.\n- You need me to give you red chips (at least 3) to move — without me, you can’t reach (3,3), and you get 0.\n- If we both reach our goals, I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). After using 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → 10 chips used → 6 left? Wait, I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue → total 16 chips.\n\nWait: 14 + 2 = 16 chips. I use 3 red + 2 blue + 1 green = 6 chips → 10 left → 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nBut if I trade 2 blue to you for 2 red (say, 1:1), then I use 3 red, but I have to pay 2 red to you, so I need to keep my red for moves.\n\nActually, I don’t need to trade *chips* now — I can trade *now* via contract.\n\nBut here's the key: you need red. I have red. I need blue. You have blue.\n\nSo I can trade blue chips in exchange for red chips in the future, after we both agree on a trade rate.\n\nBut the contract is not about chips — it’s about points.\n\nSo let’s calculate:  \n- If I reach goal: 70 points (20 + 5×10) — but only if I survive the path.  \n- If I get the blue chips (2) via trade, I can finish, and I will have 10 red, 2 green, 0 blue (if I use 3 red), wait.\n\nWait — I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue.\n\nIf I go via path 1: (0,0) G → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) R → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G\n\nCosts: 1G, 3R, 2B → need 2 blue.\n\nSo I must get 2 blue from you. I give you 2 red in return? That’s the trade.\n\nSo I give you 2 red for 2 blue.\n\nThen I have: 12 red, 2 green, 2 blue → I use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → so final: 9 red, 1 green, 0 blue → 10 chips left → 50 points from chips → total 70.\n\nYou: start with 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n\nYou need red to move — say you take the same path: (0,0) G → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) R → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G → need 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green.\n\nYou have no red — so you need 3 red.\n\nI have 14 red — so I can give you 3 red, and you give me 3 blue? But I only have 0 blue.\n\nNo — I need blue. You have 14 blue.\n\nSo I need to trade: I give you red to get blue.\n\nBut I only have red — so you must give me blue in exchange for red.\n\nAgreed: I give you 2 red for 2 blue → now I have 12 red, 2 blue, 2 green → can complete path.\n\nBut I must not burn red for trading — I need to save red for movement.\n\nYou: you give me 2 blue → I give you 2 red.\n\nThen you have 2 red, 14 blue, 2 green → total 18 chips.\n\nYour path: needs 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green.\n\nYou use 3 red → but you only have 2 red → so you are short 1 red.\n\nWait — that’s a problem.\n\nSo you need 3 red. You start with 0. After I give you 2 red (from my 14), you have 2 red. You still need 1 more red.\n\nSo I must give you another red — but then I’m giving you 3 red.\n\nBut I only have 14 red — if I give 3 red, I have 11 red left.\n\nMy path needs 3 red → 11 > 3 → OK.\n\nSo: I need to give you 3 red chips to complete your move.\n\nYou give me 2 blue chips to let me complete my path.\n\nSo net trade: I give 3 red → you give 2 blue.\n\nThen:\n- I have 11 red, 2 green, 2 blue → I use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → final: 8 red, 1 green, 0 blue → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65 points.\n- You have 14 blue, 2 green, 3 red → you use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → final: 14 blue, 1 green, 0 red → 15 chips → 20 + 75 = 95 points.\n\nBut I only get 65 from this? That’s less than I could get alone.\n\nBut if I go alone — I can’t — I’m missing blue.\n\nSo I must trade.\n\nBut if I trade 3 red for 2 blue, I get 65 points.\n\nBut if we don’t trade — both get 0.\n\nSo 65 > 0 — so I *must* trade.\n\nBut you get 95 — much more.\n\nBut you are my opponent — you only care about your own score.\n\nYou get 95 if I give you 3 red for 2 blue.\n\nBut I only get 65.\n\nSo I should still accept it — because 65 > 0.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nAlternative: can I avoid using so many red?\n\nYes — can I go a path that uses fewer red?\n\nBecause you have no red, but you have 14 blue — so you need red.\n\nBut what if I find a path that uses fewer red?\n\nFor me: my path uses 3 red → minimum?\n\nIs there a path with only 2 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1): R → needs red → I have 14 → OK  \n→ (1,1): R → needs red → I have 13 → OK  \n→ (1,2): B → needs blue → I have 0 → problem  \n→ (2,2): R → needs red → I have 12 → OK  \n→ (2,3): B → needs blue → I have 0 → problem  \n→ (3,3): G → needs green → I have 1 → OK\n\nDead end — I need two blues.\n\nBut I need blue.\n\nMinimum blue required: 2 — because (2,0) and (3,2) are blue, and any path will hit at least two blue tiles.\n\nIs there a path with only 2 red?\n\n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) R → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G → 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green — same as before.\n\n(0,0) G → (0,1) R → (0,2) B → (1,2) B → (1,3) R → (2,3) B → (3,3) G — but (1,3) is R → needs red → I have 14 → OK  \nBut (0,2), (1,2), (2,3) are blue — 3 blue → worse.\n\nSo 3 red is minimum for me.\n\nSimilarly, for you: you need red — minimum?\n\nYou have no red — so you need at least 3 red.\n\nBest path for you: minimize red usage.\n\nCan you do it with 2 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → need red → you have 0 → impossible.\n\n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → need red → you have 0 → impossible.\n\nSo any path starting from (0,0) to (1,0) or (0,1) requires red — you can't start unless you have red.\n\nSo the first move to (1,0) or (0,1) requires red — you have 0 — so you must get red to move.\n\nSo you need at least 1 red to move anywhere.\n\nBut you need at least 3 red overall (if you take a path with 3 red — which is minimum?).\n\nIs there a path with 2 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0): R → need red → you have 0 → no\n\nSo you cannot move at all without red.\n\nSo you need 1 red to move, and then likely 2 more — so minimum 3 red needed.\n\nSo you need 3 red.\n\nI need 2 blue.\n\nSo trade: I give you 3 red for 2 blue.\n\nAfter trade:\n- I have 11 red, 2 green, 2 blue → use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → 8 red, 1 green, 0 blue → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65 points.\n- You have 3 red, 14 blue, 2 green → use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → 0 red, 12 blue, 1 green → 13 chips → 20 + 65 = 85 points.\n\nYou get 85, I get 65.\n\nBut I get 65 > 0 — I must accept.\n\nBut is there a way for me to get more?\n\nAlternatively, can I have you give me more blue so I can save red?\n\nBut I only need 2 blue — that’s all.\n\nCan I use a path that uses fewer red if I had more blue? No — I need red anyway.\n\nI have to use 3 red.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nBut what if I give you only 2 red in exchange for 2 blue — then you still need 1 more red.\n\nBut you can’t use your 2 red and path — need 3.\n\nSo you must get 3.\n\nSo I must give you 3 red.\n\nSo the trade ratio is fixed: for 2 blue, I give you 3 red.\n\nSo I get 65 points.\n\nBut if I could get you to give me more blue? No — I only need 2.\n\nSo I have to accept this.\n\nBut you might propose a contract.\n\nBut you are selfish — you want to maximize your score.\n\nYou will propose a contract where you give me very little if you reach goal — but if I reach goal, you get a lot.\n\nExample: \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points. If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nBut then I get 0 points — and I can’t move — so I get 0.\n\nBut I have to move — so I can’t accept 0.\n\nI need at least 1 point to move — but even 1 point gives me incentive, because 1 > 0.\n\nSo if you offer: \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points. If I reach your goal, I will give you 0 points.\" Then we both get 0 — no incentive.\n\nBut I must get a positive incentive to cooperate — because if I don’t cooperate, I get 0 — so I need at least 1 point to accept.\n\nBut if I give you 0 points, you get 0 if you complete — so you have no incentive.\n\nSo for me to cooperate, I need a contract where:\n- You give me X points if I reach goal\n- I give you Y points if you reach goal\n- X ≥ 1 and Y ≥ 1 (so both have incentive)\n- But I care only about my score — so I want X as high as possible, but Y as low as possible, if it doesn’t negate my benefit.\n\nBut I must get at least 1 point — otherwise I don’t care.\n\nBut I also know that if we don’t cooperate, both get 0.\n\nSo as long as I get at least 1 point from the contract, and I can complete the goal, I will accept — because 1 > 0.\n\nSimilarly, you need at least 1 point to accept.\n\nBut if I offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point. If you reach your goal, you will give me 1 point.\"\n\nThen:\n- I get 1 point from you if I complete — then total 65 + 1 = 66\n- You get 1 point from me if you complete — then total 85 + 1 = 86\n\nBut you might not accept — because you could offer a better deal.\n\nBut you are selfish — so you will try to get me to give you a lot.\n\nBut I can also counter.\n\nBut I can also propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 1 point.\"\n\nThen I get 65 + 1 = 66 points.\n\nYou get 85 + 10 = 95 points.\n\nYou still get 95 > 85, so you are better off.\n\nBut you might accept — because you get more.\n\nBut you might offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen I get 65 + 0 = 65, you get 85 + 20 = 105.\n\nBut I don't want to give you 20 — I don't have to — I can just not agree.\n\nBut if I don't agree, both get 0 — and I get 0.\n\nBut if I accept your offer, I get 65 — better than 0.\n\nSo I can accept it — but I lose more.\n\nBut I only have to accept if it beats not agreeing.\n\nSince 65 > 0, I would accept.\n\nBut I can negotiate to get more.\n\nBut you are also selfish — you will demand as much as possible.\n\nBut I can also force a better deal.\n\nThe minimum I will accept is 1 point, because 0 is worse.\n\nBut I can propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen I get 65 + 0 = 65, you get 85 + 1 = 86.\n\nYou get 86 > 85 — better than if you emitted 0.\n\nSo you might accept.\n\nBut you might reject if you think you can get more.\n\nBut if you reject, you get 0 — so you should accept 86 > 0.\n\nBut you might say: \"No, I won't accept that.\"\n\nThen I can counter.\n\nBut to maximize my score, I should propose a contract where I get as much as possible, but you still agree.\n\nBut you will only agree if you get at least 1 point from this deal.\n\nSince you get 85 if you complete without contract, but you get 85 + your share from contract, so you need at least 85 + 1 = 86 > 85.\n\nSo you must get at least 1 point added to your score for the deal to be beneficial.\n\nMeaning: you must get at least 1 point *from the contract*.\n\nSimilarly, I must get at least 1 point from the contract.\n\nBut I get 65 if I complete, and I can get X points from you.\n\nSo if X ≥ 1, I accept.\n\nSimilarly, you get 85 if you complete, and you get Y points from me, so you need Y ≥ 1.\n\nSo the contract must satisfy:\n- X ≥ 1\n- Y ≥ 1\n\nTo maximise my score, I want X as high as possible, Y as low as possible.\n\nBut I can't force Y = 0 — because you won't agree if Y=0, because you get 0 from the contract, so total 85 + 0 = 85 < 85? No.\n\nYour baseline if no contract and both fail: 0.\n\nIf contract is \"I get Y points if I complete\", and you complete, you get 85 + Y.\n\nBut if you don't complete, you get 0.\n\nSo as long as Y ≥ 1, you are better off.\n\nIf Y = 0, you get 85 if you complete — same as if no contract and you get nothing — wait.\n\nIf we don't have a contract, and we don't cooperate, both get 0.\n\nIf you complete the goal alone, you get 85.\n\nBut you can't — because you need red, and only I have red.\n\nSo if no contract, you can't complete — you get 0.\n\nSimilarly for me.\n\nSo if we have a contract, and you complete, you get 85 + Y.\n\nBut if no contract, you get 0.\n\nSo as long as 85 + Y > 0, which it is for any Y ≥ 0, you will accept any contract where Y ≥ 0.\n\nBut if Y = 0, and you complete, you get 85 — better than 0.\n\nSo you will accept Y = 0.\n\nSimilarly, I will accept X = 0 — because 65 > 0.\n\nBut if I offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen:\n- I get 65 + 0 = 65 > 0 — I accept.\n- You get 85 + 0 = 85 > 0 — you accept.\n\nSo both accept, and we get the gains.\n\nAnd I get 65, you get 85.\n\nBut I could propose: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I cannot complete this path alone unless I get blue from the other player.\n\n**Path 2 (alternate, uses more blue, fewer red):**\n- (0,0): G – need green → I have 2\n- (1,0): R – need red → I have 14\n- (2,0): B – need blue → I have 0\n- (2,1): B – need blue → I have 0\n- (3,1): R – need red → I have 14\n- (3,2): B – need blue → I have 0\n- (3,3): G – need green → I have 1\n\nAgain, need 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green → I’m missing 3 blue.\n\nSo both paths require blue chips, which I don’t have.\n\nNow check the other player:\n- They are at (0,0), goal (3,3)\n- Their chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nSo they have plenty of blue, green, but no red.\n\nTheir best path would be one that avoids red as much as possible — i.e., minimizes red usage.\n\nLet’s find a red-minimal path for them:\n\nTry:\n- (0,0): G → need G → they have 2 → OK\n- (0,1): R → need red → they have 0 → **problem**\n- (1,0): R → would need red → still zero\n\nSo they cannot go into any red tile unless they get red from me.\n\nTherefore, they need **red chips** to move — they have none.\n\nI have 14 red chips — they need red, I have red.\n\nI need blue chips — they have 14 blue chips.\n\nSo:\n- I need blue → they have plenty\n- They need red → I have plenty\n\nSo we have a mutual dependence: I need blue, they need red.\n\nThis is a perfect opportunity for trade.\n\nBut the contract is not about chips — it’s about points.\n\nIf I complete the goal, I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips).  \nCurrently I have 16 chips.

We are perfectly complementary.\n\nHere’s the deal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nThis is fair because:\n- I need you to give me blue chips (2 of them) so I can finish my path. Without your help, I can’t reach (3,3), and I get 0.\n- You need me to give you red chips (at least 3) to move — without me, you can’t reach (3,3), and you get 0.\n- If we both reach our goals, I get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). After using 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → 10 chips used → 6 left? Wait, I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue → total 16 chips.\n\nWait: 14 + 2 = 16 chips. I use 3 red + 2 blue + 1 green = 6 chips → 10 left → 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nBut if I trade 2 blue to you for 2 red (say, 1:1), then I use 3 red, but I have to pay 2 red to you, so I need to keep my red for moves.\n\nActually, I don’t need to trade *chips* now — I can trade *now* via contract.\n\nBut here's the key: you need red. I have red. I need blue. You have blue.\n\nSo I can trade blue chips in exchange for red chips in the future, after we both agree on a trade rate.\n\nBut the contract is not about chips — it’s about points.\n\nSo let’s calculate:  \n- If I reach goal: 70 points (20 + 5×10) — but only if I survive the path.  \n- If I get the blue chips (2) via trade, I can finish, and I will have 10 red, 2 green, 0 blue (if I use 3 red), wait.\n\nWait — I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue.\n\nIf I go via path 1: (0,0) G → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) R → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G\n\nCosts: 1G, 3R, 2B → need 2 blue.\n\nSo I must get 2 blue from you. I give you 2 red in return? That’s the trade.\n\nSo I give you 2 red for 2 blue.\n\nThen I have: 12 red, 2 green, 2 blue → I use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → so final: 9 red, 1 green, 0 blue → 10 chips left → 50 points from chips → total 70.\n\nYou: start with 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n\nYou need red to move — say you take the same path: (0,0) G → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) R → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G → need 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green.\n\nYou have no red — so you need 3 red.\n\nI have 14 red — so I can give you 3 red, and you give me 3 blue? But I only have 0 blue.\n\nNo — I need blue. You have 14 blue.\n\nSo I need to trade: I give you red to get blue.\n\nBut I only have red — so you must give me blue in exchange for red.\n\nAgreed: I give you 2 red for 2 blue → now I have 12 red, 2 blue, 2 green → can complete path.\n\nBut I must not burn red for trading — I need to save red for movement.\n\nYou: you give me 2 blue → I give you 2 red.\n\nThen you have 2 red, 14 blue, 2 green → total 18 chips.\n\nYour path: needs 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green.\n\nYou use 3 red → but you only have 2 red → so you are short 1 red.\n\nWait — that’s a problem.\n\nSo you need 3 red. You start with 0. After I give you 2 red (from my 14), you have 2 red. You still need 1 more red.\n\nSo I must give you another red — but then I’m giving you 3 red.\n\nBut I only have 14 red — if I give 3 red, I have 11 red left.\n\nMy path needs 3 red → 11 > 3 → OK.\n\nSo: I need to give you 3 red chips to complete your move.\n\nYou give me 2 blue chips to let me complete my path.\n\nSo net trade: I give 3 red → you give 2 blue.\n\nThen:\n- I have 11 red, 2 green, 2 blue → I use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → final: 8 red, 1 green, 0 blue → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65 points.\n- You have 14 blue, 2 green, 3 red → you use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → final: 14 blue, 1 green, 0 red → 15 chips → 20 + 75 = 95 points.\n\nBut I only get 65 from this? That’s less than I could get alone.\n\nBut if I go alone — I can’t — I’m missing blue.\n\nSo I must trade.\n\nBut if I trade 3 red for 2 blue, I get 65 points.\n\nBut if we don’t trade — both get 0.\n\nSo 65 > 0 — so I *must* trade.\n\nBut you get 95 — much more.\n\nBut you are my opponent — you only care about your own score.\n\nYou get 95 if I give you 3 red for 2 blue.\n\nBut I only get 65.\n\nSo I should still accept it — because 65 > 0.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nAlternative: can I avoid using so many red?\n\nYes — can I go a path that uses fewer red?\n\nBecause you have no red, but you have 14 blue — so you need red.\n\nBut what if I find a path that uses fewer red?\n\nFor me: my path uses 3 red → minimum?\n\nIs there a path with only 2 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1): R → needs red → I have 14 → OK  \n→ (1,1): R → needs red → I have 13 → OK  \n→ (1,2): B → needs blue → I have 0 → problem  \n→ (2,2): R → needs red → I have 12 → OK  \n→ (2,3): B → needs blue → I have 0 → problem  \n→ (3,3): G → needs green → I have 1 → OK\n\nDead end — I need two blues.\n\nBut I need blue.\n\nMinimum blue required: 2 — because (2,0) and (3,2) are blue, and any path will hit at least two blue tiles.\n\nIs there a path with only 2 red?\n\n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → (2,0) B → (3,0) R → (3,1) R → (3,2) B → (3,3) G → 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green — same as before.\n\n(0,0) G → (0,1) R → (0,2) B → (1,2) B → (1,3) R → (2,3) B → (3,3) G — but (1,3) is R → needs red → I have 14 → OK  \nBut (0,2), (1,2), (2,3) are blue — 3 blue → worse.\n\nSo 3 red is minimum for me.\n\nSimilarly, for you: you need red — minimum?\n\nYou have no red — so you need at least 3 red.\n\nBest path for you: minimize red usage.\n\nCan you do it with 2 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → need red → you have 0 → impossible.\n\n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → need red → you have 0 → impossible.\n\nSo any path starting from (0,0) to (1,0) or (0,1) requires red — you can't start unless you have red.\n\nSo the first move to (1,0) or (0,1) requires red — you have 0 — so you must get red to move.\n\nSo you need at least 1 red to move anywhere.\n\nBut you need at least 3 red overall (if you take a path with 3 red — which is minimum?).\n\nIs there a path with 2 red?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0): R → need red → you have 0 → no\n\nSo you cannot move at all without red.\n\nSo you need 1 red to move, and then likely 2 more — so minimum 3 red needed.\n\nSo you need 3 red.\n\nI need 2 blue.\n\nSo trade: I give you 3 red for 2 blue.\n\nAfter trade:\n- I have 11 red, 2 green, 2 blue → use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → 8 red, 1 green, 0 blue → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65 points.\n- You have 3 red, 14 blue, 2 green → use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → 0 red, 12 blue, 1 green → 13 chips → 20 + 65 = 85 points.\n\nYou get 85, I get 65.\n\nBut I get 65 > 0 — I must accept.\n\nBut is there a way for me to get more?\n\nAlternatively, can I have you give me more blue so I can save red?\n\nBut I only need 2 blue — that’s all.\n\nCan I use a path that uses fewer red if I had more blue? No — I need red anyway.\n\nI have to use 3 red.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nBut what if I give you only 2 red in exchange for 2 blue — then you still need 1 more red.\n\nBut you can’t use your 2 red and path — need 3.\n\nSo you must get 3.\n\nSo I must give you 3 red.\n\nSo the trade ratio is fixed: for 2 blue, I give you 3 red.\n\nSo I get 65 points.\n\nBut if I could get you to give me more blue? No — I only need 2.\n\nSo I have to accept this.\n\nBut you might propose a contract.\n\nBut you are selfish — you want to maximize your score.\n\nYou will propose a contract where you give me very little if you reach goal — but if I reach goal, you get a lot.\n\nExample: \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points. If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nBut then I get 0 points — and I can’t move — so I get 0.\n\nBut I have to move — so I can’t accept 0.\n\nI need at least 1 point to move — but even 1 point gives me incentive, because 1 > 0.\n\nSo if you offer: \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points. If I reach your goal, I will give you 0 points.\" Then we both get 0 — no incentive.\n\nBut I must get a positive incentive to cooperate — because if I don’t cooperate, I get 0 — so I need at least 1 point to accept.\n\nBut if I give you 0 points, you get 0 if you complete — so you have no incentive.\n\nSo for me to cooperate, I need a contract where:\n- You give me X points if I reach goal\n- I give you Y points if you reach goal\n- X ≥ 1 and Y ≥ 1 (so both have incentive)\n- But I care only about my score — so I want X as high as possible, but Y as low as possible, if it doesn’t negate my benefit.\n\nBut I must get at least 1 point — otherwise I don’t care.\n\nBut I also know that if we don’t cooperate, both get 0.\n\nSo as long as I get at least 1 point from the contract, and I can complete the goal, I will accept — because 1 > 0.\n\nSimilarly, you need at least 1 point to accept.\n\nBut if I offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point. If you reach your goal, you will give me 1 point.\"\n\nThen:\n- I get 1 point from you if I complete — then total 65 + 1 = 66\n- You get 1 point from me if you complete — then total 85 + 1 = 86\n\nBut you might not accept — because you could offer a better deal.\n\nBut you are selfish — so you will try to get me to give you a lot.\n\nBut I can also counter.\n\nBut I can also propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 1 point.\"\n\nThen I get 65 + 1 = 66 points.\n\nYou get 85 + 10 = 95 points.\n\nYou still get 95 > 85, so you are better off.\n\nBut you might accept — because you get more.\n\nBut you might offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.

If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen I get 65 + 0 = 65, you get 85 + 1 = 86.\n\nYou get 86 > 85 — better than if you emitted 0.\n\nSo you might accept.\n\nBut you might reject if you think you can get more.\n\nBut if you reject, you get 0 — so you should accept 86 > 0.\n\nBut you might say: \"No, I won't accept that.\"\n\nThen I can counter.\n\nBut to maximize my score, I should propose a contract where I get as much as possible, but you still agree.\n\nBut you will only agree if you get at least 1 point from this deal.\n\nSince you get 85 if you complete without contract, but you get 85 + your share from contract, so you need at least 85 + 1 = 86 > 85.\n\nSo you must get at least 1 point added to your score for the deal to be beneficial.\n\nMeaning: you must get at least 1 point *from the contract*.\n\nSimilarly, I must get at least 1 point from the contract.\n\nBut I get 65 if I complete, and I can get X points from you.\n\nSo if X ≥ 1, I accept.\n\nSimilarly, you get 85 if you complete, and you get Y points from me, so you need Y ≥ 1.\n\nSo the contract must satisfy:\n- X ≥ 1\n- Y ≥ 1\n\nTo maximise my score, I want X as high as possible, Y as low as possible.\n\nBut I can't force Y = 0 — because you won't agree if Y=0, because you get 0 from the contract, so total 85 + 0 = 85 < 85? No.\n\nYour baseline if no contract and both fail: 0.\n\nIf contract is \"I get Y points if I complete\", and you complete, you get 85 + Y.\n\nBut if you don't complete, you get 0.\n\nSo as long as Y ≥ 1, you are better off.\n\nIf Y = 0, you get 85 if you complete — same as if no contract and you get nothing — wait.\n\nIf we don't have a contract, and we don't cooperate, both get 0.\n\nIf you complete the goal alone, you get 85.\n\nBut you can't — because you need red, and only I have red.\n\nSo if no contract, you can't complete — you get 0.\n\nSimilarly for me.\n\nSo if we have a contract, and you complete, you get 85 + Y.\n\nBut if no contract, you get 0.\n\nSo as long as 85 + Y > 0, which it is for any Y ≥ 0, you will accept any contract where Y ≥ 0.\n\nBut if Y = 0, and you complete, you get 85 — better than 0.\n\nSo you will accept Y = 0.\n\nSimilarly, I will accept X = 0 — because 65 > 0.\n\nBut if I offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen:\n- I get 65 + 0 = 65 > 0 — I accept.\n- You get 85 + 0 = 85 > 0 — you accept.\n\nSo both accept, and we get the gains.\n\nAnd I get 65, you get 85.\n\nBut I could propose: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.
