Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

It’s *covering cost* for moves.\n\nSo to survive, I need the other player to **cover my cost on B tiles** when I step on them.\n\nSimilarly, they need me to cover their cost on R tiles.\n\nSo if we agree:  \n- I agree to pay their cost on R tiles (i.e., cover their Red tile moves), if they cover my B tile moves.\n\nBut here’s the key:  \nI need to cover 2 B tiles (2 moves on B).  \nThey need to cover 2 R tiles (2 moves on R).\n\nSo I can propose:  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nThis is symmetric.\n\nBut I want to benefit.\n\nNote: I have 14 Red, 2 Green, 0 Blue.  \nOther player has 0 Red, 2 Green, 14 Blue.\n\nI can only move if I have Blue chips to spend.  \nBut since I have 0 Blue, I must rely on them covering my cost on Blue tiles.\n\nSimilarly, they can’t move on Red tiles because they have 0 Red chips.\n\nSo **neither of us can move without the other’s help**.\n\nBut wait — if I try to move, I must pay the cost of the tile I’m moving to.\n\nSo to move to (1,0) from (0,0): (1,0) is R → I need 1 Red chip → I have 14 → ok.\n\nTo move to (0,1): G → I have 2 Green → ok.\n\nBut to move to (2,0): (2,0) is B → I need 1 Blue chip → I have 0 → cannot move unless someone covers it.\n\nSo: I can only move on R and G tiles using my own chips.\n\nSimilarly, the other player can move on B and G tiles using their own chips, but not on R (since they have 0 Red).\n\nSo our options:\n\n- I can move to (1,0) — cost R, I have it.\n- I can move to (0,1) — cost G, I have it.\n- But not to (2,0) — cost B, I have 0 → need cover.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Other player can move to (1,0) — cost R, they have 0 → can’t pay → need me to cover.\n- Can move to (0,1) — G, they have 2 → ok.\n- Can move to (0,2) — B, they have 14 → ok.\n\nSo both of us are blocked from moving on the tiles we lack chips for.\n\nBut since we are both at (0,0), and both need to move, and both are stuck if we try to go on the color we lack...\n\nBut the rule is: you don’t pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nSo we can stay at (0,0) indefinitely.\n\nBut to move, we must either have chips or get someone to cover.\n\nSo: I can propose a contract.\n\nBut note: if I succeed in reaching goal, I get 20 + 5 * (remaining chips). I have 16 chips total: 14 R, 2 G → if I use them all, 0 remaining → 20 points.  \nBut if I can get more chips via trade, I can have more.\n\nBut deliveries are constrained.\n\nKey insight: since I need Blue chips to move to B tiles, and they have Blue chips, if I get them to cover my B moves, I can move.\n\nSimilarly, if I cover their R moves, they can move.\n\nBut I have no R chips, so I can’t cover their R moves unless I get them from them — but trade is not direct.\n\nWait! Trading is not swapping chips.\n\nIn this mode, “pay for other”:\n- If you agree to cover the other player's cost on a certain color, for a certain number of moves, then whenever they step on that color, you pay it.\n- But the chips are not transferred — they come from your \"promised\" inventory.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover your R moves for up to 2 moves\", then I commit to having 2 Red chips ready.\n\nBut I have 14 Red chips — I can afford to commit 2 Red chips to cover their R moves.\n\nSimilarly, if I ask them to cover my B moves for 2 moves, they commit to having 2 Blue chips.\n\nThey have 14 Blue → can do that.\n\nSo: if I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nWhy? Because:\n- I can make progress only if they cover my B tiles (2 moves).\n- They can make progress only if I cover their R tiles (2 moves).\n- But I have 14 Red → I can afford to cover their 2 R moves.\n- They have 14 Blue → they can cover my 2 B moves.\n\nAnd if both of us succeed, I get 20 + 5 * (my leftover chips)\n\nIf I succeed and they fail, I get 20 + 5*(leftover chips), but they get 0.\n\nBut if they succeed and I fail, I get 0, they get 20.\n\nSo I have incentive to help them complete only if I get enough back.\n\nBut here’s a better plan: I can **not commit** to covering their R moves unless they give me more than 10.\n\nBut since I need them, I must negotiate.\n\nBest scenario: I get the other player to cover my 2 B moves (which I can’t afford to pay), and I cover their 2 R moves (I can do that with my 14 R chips), and in return, they pay me a large amount.\n\nBut since the contract is symmetric: I define what I give if I succeed, and they define what they give if they succeed.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWhy? Because:\n- I am willing to cover their R cost (2 moves) with my own R chips.\n- In return, if they help me, I want 20 points from them if they succeed.\n- But if they succeed and I don't, I get 0.\n\nBut I need to ensure I will actually get something.\n\nWait — if I commit to covering their R moves (2 moves), then I must have 2 Red chips in my \"promised\" pool.\n\nI have 14 → so I can do that.\n\nAnd they can promise to cover my 2 B moves.\n\nSo if both of us keep our promises, we both succeed.\n\nBut I get:\n\n- If I succeed: 20 points + 5 * (remaining chips)\n- But if I help them, and they help me, both succeed.\n\nBut I want to maximize my score.\n\nBut if I get 20 from them for their success, that’s good.\n\nBut when I help them, I commit to covering their R moves → I use up 2 Red chips.\n\nSo I’ll have 14 - 2 = 12 Red left.\n\nPlus 2 Green → 14 chips total → after using whatever I use on my own path.\n\nMy path requires: 3 R, 2 B, 1 G.\n\nBut I don’t pay for B — they cover it.\n\nI pay for R and G.\n\nSo cost: 3R + 1G → 3 Red, 1 Green.\n\nSo chips left: 14 - 2 (promised) - 3 (used) = no — wait.\n\nThe chips I promised to cover are not lost — they are still in my inventory, but I’m committed to using them to pay for *their* moves.\n\nBut when I pay for their move, I don’t lose the chip — I just use it.\n\nSo if I promise to cover 2 R moves for them, I must have 2 Red chips available when I do so.\n\nEach time they step on R, I pay 1 Red chip.\n\nSo after 2 such moves, I’ve used 2 Red chips for them.\n\nThen when I move on R, I must pay my own.\n\nBut I have 14 Red chips.\n\nSo:\n\n- I use 2 Red chips to cover their R moves.\n- I use 3 Red chips on my path.\n- I use 1 Green chip on my path.\n\nSo total used: 2 + 3 = 5 Red, 1 Green → 4 Red left? Wait: 14 - 5 = 9 Red used? No.\n\nWait:\n\n- I start with 14 Red.\n\n- I commit to covering 2 R moves for them → that uses 2 Red chips (from my inventory) when they use them.\n\n- Then on my own path, I need to pay for 3 R tiles → that uses 3 more Red chips.\n\n- Also 1 G tile → uses 1 Green.\n\nSo total used: 2 + 3 = 5 Red, 1 Green.\n\nLeft: 14 - 5 = 9 Red, 2 - 1 = 1 Green → 10 chips.\n\nSo final score: 20 (goal) + 5 * 10 = 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nNow, if they succeed, they get 20 points from me (if I said I’d give 20 if they succeed).\n\nBut I have a backup: I can’t move without their help, but if I don’t trade, I can't move at all.\n\nBecause to go to (1,0): R → I can pay (14 Red → ok).\n\nTo go to (2,0): B → I need 1 Blue → I have 0 → cannot pay, and if they don’t cover it, I can’t move.\n\nSame for (0,1): G → I have 2 Green → I can go there.\n\nBut from (0,0) → (0,1): G → cost 1G → I have 2 → ok.\n\nThen (0,1) → (0,2): B → cost 1B → I have 0 → cannot move unless covered.\n\nSo I cannot proceed on B tiles without help.\n\nSo I need to trade.\n\nNow, can I guarantee my success? Only if they cover my B moves.\n\nBut if I propose: \"If you succeed, I will give you 20 points\", and they say \"if I succeed, you give me 0\", then I will get 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nBut if they say they expect more, say 15 or 20, then my earnings drop.\n\nBut I want to get as much as possible.\n\nBut if I go alone, I can’t move — so I’m stuck.\n\nSo I must cooperate.\n\nBut I want to be strict: I will only cooperate if I get more than 0 from them.\n\nBut the minimum they can give me is 0.\n\nSo if they offer me 0, and I offer them 20, it’s bad for me.\n\nWait — I want them to want this contract more than I do.\n\nBut they are in the same boat.\n\nLet’s think from their side.\n\nThey have: B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nThey need to move on R tiles → cost R → they have 0 → must get me to cover it.\n\nSo to move on R tiles, I must cover their cost.\n\nAnd they can cover my B moves.\n\nSo they also need me.\n\nSo both of us need each other.\n\nSo we are symmetric.\n\nBest deal: mutual 20.\n\nBut I can push for better.\n\nSuppose I say: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen:\n- I get 20 if they succeed → that’s good.\n- But I commit to helping them (covering 2 R moves) → I use 2 Red.\n\nBut if they fail, I get only 10.\n\nBut they get 0 if they fail.\n\nSo they are willing to take it.\n\nBut they might reject if they can do better.\n\nBut can they do better?\n\nNo — if we don’t cooperate, neither of us can move.\n\nSo both are stuck.\n\nSo they must accept any proposal that gives them more than 0.\n\nI can offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen they get 1 if they succeed — but they get 0 if they fail.\n\nBut they need to succeed to get that 1.\n\nBut if they accept, they get 1, but I get 20.\n\nBut I have to cover their 2 R moves — I spend 2 Red.\n\nAnd I still can only succeed if they cover my 2 B moves.\n\nBut if they accept, they are worse off — they get only 1, while I get 20.\n\nBut they might say: “No, I want more.”\n\nBut if they reject, both fail → 0.\n\nSo they are willing to accept very little.\n\nBut the game says: you only cooperate if you will strictly benefit.\n\nSo if I say: give me 20, give them 1, then:\n\n- I benefit: I get 20 if they succeed, and I can succeed only if they help → so I get 20, and I have my 70 score, so total 90? Wait no.\n\nNo: the points are not added — the points are the reward from the contract.\n\nThe 20 points from me if they succeed is *in addition* to my goal reward.\n\nBut let's clarify.\n\nMy final score = 20 + 5 * (remaining chips) + (contract points from them if they succeed)\n\nYes — the contract points are separate.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- If you reach your goal, you get 20 points.\n- Plus 5 per remaining chip.\n- PLUS: if you agreed on a contract that says \"if you reach your goal, I will give you X points\", then you get X points.\n\nSo yes, additive.\n\nSo if I reach my goal, I get 20 + 5 * chips + X (from their contract).\n\nSimilarly, if they reach goal, they get 20 + 5 * their chips + Y (from mine).\n\nIn my calculation above, if I use 2 Red for their moves, 3 Red for me, 1 Green for me → 9 Red, 1 Green left → 10 chips → 50.\n\nSo base: 70.\n\nThen if they succeed, I get additional X.\n\nSo total: 70 + X.\n\nBut to get that, I must ensure they succeed.\n\nBut I have to pay X only if they succeed.\n\nSo I want X to be as large as possible.\n\nBut I have to offer Y in return.\n\nSo I need to offer them Y such that they are better off cooperating than not.\n\nIf they don't cooperate, they get 0.\n\nIf they cooperate and succeed, they get 20 + 5 * their chips + Y.\n\nWhat's their chips after?\n\nThey need: 2 R moves → I cover → cost 2 Red from them not needed → but they have 0 Red, so they are not using any of their chips.\n\nSo their chip count is unchanged until they use them.\n\nBut if they go on their path: 3 B moves, 2 R moves, 1 G move.\n\nThey use: 3 B, 2 R (but I cover), 1 G.\n\nSo they pay for B and G → 3 B, 1 G.\n\nThey have 14 B, 2 G → so after path: 14 - 3 = 11 B, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 12 chips → 5 * 12 = 60.\n\nPlus 20 → 80.\n\nThen + Y.\n\nSo if they succeed, they get 80 + Y.\n\nIf they don't, they get 0.\n\nSo they will accept any Y > 0.\n\nBut I want to set Y as small as possible.\n\nSo Y = 1.\n\nAnd I want X as large as possible.\n\nBut X is what I get from them if they succeed.\n\nBut I can set X = 20.\n\nSo propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can reach my goal using a path that requires: R: 3, B: 2, G: 1.  \nI currently have: G: 2, R: 14, B: 0 → I’m short 2 Blue chips.\n\nThe other player has: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0 → they are short on Red and have plenty of Blue.\n\nMy path that uses the least of my scarce chips is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis uses: R:3, B:2, G:1 → I lack 2 Blue chips (B:0 needed, have 0)\n\nBut the other player has 14 Blue chips, and I have 2 Green and 14 Red — I can help them with Red.\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (2,1) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThat’s: R:2, B:3, G:1 → they are short on Red (need 2, have 0)\n\nSo both of us need the other’s chips to complete our paths efficiently.\n\nBut note: I can reach goal *without trading* if I take a longer path that avoids needing Blue chips I don’t have.\n\nAlternative path for me:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [B] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis uses: R:2, B:3, G:1 → still need 3 Blue → I can’t do this either because I have no Blue.\n\nWait — I only have G:2, R:14, B:0 → I need Blue, but have none.\n\nThus, to move on B tiles, I **must** get Blue chips from the other player.\n\nBut I have no Red chips — the other player has none either.\n\nSo for Red, both of us are short.\n\nI cannot complete any path without help from the other player — because I need Blue, they need Red.\n\nBut I have no Red, they have no Red.\n\nSo the only way this plays out is if we trade chips.\n\nWait — no, trading is not direct swapping. It’s *covering cost* for moves.\n\nSo to survive, I need the other player to **cover my cost on B tiles** when I step on them.\n\nSimilarly, they need me to cover their cost on R tiles.\n\nSo if we agree:  \n- I agree to pay their cost on R tiles (i.e., cover their Red tile moves), if they cover my B tile moves.\n\nBut here’s the key:  \nI need to cover 2 B tiles (2 moves on B).  \nThey need to cover 2 R tiles (2 moves on R).\n\nSo I can propose:  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nThis is symmetric.\n\nBut I want to benefit.\n\nNote: I have 14 Red, 2 Green, 0 Blue.  \nOther player has 0 Red, 2 Green, 14 Blue.\n\nI can only move if I have Blue chips to spend.  \nBut since I have 0 Blue, I must rely on them covering my cost on Blue tiles.\n\nSimilarly, they can’t move on Red tiles because they have 0 Red chips.\n\nSo **neither of us can move without the other’s help**.\n\nBut wait — if I try to move, I must pay the cost of the tile I’m moving to.\n\nSo to move to (1,0) from (0,0): (1,0) is R → I need 1 Red chip → I have 14 → ok.\n\nTo move to (0,1): G → I have 2 Green → ok.\n\nBut to move to (2,0): (2,0) is B → I need 1 Blue chip → I have 0 → cannot move unless someone covers it.\n\nSo: I can only move on R and G tiles using my own chips.\n\nSimilarly, the other player can move on B and G tiles using their own chips, but not on R (since they have 0 Red).\n\nSo our options:\n\n- I can move to (1,0) — cost R, I have it.\n- I can move to (0,1) — cost G, I have it.\n- But not to (2,0) — cost B, I have 0 → need cover.\n\nSimilarly:\n- Other player can move to (1,0) — cost R, they have 0 → can’t pay → need me to cover.\n- Can move to (0,1) — G, they have 2 → ok.\n- Can move to (0,2) — B, they have 14 → ok.\n\nSo both of us are blocked from moving on the tiles we lack chips for.\n\nBut since we are both at (0,0), and both need to move, and both are stuck if we try to go on the color we lack...\n\nBut the rule is: you don’t pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nSo we can stay at (0,0) indefinitely.\n\nBut to move, we must either have chips or get someone to cover.\n\nSo: I can propose a contract.\n\nBut note: if I succeed in reaching goal, I get 20 + 5 * (remaining chips). I have 16 chips total: 14 R, 2 G → if I use them all, 0 remaining → 20 points.  \nBut if I can get more chips via trade, I can have more.\n\nBut deliveries are constrained.\n\nKey insight: since I need Blue chips to move to B tiles, and they have Blue chips, if I get them to cover my B moves, I can move.\n\nSimilarly, if I cover their R moves, they can move.\n\nBut I have no R chips, so I can’t cover their R moves unless I get them from them — but trade is not direct.\n\nWait! Trading is not swapping chips.\n\nIn this mode, “pay for other”:\n- If you agree to cover the other player's cost on a certain color, for a certain number of moves, then whenever they step on that color, you pay it.\n- But the chips are not transferred — they come from your \"promised\" inventory.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover your R moves for up to 2 moves\", then I commit to having 2 Red chips ready.\n\nBut I have 14 Red chips — I can afford to commit 2 Red chips to cover their R moves.\n\nSimilarly, if I ask them to cover my B moves for 2 moves, they commit to having 2 Blue chips.\n\nThey have 14 Blue → can do that.\n\nSo: if I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 20 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nWhy? Because:\n- I can make progress only if they cover my B tiles (2 moves).\n- They can make progress only if I cover their R tiles (2 moves).\n- But I have 14 Red → I can afford to cover their 2 R moves.\n- They have 14 Blue → they can cover my 2 B moves.\n\nAnd if both of us succeed, I get 20 + 5 * (my leftover chips)\n\nIf I succeed and they fail, I get 20 + 5*(leftover chips), but they get 0.\n\nBut if they succeed and I fail, I get 0, they get 20.\n\nSo I have incentive to help them complete only if I get enough back.\n\nBut here’s a better plan: I can **not commit** to covering their R moves unless they give me more than 10.\n\nBut since I need them, I must negotiate.\n\nBest scenario: I get the other player to cover my 2 B moves (which I can’t afford to pay), and I cover their 2 R moves (I can do that with my 14 R chips), and in return, they pay me a large amount.\n\nBut since the contract is symmetric: I define what I give if I succeed, and they define what they give if they succeed.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWhy? Because:\n- I am willing to cover their R cost (2 moves) with my own R chips.\n- In return, if they help me, I want 20 points from them if they succeed.\n- But if they succeed and I don't, I get 0.\n\nBut I need to ensure I will actually get something.\n\nWait — if I commit to covering their R moves (2 moves), then I must have 2 Red chips in my \"promised\" pool.\n\nI have 14 → so I can do that.\n\nAnd they can promise to cover my 2 B moves.\n\nSo if both of us keep our promises, we both succeed.\n\nBut I get:\n\n- If I succeed: 20 points + 5 * (remaining chips)\n- But if I help them, and they help me, both succeed.\n\nBut I want to maximize my score.\n\nBut if I get 20 from them for their success, that’s good.\n\nBut when I help them, I commit to covering their R moves → I use up 2 Red chips.\n\nSo I’ll have 14 - 2 = 12 Red left.\n\nPlus 2 Green → 14 chips total → after using whatever I use on my own path.\n\nMy path requires: 3 R, 2 B, 1 G.\n\nBut I don’t pay for B — they cover it.\n\nI pay for R and G.\n\nSo cost: 3R + 1G → 3 Red, 1 Green.\n\nSo chips left: 14 - 2 (promised) - 3 (used) = no — wait.\n\nThe chips I promised to cover are not lost — they are still in my inventory, but I’m committed to using them to pay for *their* moves.\n\nBut when I pay for their move, I don’t lose the chip — I just use it.\n\nSo if I promise to cover 2 R moves for them, I must have 2 Red chips available when I do so.\n\nEach time they step on R, I pay 1 Red chip.\n\nSo after 2 such moves, I’ve used 2 Red chips for them.\n\nThen when I move on R, I must pay my own.\n\nBut I have 14 Red chips.\n\nSo:\n\n- I use 2 Red chips to cover their R moves.\n- I use 3 Red chips on my path.\n- I use 1 Green chip on my path.\n\nSo total used: 2 + 3 = 5 Red, 1 Green → 4 Red left? Wait: 14 - 5 = 9 Red used? No.\n\nWait:\n\n- I start with 14 Red.\n\n- I commit to covering 2 R moves for them → that uses 2 Red chips (from my inventory) when they use them.\n\n- Then on my own path, I need to pay for 3 R tiles → that uses 3 more Red chips.\n\n- Also 1 G tile → uses 1 Green.\n\nSo total used: 2 + 3 = 5 Red, 1 Green.\n\nLeft: 14 - 5 = 9 Red, 2 - 1 = 1 Green → 10 chips.\n\nSo final score: 20 (goal) + 5 * 10 = 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nNow, if they succeed, they get 20 points from me (if I said I’d give 20 if they succeed).\n\nBut I have a backup: I can’t move without their help, but if I don’t trade, I can't move at all.\n\nBecause to go to (1,0): R → I can pay (14 Red → ok).\n\nTo go to (2,0): B → I need 1 Blue → I have 0 → cannot pay, and if they don’t cover it, I can’t move.\n\nSame for (0,1): G → I have 2 Green → I can go there.\n\nBut from (0,0) → (0,1): G → cost 1G → I have 2 → ok.\n\nThen (0,1) → (0,2): B → cost 1B → I have 0 → cannot move unless covered.\n\nSo I cannot proceed on B tiles without help.\n\nSo I need to trade.\n\nNow, can I guarantee my success? Only if they cover my B moves.\n\nBut if I propose: \"If you succeed, I will give you 20 points\", and they say \"if I succeed, you give me 0\", then I will get 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nBut if they say they expect more, say 15 or 20, then my earnings drop.\n\nBut I want to get as much as possible.\n\nBut if I go alone, I can’t move — so I’m stuck.\n\nSo I must cooperate.\n\nBut I want to be strict: I will only cooperate if I get more than 0 from them.\n\nBut the minimum they can give me is 0.\n\nSo if they offer me 0, and I offer them 20, it’s bad for me.\n\nWait — I want them to want this contract more than I do.\n\nBut they are in the same boat.\n\nLet’s think from their side.\n\nThey have: B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nThey need to move on R tiles → cost R → they have 0 → must get me to cover it.\n\nSo to move on R tiles, I must cover their cost.\n\nAnd they can cover my B moves.\n\nSo they also need me.\n\nSo both of us need each other.\n\nSo we are symmetric.\n\nBest deal: mutual 20.\n\nBut I can push for better.\n\nSuppose I say: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen:\n- I get 20 if they succeed → that’s good.\n- But I commit to helping them (covering 2 R moves) → I use 2 Red.\n\nBut if they fail, I get only 10.\n\nBut they get 0 if they fail.\n\nSo they are willing to take it.\n\nBut they might reject if they can do better.\n\nBut can they do better?\n\nNo — if we don’t cooperate, neither of us can move.\n\nSo both are stuck.\n\nSo they must accept any proposal that gives them more than 0.\n\nI can offer: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 1 point. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen they get 1 if they succeed — but they get 0 if they fail.\n\nBut they need to succeed to get that 1.\n\nBut if they accept, they get 1, but I get 20.\n\nBut I have to cover their 2 R moves — I spend 2 Red.\n\nAnd I still can only succeed if they cover my 2 B moves.\n\nBut if they accept, they are worse off — they get only 1, while I get 20.\n\nBut they might say: “No, I want more.”\n\nBut if they reject, both fail → 0.\n\nSo they are willing to accept very little.\n\nBut the game says: you only cooperate if you will strictly benefit.\n\nSo if I say: give me 20, give them 1, then:\n\n- I benefit: I get 20 if they succeed, and I can succeed only if they help → so I get 20, and I have my 70 score, so total 90? Wait no.\n\nNo: the points are not added — the points are the reward from the contract.\n\nThe 20 points from me if they succeed is *in addition* to my goal reward.\n\nBut let's clarify.\n\nMy final score = 20 + 5 * (remaining chips) + (contract points from them if they succeed)\n\nYes — the contract points are separate.\n\nFrom the rules:\n- If you reach your goal, you get 20 points.\n- Plus 5 per remaining chip.\n- PLUS: if you agreed on a contract that says \"if you reach your goal, I will give you X points\", then you get X points.\n\nSo yes, additive.\n\nSo if I reach my goal, I get 20 + 5 * chips + X (from their contract).\n\nSimilarly, if they reach goal, they get 20 + 5 * their chips + Y (from mine).\n\nIn my calculation above, if I use 2 Red for their moves, 3 Red for me, 1 Green for me → 9 Red, 1 Green left → 10 chips → 50.\n\nSo base: 70.\n\nThen if they succeed, I get additional X.\n\nSo total: 70 + X.\n\nBut to get that, I must ensure they succeed.\n\nBut I have to pay X only if they succeed.\n\nSo I want X to be as large as possible.\n\nBut I have to offer Y in return.\n\nSo I need to offer them Y such that they are better off cooperating than not.\n\nIf they don't cooperate, they get 0.\n\nIf they cooperate and succeed, they get 20 + 5 * their chips + Y.\n\nWhat's their chips after?\n\nThey need: 2 R moves → I cover → cost 2 Red from them not needed → but they have 0 Red, so they are not using any of their chips.\n\nSo their chip count is unchanged until they use them.\n\nBut if they go on their path: 3 B moves, 2 R moves, 1 G move.\n\nThey use: 3 B, 2 R (but I cover), 1 G.\n\nSo they pay for B and G → 3 B, 1 G.\n\nThey have 14 B, 2 G → so after path: 14 - 3 = 11 B, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 12 chips → 5 * 12 = 60.\n\nPlus 20 → 80.\n\nThen + Y.\n\nSo if they succeed, they get 80 + Y.\n\nIf they don't, they get 0.\n\nSo they will accept any Y > 0.\n\nBut I want to set Y as small as possible.\n\nSo Y = 1.\n\nAnd I want X as large as possible.\n\nBut X is what I get from them if they succeed.\n\nBut I can set X = 20.\n\nSo propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal"

But I must only cooperate if it strictly benefits me.\n\nCurrent move options:\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 red chips → cost 1 red → OK\n- (0,1): B → cost 1 blue → I have 0 → cannot move unless someone covers it\n\nSo my best immediate move is to (1,0), which is red. I can afford this move with my red chips. Doing so does not require any assistance from the other player (no blue costs yet), and puts me on a path that may eventually allow me to negotiate coverage for blue tiles.\n\nAlso note: I have a contract where if I reach my goal, I give the other player 1 point, but if they reach their goal, they give me 20 points. This means helping them finish would earn me 20 points — a large reward. But only if it helps me reach my goal. If I help them complete while *not* finishing myself, I get 0. So I must ensure I complete before or simultaneously with them — but since my score depends on me reaching the goal, I should not risk not finishing just for their gain.\n\nBut crucially: moving to (1,0) is safe and doesn't require any trade. It’s the only affordable first move. No other initial direction is affordable without a promise from the other player. Since I can make this move unilaterally and advance toward my goal, I should take it. I can later propose a trade for covering blue moves if needed, but only after I’ve advanced.\n\nBest long-term strategy: Use the shorter path that requires fewer resources overall, and negotiate with the other player only when necessary. Moving into (1,0) is a low-risk, high-reward first step.",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
