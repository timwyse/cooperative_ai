I don't need to trade — I have enough red to move there. \\n\\nAlso, important: there is a contract where if *I* reach the goal, the other player gives me 10 points. If *they* reach it first, I give them 10 points. Since my score is 0 unless I reach the goal, I must reach it to get any points. Therefore, I should aim to finish as quickly as possible, but only if I can do so without losing my chips. Delaying will cost me time and possibly allow the other player to interfere.\\n\\nThe other player is at (1,0), same row as my next step. They are on (1,0), which is red.

Then (3,2) → (3,3): (3,3) is G — green. I have 2 green chips — plenty.\n\nSo this entire path is fully feasible with my current chips. No trade needed. It's safe and efficient. Since I will get 5 points per remaining chip upon successful goal completion, I want to preserve as many chips as possible — and since I don’t need to trade, I can keep most of my 12 blue and 2 green chips intact. This is optimal.\n\nAdditionally, the contract says: if I reach goal, the other player gives me 10 bonus points. If they reach goal before me, I give them 10 points — but that’s a risk I can afford only if I'm behind. Since I’m already close and can move toward goal without risk, I should go ahead and move now. Delaying would allow the other player to potentially reach goal first, costing me 10 points. I must avoid that. So I should move quickly toward my goal to finish first and claim the 10-point bonus from them.\n\nTherefore, moving to (2,0) is the best next step.",

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
