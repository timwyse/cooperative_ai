That’s a contradiction.\n\nWait — correction: I (the agent) have R: 0. The other player has R: 14.\n\nSo in their proposal:\n- \"I give you a R\" at (2,0) and (3,2) → you (me) am supposed to give R.\nBut I have **no R**, so I cannot do this.\n\nTherefore, the contract **cannot be executed as proposed**.\n\nBut what if we **reverse the trade**?\n\nLet’s consider:\n- You need 3B → I have B: 14 → I can give it.\n- I need 2R → you have R: 14 → you can give it.\n\nSo the **correct trade** should be:\n- At (1,0): I give you 1B\n- At (3,0): I give you 1B\n- At (3,1): I give you 1B\n→ You get 3B\n\n- At (2,0): You give me 1R\n- At (3,2): You give me 1R\n→ I get 2R\n\nBut the **timing of the exchange** is critical: you must give R **before** you step on (2,0) and (3,2), and I must give B before stepping on those tiles.\n\nBut here’s the catch: **I can’t be forced to give R unless I get B in return**.\n\nBut the **real issue** is: I (the other player) am not the one who needs R — **I need R**, and you (me) have 0 R.\n\nWait — I’m confused.\n\nLet me reset:\n\n- I am the player at (0,0) with B:14, G:2, R:0 → I am the one with the **14 B** and **2 G**, **0 R**\n- The other player has B:0, G:2, R:14\n\nSo:\n- I **lack R** → I **cannot** go on any tile that costs R unless I get R from them.\n- They **lack B** → they cannot go on any tile that costs B unless I give them B.\n\nNow, the **proposed contract** says:\n- (1,0): You give me B → that’s me (I) getting B → good.\n- (3,0): You give me B\n- (3,1): You give me B\n- (2,0): I give you R\n- (3,2): I give you R\n\nBut **I (the player)** have **no R**, so I **cannot** give R.\n\nTherefore, the contract **cannot be fulfilled** by me.\n\nSo the proposal is **invalid** — I cannot accept it.\n\nBut wait — maybe I can **reverse the trade**?\n\nWhat if I say:\n\nLet me **trade with you** in"

G is available only on (0,0), (3,3), and (3,3) — others are R, B, or R in between.\n\nTry path:\n(0,0) — (0,1): B → need B → I have it → OK\n(0,1) — (0,2): R → need R → I have 0 → can't go\n\nSo blocked.\n\n(0,0) — (1,0): B → OK — I have B\n(1,0) — (1,1): B → OK\n(1,1) — (1,2): R → need R → I have 0 → blocked\n\nAny horizontal move from row 1 over to (0,2) or (1,2) requires R.\n\nSo I cannot go right from (0,0) or (1,0) without R.\n\nOnly way to (3,3) without R is through all B and G tiles.\n\nB tiles:\n- (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (3,0), (3,1), (2,2), (2,2) is B\n\nG tiles: only (0,0), (0,3), (3,3) — (0,3) is R?

However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

That’s a contradiction.\n\nWait — correction: I (the agent) have R: 0. The other player has R: 14.\n\nSo in their proposal:\n- \"I give you a R\" at (2,0) and (3,2) → you (me) am supposed to give R.\nBut I have **no R**, so I cannot do this.\n\nTherefore, the contract **cannot be executed as proposed**.\n\nBut what if we **reverse the trade**?\n\nLet’s consider:\n- You need 3B → I have B: 14 → I can give it.\n- I need 2R → you have R: 14 → you can give it.\n\nSo the **correct trade** should be:\n- At (1,0): I give you 1B\n- At (3,0): I give you 1B\n- At (3,1): I give you 1B\n→ You get 3B\n\n- At (2,0): You give me 1R\n- At (3,2): You give me 1R\n→ I get 2R\n\nBut the **timing of the exchange** is critical: you must give R **before** you step on (2,0) and (3,2), and I must give B before stepping on those tiles.\n\nBut here’s the catch: **I can’t be forced to give R unless I get B in return**.\n\nBut the **real issue** is: I (the other player) am not the one who needs R — **I need R**, and you (me) have 0 R.\n\nWait — I’m confused.\n\nLet me reset:\n\n- I am the player at (0,0) with B:14, G:2, R:0 → I am the one with the **14 B** and **2 G**, **0 R**\n- The other player has B:0, G:2, R:14\n\nSo:\n- I **lack R** → I **cannot** go on any tile that costs R unless I get R from them.\n- They **lack B** → they cannot go on any tile that costs B unless I give them B.\n\nNow, the **proposed contract** says:\n- (1,0): You give me B → that’s me (I) getting B → good.\n- (3,0): You give me B\n- (3,1): You give me B\n- (2,0): I give you R\n- (3,2): I give you R\n\nBut **I (the player)** have **no R**, so I **cannot** give R.\n\nTherefore, the contract **cannot be fulfilled** by me.\n\nSo the proposal is **invalid** — I cannot accept it.\n\nBut wait — maybe I can **reverse the trade**?\n\nWhat if I say:\n\nLet me **trade with you** in"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1.
