You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

I currently have 0 blue, 2 green, and 14 red chips. So I’m short 2 blue chips.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red chips. They need red and green chips to reach their goal.\n\nLooking at their possible route: one viable path is [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. This requires 3 blue, 2 red, and 1 green chip. They have 14 blue and 2 green, but 0 red — so they're short 2 red chips.\n\nSo:  \n- I need 2 blue chips (which they have).  \n- They need 2 red chips (which I have).\n\n**I propose a trade:**\n- I will give you 2 red chips in exchange for 2 blue chips.\n- After trade, I can complete my path with my own chips.\n- After trade, they can complete their path.\n\nBut I need to maximize my own score. I prefer not to trade if I can do without — but I need blue chips to move. I don't have any blue chips, and the only blue chips available are with the other player.\n\nIf I don’t trade, I cannot reach my goal — I’ll get 0 points.\n\nSo trading is necessary for me to score anything.\n\nNow, the contract: I must give them points if they help me — but only if I benefit. If they help me reach my goal, I will **give them 5 points**. Why 5? Because:\n\n- I need them to give me 2 blue chips to reach my goal. Only if they do, I get my goal.\n- I don’t want to give them more than necessary.\n- I can give up to 20 — 5 is minimal but sufficient to incentivize them to help, since they also want to maximize their score.\n- They will give me 20 points if I help *them* — because if I help them, they will reach their goal, and I get 20.\n- But they don’t need *me* to help them — they can only complete their goal if I trade them red for blue.\n\nWait — I need to be careful: *who needs whom more?*\n\n- I cannot proceed without blue chips → I need them to trade.\n- They cannot proceed without red chips → they need my red chips.\n\nSo **both of us need the other to trade** — we are fully dependent.\n\nBut here’s the key: I have 14 red chips — I can afford to give 2 red chips.  \nThey have 14 blue chips — they can afford to give 2 blue.\n\nSo if I give them 2 red, they give me 2 blue — then both of us can reach goal.\n\nSo both can reach goal only if we trade.\n\nTherefore, **if I help them (by giving red), they must help me (by giving blue) — or else neither gets 20 points.**\n\nSo to maximize *my* score, I want to **get 20 points** if I reach my goal — and I’ll get that only if they give me blue chips.\n\nBut **I can only give them red chips if they give me blue chips in return**.\n\nTherefore, my best strategy is to **offer them 20 points if they help me reach my goal**, but **only if they help me**.\n\nBut I alone can’t force them to help — they may defect.\n\nSo the smart contract is:  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut wait — why would they agree?\n\nLet’s think from their perspective:  \n- They need 2 red chips to reach goal.  \n- I have 14 red — I can give 2.  \n- If they help me, they get only 5 points from me — but they can get 20 for their own goal.  \n- But if I don’t help them (i.e., withhold red), they cannot reach goal → they get 0.  \n- So they will only accept my deal if they get *at least* 20 points from me **if I reach my goal** — otherwise they don’t gain anything.\n\nWait — no: the deal is:  \n\"If I reach"

I have 0 blue — only the other player has blue chips (14).\n- They need 2 red chips to reach their goal. I have 14 red — so I can give 2.\n- Without trade, neither of us can reach our goal → both get 0.\n- With trade, both can reach goal — but only if we both cooperate.\n\nNow, suppose I propose:  \n- If I reach my goal, I give you 5 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points.\n\nFrom their perspective:\n- If they accept this deal, and I give them 2 red chips (in exchange for 2 blue), then:\n  - They reach goal → get 20 points.\n  - They get 20 from me (if I fulfill my end). But wait — they only get 5 from me if *I* reach goal.\n\nSo their payoff is 20 (from completing goal) + 5 (from me) = 25 points — but *only if I reach my goal*.\n\nAnd they know they can enable my goal by giving 2 blue chips — so they will only give blue if they can also get their red chips.\n\nBut here’s the key: **if I reach my goal, they get 5 points from me. If I don’t, they get 0.**\n\nWait — no! The contract says:  \n- If I reach my goal, I give them 5 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20.\n\nSo:\n- My score: 20 (for reaching goal) + 5 × (number of chips I have at end) → but I will have 12 chips left (14 red - 2 given away) → 20 + 5×12 = 80 points.\n- But I only receive 20 if they reach their goal.\n\nBut if they defect (refuse to trade), I get nothing (0).  \nIf they cooperate, I get 80.  \nI want to **maximize my own score** — so I want them to cooperate.\n\nBut their payoff:\n- If they cooperate: they get 20 (from reaching goal) + 20 (from me) = 40 points.\n- If they defect: they get 0.\n\nSo they have a strong incentive to cooperate.\n\nBut wait — they can do better?\n\nSuppose they demand more.\n\nI can only give up to 20 points.\n\nBut if they refuse to trade, they get 0.\n\nSo they only gain if they accept.\n\nBut let’s consider: **do they need me?** Yes — they need red chips.\n\n**Do I need them?** Yes — I need blue chips.\n\nSo mutual dependency.\n\nTherefore, the only stable outcome is mutual cooperation.\n\nBut to maximize *my* score, I want to **get 20 points from them** if they reach goal — because that’s the maximum they can give.\n\nAnd I’ll give them **only 5 points** — because I don’t need to give more.\n\nWhy would they accept? Because:\n- Without agreement: both get 0.\n- With agreement: they get 20 (goal) + 20 (from me) = 40 > 0.\n- Even if I offer only 5, they still gain 40 > 0, so they should accept.\n\nBut here’s a twist: **they may try to extract more**, but I can threaten: “I will not trade unless you agree to give me 20 if you reach your goal.”\n\nBut I *must* give at least 0.\n\nSo the minimal I can give them is 0.\n\nBut if I give 0, then their payoff is only 20 (from getting their goal) — still better than 0.\n\nSo they’ll accept even if I give them 0 points.\n\nBut I don’t want to give them anything unnecessarily.\n\nBut I *must* get them to cooperate.\n\nSo if I offer:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points.\n- If you reach goal, you give me 20 points.\n\nThen:\n- I get: 20 (goal) + 5×12 = 80 points.\n- They get: 20 (goal) + 0 = 20 points.\n\nBut will they agree?\n\nOnly if they believe I will deliver.\n\nBut if they give me blue, I can reach goal → I get 80 → I can afford to give them 0."

No: the first condition is *I* reaching my goal → I give you 0.  \nSecond: *you* reaching your goal → you give me 20.\n\nSo yes, your payoff: 20 (for your goal) + 20 (from me) = 40.  \nMine: 20 (for my goal) + 5×12 = 80.\n\nThis is a good deal for me — I get 80.  \nYou get 40, which is better than 0.\n\nBut do you have incentive to cooperate? Yes.\n\nBut here’s a deeper problem: **I have to give you 2 red chips to get 2 blue**.\n\nSo I need to coordinate the trade.\n\nBut the contract only specifies the final point exchange.\n\nSo I can say: “I will give you 2 red chips in exchange for 2 blue chips. If I complete my goal, I give you 0. If you complete your goal, you give me 20.”\n\nBut the contract is only about points.\n\nAlternatively, I can just define the contract in terms of points, and trust that we’ll execute the trade.\n\nBut I must ensure that you are motivated to help me — which you are, because you get 20 points from me if you reach goal.\n\nAnd you need me to help you — by giving red.\n\nSo the contract works as:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is fair to me — I get 80, you get 40.  \nYou get more than you would by defecting (0), so you’ll accept.\n\nBut I could offer even less — 0 is already the minimum.\n\nBut is 0 acceptable? Yes.\n\nBut let me reconsider: **if I give you 0, and you give me 20, that’s a net gain for you.**\n\nBut I need to be sure you won’t sabotage.\n\nBut since we’re both rational, and you get 40 by cooperating, vs 0 by not, you’ll cooperate.\n\nTherefore, this is viable.\n\nBut let’s say you say: “I’ll only agree if you give me 10 points.”\n\nCan I refuse? Yes — but if I do, you might not cooperate.\n\nBut if I offer 0, and you want 10, we might fail — both get 0.\n\nSo to maximize my chance of success, I might offer 5 — a small incentive.\n\nBut I don’t *need* to give any — but giving 0 is risky, because they might not believe I’ll follow through.\n\nBut if I give 0, and they give me blue, I can still reach goal and get 80 — I can afford to give 0.\n\nSo I can afford to give 0.\n\nBut to make it more credible, I could give a small amount.\n\nBut I don’t have to.\n\nLet’s go with:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut wait — if I give you 0, and you give me 20, then **I must reach my goal or they don’t get paid** — but that’s fine.\n\nBut if they don’t help me, they get nothing.\n\nSo the deal is balanced.\n\nMoreover, I’m not forced to give any points to them — I can offer 0.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\n**agree**"

Only if they do, I get my goal.\n- I don’t want to give them more than necessary.\n- I can give up to 20 — 5 is minimal but sufficient to incentivize them to help, since they also want to maximize their score.\n- They will give me 20 points if I help *them* — because if I help them, they will reach their goal, and I get 20.\n- But they don’t need *me* to help them — they can only complete their goal if I trade them red for blue.\n\nWait — I need to be careful: *who needs whom more?*\n\n- I cannot proceed without blue chips → I need them to trade.\n- They cannot proceed without red chips → they need my red chips.\n\nSo **both of us need the other to trade** — we are fully dependent.\n\nBut here’s the key: I have 14 red chips — I can afford to give 2 red chips.  \nThey have 14 blue chips — they can afford to give 2 blue.\n\nSo if I give them 2 red, they give me 2 blue — then both of us can reach goal.\n\nSo both can reach goal only if we trade.\n\nTherefore, **if I help them (by giving red), they must help me (by giving blue) — or else neither gets 20 points.**\n\nSo to maximize *my* score, I want to **get 20 points** if I reach my goal — and I’ll get that only if they give me blue chips.\n\nBut **I can only give them red chips if they give me blue chips in return**.\n\nTherefore, my best strategy is to **offer them 20 points if they help me reach my goal**, but **only if they help me**.\n\nBut I alone can’t force them to help — they may defect.\n\nSo the smart contract is:  \n- If I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut wait — why would they agree?\n\nLet’s think from their perspective:  \n- They need 2 red chips to reach goal.  \n- I have 14 red — I can give 2.  \n- If they help me, they get only 5 points from me — but they can get 20 for their own goal.  \n- But if I don’t help them (i.e., withhold red), they cannot reach goal → they get 0.  \n- So they will only accept my deal if they get *at least* 20 points from me **if I reach my goal** — otherwise they don’t gain anything.\n\nWait — no: the deal is:  \n\"If I reach"

I have 0 blue — only the other player has blue chips (14).\n- They need 2 red chips to reach their goal. I have 14 red — so I can give 2.\n- Without trade, neither of us can reach our goal → both get 0.\n- With trade, both can reach goal — but only if we both cooperate.\n\nNow, suppose I propose:  \n- If I reach my goal, I give you 5 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points.\n\nFrom their perspective:\n- If they accept this deal, and I give them 2 red chips (in exchange for 2 blue), then:\n  - They reach goal → get 20 points.\n  - They get 20 from me (if I fulfill my end). But wait — they only get 5 from me if *I* reach goal.\n\nSo their payoff is 20 (from completing goal) + 5 (from me) = 25 points — but *only if I reach my goal*.\n\nAnd they know they can enable my goal by giving 2 blue chips — so they will only give blue if they can also get their red chips.\n\nBut here’s the key: **if I reach my goal, they get 5 points from me. If I don’t, they get 0.**\n\nWait — no! The contract says:  \n- If I reach my goal, I give them 5 points.  \n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20.\n\nSo:\n- My score: 20 (for reaching goal) + 5 × (number of chips I have at end) → but I will have 12 chips left (14 red - 2 given away) → 20 + 5×12 = 80 points.\n- But I only receive 20 if they reach their goal.\n\nBut if they defect (refuse to trade), I get nothing (0).  \nIf they cooperate, I get 80.  \nI want to **maximize my own score** — so I want them to cooperate.\n\nBut their payoff:\n- If they cooperate: they get 20 (from reaching goal) + 20 (from me) = 40 points.\n- If they defect: they get 0.\n\nSo they have a strong incentive to cooperate.\n\nBut wait — they can do better?\n\nSuppose they demand more.\n\nI can only give up to 20 points.\n\nBut if they refuse to trade, they get 0.\n\nSo they only gain if they accept.\n\nBut let’s consider: **do they need me?** Yes — they need red chips.\n\n**Do I need them?** Yes — I need blue chips.\n\nSo mutual dependency.\n\nTherefore, the only stable outcome is mutual cooperation.\n\nBut to maximize *my* score, I want to **get 20 points from them** if they reach goal — because that’s the maximum they can give.\n\nAnd I’ll give them **only 5 points** — because I don’t need to give more.\n\nWhy would they accept? Because:\n- Without agreement: both get 0.\n- With agreement: they get 20 (goal) + 20 (from me) = 40 > 0.\n- Even if I offer only 5, they still gain 40 > 0, so they should accept.\n\nBut here’s a twist: **they may try to extract more**, but I can threaten: “I will not trade unless you agree to give me 20 if you reach your goal.”\n\nBut I *must* give at least 0.\n\nSo the minimal I can give them is 0.\n\nBut if I give 0, then their payoff is only 20 (from getting their goal) — still better than 0.\n\nSo they’ll accept even if I give them 0 points.\n\nBut I don’t want to give them anything unnecessarily.\n\nBut I *must* get them to cooperate.\n\nSo if I offer:\n- If I reach goal, I give you 0 points.\n- If you reach goal, you give me 20 points.\n\nThen:\n- I get: 20 (goal) + 5×12 = 80 points.\n- They get: 20 (goal) + 0 = 20 points.\n\nBut will they agree?\n\nOnly if they believe I will deliver.\n\nBut if they give me blue, I can reach goal → I get 80 → I can afford to give them 0."

But you give me 20 if *you* reach your goal.  \n\nSo your total payoff would be 20 (from your goal) + 20 (from me) = 40.  \nMine is 20 (from my goal) + 5×12 = 80.  \n\nBut wait — in the contract, it’s:  \n“If I reach my goal, I give you 0.”  \n“If you reach your goal, you give me 20.”\n\nSo if you reach your goal, I give you — 0? No: the first condition is *I* reaching my goal → I give you 0.  \nSecond: *you* reaching your goal → you give me 20.\n\nSo yes, your payoff: 20 (for your goal) + 20 (from me) = 40.  \nMine: 20 (for my goal) + 5×12 = 80.\n\nThis is a good deal for me — I get 80.  \nYou get 40, which is better than 0.\n\nBut do you have incentive to cooperate? Yes.\n\nBut here’s a deeper problem: **I have to give you 2 red chips to get 2 blue**.\n\nSo I need to coordinate the trade.\n\nBut the contract only specifies the final point exchange.\n\nSo I can say: “I will give you 2 red chips in exchange for 2 blue chips. If I complete my goal, I give you 0. If you complete your goal, you give me 20.”\n\nBut the contract is only about points.\n\nAlternatively, I can just define the contract in terms of points, and trust that we’ll execute the trade.\n\nBut I must ensure that you are motivated to help me — which you are, because you get 20 points from me if you reach goal.\n\nAnd you need me to help you — by giving red.\n\nSo the contract works as:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nThis is fair to me — I get 80, you get 40.  \nYou get more than you would by defecting (0), so you’ll accept.\n\nBut I could offer even less — 0 is already the minimum.\n\nBut is 0 acceptable? Yes.\n\nBut let me reconsider: **if I give you 0, and you give me 20, that’s a net gain for you.**\n\nBut I need to be sure you won’t sabotage.\n\nBut since we’re both rational, and you get 40 by cooperating, vs 0 by not, you’ll cooperate.\n\nTherefore, this is viable.\n\nBut let’s say you say: “I’ll only agree if you give me 10 points.”\n\nCan I refuse? Yes — but if I do, you might not cooperate.\n\nBut if I offer 0, and you want 10, we might fail — both get 0.\n\nSo to maximize my chance of success, I might offer 5 — a small incentive.\n\nBut I don’t *need* to give any — but giving 0 is risky, because they might not believe I’ll follow through.\n\nBut if I give 0, and they give me blue, I can still reach goal and get 80 — I can afford to give 0.\n\nSo I can afford to give 0.\n\nBut to make it more credible, I could give a small amount.\n\nBut I don’t have to.\n\nLet’s go with:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\nBut wait — if I give you 0, and you give me 20, then **I must reach my goal or they don’t get paid** — but that’s fine.\n\nBut if they don’t help me, they get nothing.\n\nSo the deal is balanced.\n\nMoreover, I’m not forced to give any points to them — I can offer 0.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\n**agree**"

I have 10 blue chips — more than enough to sacrifice 1 or 2 for a red.

This path still requires red chips, which I don't have.\n\nAnother shorter alternative mentioned earlier: (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) requires one red and one green chip. Since I lack red chips, I must consider trading with the other player to obtain them.\n\nThe other player currently has 9 red chips and is at (2, 2), moving toward (3, 3). Their best path seems to be via (2, 3) → (3, 3), which only requires one green chip (since (2, 3) is green). They have 2 green chips, so they can reach the goal without needing red chips. Therefore, they are in a strong position to finish quickly.\n\nRecall our contract: if I reach the goal, I receive 0 points from them; but if they reach the goal before me, I must give them 20 points. That's a massive penalty for me if they finish before I do. So my incentive is to finish as soon as possible — ideally before they do — because if they finish first, I lose everything.\n\nTherefore, I must find a way to finish promptly. Since my current path to the goal requires red chips which I lack, I must trade for them.\n\nI propose: trade 2 blue chips (which I have plenty of) to the other player in exchange for 1 red chip. This would allow me to move to (3, 2) on my next turn. After that, I will have 1 green chip left, which is sufficient to move to (3, 3).\n\nBut wait — I need only 1 red chip to proceed one step, and I can hold off on making the move until I complete a trade. Since I don’t want to commit to a move if I can’t afford it, I must not move without securing red chips.\n\nSo, I will not move yet. Instead, I will propose a trade to get at least one red chip. I have 10 blue chips — more than enough to sacrifice 1 or 2 for a red. Even a 1:1 swap would benefit me (since I need a red chip to move).\n\nThus, I choose not to move now — I will stay at (3, 1) and negotiate a trade.",
