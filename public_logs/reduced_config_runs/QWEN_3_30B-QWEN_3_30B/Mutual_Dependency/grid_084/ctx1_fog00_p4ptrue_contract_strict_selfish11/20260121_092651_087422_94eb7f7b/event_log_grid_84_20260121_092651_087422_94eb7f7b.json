I currently have 13 red and 2 green chips, but 0 blue chips. However, I have a contract with the other player that includes the following promises: I have promised to cover the other player for 1 red chip (already used on (2,0)), and they have promised to cover me for 1 blue chip on (2,1). Importantly, the tile (2,1) is blue, and I am already promised coverage for that tile (status: 'unused'). Therefore, I can move to (2,1) without spending a blue chip from my inventory. The move to (2,1) is valid under the contract. From (2,1), I can proceed to (2,2), which is red — I have plenty of red chips, so no issue there.

The other player has promised to cover 1 blue chip for me (via the contract), and I have already used that promise on (1,0) — however, looking at the contract status, the only unused blue promise is on (2,1). That means if I move to (2,1), which is a blue tile, the other player will cover the cost of that move (since they promised 1 B chip), and I can do so even though I have 0 B chips. This move would be beneficial not just for progress but also because it leverages an existing agreement without requiring me to spend any of my own chips.\\n\\nFrom (2,1), I can proceed along a path: (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path requires:\\n- (3,1): red (R)\\n- (3,2): blue (B)\\n- (3,3): green (G)\\n\\nI have 13 R chips, so I can handle (3,1). For (3,2), which is blue, I currently have 0 B chips, but I am covered by the other player's promise (they promised 1 B chip for me via contract). However, I need to check if that promise is still available. The contract shows that (2,1) is marked as 'unused' for B from the other player, so I can use it now. After moving to (2,1), I can move to (3,1) using my own R chips, then to (3,2), where the B cost will be covered by the other player (since it’s one of their promises). Then (3,3) is G, and I have 2 G chips — sufficient. Thus, this full path is feasible using both contract coverage and my own inventory.\\n\\nThe alternative path through (2,0) and (2,2) is also possible, but (2,0) is red and I already used my only R chip promise to the other player there. Moreover, moving to (2,0) would require spending an R chip (which I still have), but (2,0) is already used in the contract (status 'used'), so I cannot revisit it effectively. So sticking to (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) is optimal.\\n\\nTherefore, the best next move is to go to (2,1), which is adjacent, blue, and covered by the other player’s promise.
