This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

If you don’t help me, I die and get 0.**\n\nBut in this deal, even if I succeed, you only give me 5 — which is worse than nothing, but actually better than nothing, but I could do better.\n\nWait — no: if I don’t cooperate, I get 0.\n\nIf I cooperate and succeed, I get 75 - 5 = 70.\n\nIf I don’t cooperate, I get 0.\n\nSo 70 > 0 — so I *can* benefit.\n\nBut the problem is: you are asking for 5 points from me if I succeed, and you give me 20 if you succeed.\n\nBut since you are offering a contract, and I must benefit *strictly*, and I can reach 70, which is better than 0, then I *do* benefit.\n\nBut I can do better if I ask for a higher reward.\n\nBut I can’t take more than 20.\n\nSo suppose I counter with:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThat way, I get 20 if you succeed, and I give nothing — but only if I succeed.\n\nBut I only succeed if you help me.\n\nBut if I do succeed, and you give me 20, and I give you 0, then my net is 75 + 20 = 95.\n\nBut you get: if you succeed, 80, and you give me 20 — so you get 80 − 20 = 60.\n\nBut you can do better if you get more.\n\nBut in that deal, I am not asking you to pay for my success — I'm asking you to pay me for *yours*.\n\nBut you need me to give you R chips to reach goal.\n\nSo you must succeed only if I help.\n\nBut in this deal: if I help you, and you succeed, I get 20.\n\nIf I don’t help, I get 0.\n\nSo I benefit from helping.\n\nBut you need to pay me 20 only if you reach goal.\n\nThat's acceptable.\n\nBut I can do slightly better.\n\nLet’s try:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is better for me than your original offer (where I only get 5 if I succeed).\n\nSo I propose this.\n\nBut is it fair? Well, I don’t care about fairness. Only my score.\n\nIn this deal, I get 75 (from my path) + 20 (from your agreement) = 95, if we both succeed.\n\nYou get 80 (from your path) - 20 (from the contract) = 60.\n\nBut you could have asked for more.\n\nBut you need me to help you.\n\nSo you might accept.\n\nBut I can offer a better deal.\n\nWhat if I say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nYes.\n\nBut let’s check: if I don’t reach goal, I get 0, and I don’t pay anything.\n\nIf I do, I get 75 + 20 = 95.\n\nYou get 80 − 20 = 60.\n\nYou could have asked for more, but not if you want me to help.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is my best offer.\n\n**agree**"

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
