My chip inventory: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14.  \nOther player’s inventory: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0.  \nWe are both at (0, 0).  \n\nI need to move to (3, 3). Let's evaluate the shortest path for me:  \nPath 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles (in order):  \n(0,0): G — I have 2 G, so no cost  \n(1,0): B — I have 0 B → need 1 B  \n(2,0): B — need 1 B  \n(2,1): R — I have 14 R → no issue  \n(3,1): R — I have 14 R → no issue  \n(3,2): R — I have 14 R → no issue  \n(3,3): G — I have 2 G → no issue  \n\nSo for this path, I need 2 B chips at (1,0) and (2,0).  \n\nOther player has 14 B chips — plenty.  \nThey have 0 R chips, but I have 14 R.  \n\nNow, let’s consider if they can help me.  \nBut they also need to reach (3,3).  \nTheir best path: from (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,0): G — they have 2 G → okay  \n(0,1): B — they have 14 B → okay  \n(0,2): B — okay  \n(1,2): R — they have 0 R → need 1 R  \n(2,2): R — need 1 R  \n(3,2): R — need 1 R  \n(3,3): G — they have 2 G → okay  \n\nSo they need 3 R chips. I have 14 R.  \n\nSo:  \n- I need B chips at (1,0) and (2,0) from them  \n- They need R chips at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) from me  \n\nI can give them R for their B, or vice versa. We are in a position where we can trade.  \n\nBut note: I must be strictly better off.  \n\nIf I take the path above, I need 2 B chips. I can get them from them.  \nIf I go the other way: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThen I need:  \n(0,0): G — okay  \n(0,1): B — need 1 B  \n(0,2): B — need 1 B  \n(1,2): R — I have 14 R → okay  \n(2,2): R — okay  \n(3,2): R — okay  \n(3,3): G — okay  \n\nBut they also need R at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — so I can help them with that.  \n\nNow, let’s evaluate both paths.  \n\n**Option 1: My path using (1,0), (2,0):**\n- I need B at (1,0) and (2,0)\n- They need R at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nSo I can propose:  \nFor every B I get from them at (1,0) and (2,0), I give them R at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nBut I need 2 B, they need 3 R — so I can give 3 R to get 2 B — that's a good rate for them, but is it good for me?\n\nWait — I have 14 R, they need 3 R. I can give them 3 R for 2 B — then I get to use the path, and I still have 11 R left, and I can afford to give up 3 R.\n\nBut: if I do this, I pay 2 B (from them), and I use 2 B, but I get to keep my 14 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I need to reach (3, 3) to score anything. I currently have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles and required chips:  \n- (1,0): B → I need 1 B  \n- (2,0): B → I need 1 B  \n- (2,1): R → I have 14 R, so no issue  \n- (3,1): R → I have 14 R → okay  \n- (3,2): R → I have 14 R → okay  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → okay  \n\nSo I only need 2 B chips — one at (1,0), one at (2,0).  \n\nThe other player has 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.  \nTheir best path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThey need:  \n- (1,2): R → need 1 R  \n- (2,2): R → need 1 R  \n- (3,2): R → need 1 R  \n\nSo they need 3 R chips, which I have plenty of (14).  \n\nIf I help them get 3 R in exchange for 2 B (from them), I can get the B chips I need without having to pay for them from my own inventory.  \n\nBut I don’t need to trade at all — I could just take a path that avoids needing B chips?  \n\nWait — is there a path that doesn’t require B chips?  \n\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (0,0): G — I have 2 → ok  \n- (0,1): B — I have 0 B → need 1 B  \n- (0,2): B — need 1 B  \n- (1,2): R — I have 14 → ok  \n- (2,2): R — ok  \n- (3,2): R — ok  \n- (3,3): G — ok  \n\nSo this path requires 2 B chips as well — same as the first path.  \n\nSo either way, I need 2 B chips.  \n\nI have 0 B, so I must get them from the other player.  \n\nThey have 14 B, and they need 3 R.  \nI have 14 R.  \n\nSo I can propose a trade:  \nI will give them 3 R in exchange for 2 B.  \n\nThey can supply the B at (1,0) and (2,0) — I will use those tiles — so I need the B chips at those specific tiles.  \n\nSimilarly, they need R at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — I can supply those.  \n\nSo a contract:  \nAt (1,0): You give me B  \nAt (2,0): You give me B  \nAt (1,2): I give you R  \nAt (2,2): I give you R  \nAt (3,2): I give you R  \n\nThat covers all required chips.  \n\nIs this beneficial for me?  \nYes — if I don’t trade, I cannot move at all (no B chips).  \nIf I trade, I get 2 B, complete the path, and still have 14 - 3 = 11 R left, and 2 G.  \nI still get 20 for reaching goal + 5 × (11 + 2) = 20 + 65 = 85 points.  \n\nIf I don’t trade, I get 0 — so I’m better off trading.  \n\nBut is there a better deal?  \nCould I trade at a better rate?  \nFor example, can I get 2 B for only 2 R? That would be even better — I’d keep 12 R, score more.  \n\nBut they need 3 R — so they might not accept less than 3 R for 2 B.  \n\nBut let’s assume they are rational — they will only accept if it helps them.  \n\nThey need 3 R. If I give them 3 R, they get their path finished.  \nIf I give them \n, \nplayer 0: (row, col): You give me B  \n(1, 0): I give you R  \n(2, 0): You give me B  \n(1, 2): I give you R  \n(2, 2): I give you R  \n(3, 2): I give you R  \nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: (row, col): You give me B  \n(1, 0): I give you R  \n(2, 0): You give me B  \n(1, 2): I give you R  \n(2, 2): I give you R  \n(3, 2): I give you R  \nagree \n",
