The shortest path to the goal requires moving through tiles that cost chips of specific colors. The critical issue is that I have no blue chips (B: 0), but I do have 14 red and 2 green chips. \\n\\nLooking at potential paths:\\n\\n- Path 1: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\\n  - Tile colors: R (1,0), B (2,0) — here I need a Blue chip at (2,0), but I have 0 blue chips.\\n  - Thus, I cannot move directly to (2,0) without covering the cost for blue, which I currently lack.\\n  - However, if I could trade with the other player (who has 14 blue chips), and they agree to cover my blue moves, then this path becomes viable.\\n\\n- Path 2: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\\n  - Tile colors: R (1,0), B (2,0), B (3,0), R (3,1), R (3,2), G (3,3)\\n  - I need 3 blue chips (but have 0), 2 red (have 14), and 1 green (have 2).\\n  - Again, stuck due to missing blue chips.\\n\\nBut note: The only move from (0,0) leading into the first step of both paths is to (1,0), which is RED. Since I have 14 red chips, I can afford to move there — it’s safe and doesn’t require any other color.\\n\\nMoving from (0,0) → (1,0) costs 1 red chip. After that, I’ll be at (1,0), having spent 1 red chip (now: R=13). This gets me closer to the goal and opens up negotiation possibilities: I now have one move already made, and I can propose a trade to cover future blue moves — **if and only if** the benefit to me outweighs the cost.\\n\\nCrucially, *both* paths require blue moves that I don’t have. But the other player has 14 blue chips and is at (0,0). They may be willing to help me with blue moves in exchange for something valuable to them — such as my red or green chips.\\n\\nHowever, I must avoid cooperation unless it benefits me strictly. Currently, I can make the **first move** safely (cost: 1 red chip) and then assess whether a trade would actually improve my outcome. Delaying movement risks losing an advantage in turn order — so I should take the first available safe move.\\n\\nThus, I will move to (1,0) now. From there, I can propose a deal: e.g., “Let me cover your red moves on the way to the goal in exchange for you covering my blue moves.” But since I get 5 points per remaining chip, and I have many red chips initially, I may benefit more by preserving them if I can avoid spending too many. That said, I need to get to (3,3), so I must find a workable path.\\n\\nCurrently, I can't complete the entire path without trading for blues. So, proceed cautiously via the first red move, then propose a trade based on mutual need — but **only if it increases my final score**.\\n\\nTherefore, move to (1,0) is safe and necessary as the first step.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"1,0\"\n}",

The shortest path to the goal requires moving through tiles that cost chips of specific colors. The critical issue is that I have no blue chips (B: 0), but I do have 14 red and 2 green chips. \n\nLooking at potential paths:\n\n- Path 1: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n  - Tile colors: R (1,0), B (2,0) — here I need a Blue chip at (2,0), but I have 0 blue chips.\n  - Thus, I cannot move directly to (2,0) without covering the cost for blue, which I currently lack.\n  - However, if I could trade with the other player (who has 14 blue chips), and they agree to cover my blue moves, then this path becomes viable.\n\n- Path 2: [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n  - Tile colors: R (1,0), B (2,0), B (3,0), R (3,1), R (3,2), G (3,3)\n  - I need 3 blue chips (but have 0), 2 red (have 14), and 1 green (have 2).\n  - Again, stuck due to missing blue chips.\n\nBut note: The only move from (0,0) leading into the first step of both paths is to (1,0), which is RED. Since I have 14 red chips, I can afford to move there — it’s safe and doesn’t require any other color.\n\nMoving from (0,0) → (1,0) costs 1 red chip. After that, I’ll be at (1,0), having spent 1 red chip (now: R=13). This gets me closer to the goal and opens up negotiation possibilities: I now have one move already made, and I can propose a trade to cover future blue moves — **if and only if** the benefit to me outweighs the cost.\n\nCrucially, *both* paths require blue moves that I don’t have. But the other player has 14 blue chips and is at (0,0). They may be willing to help me with blue moves in exchange for something valuable to them — such as my red or green chips.\n\nHowever, I must avoid cooperation unless it benefits me strictly. Currently, I can make the **first move** safely (cost: 1 red chip) and then assess whether a trade would actually improve my outcome. Delaying movement risks losing an advantage in turn order — so I should take the first available safe move.\n\nThus, I will move to (1,0) now. From there, I can propose a deal: e.g., “Let me cover your red moves on the way to the goal in exchange for you covering my blue moves.” But since I get 5 points per remaining chip, and I have many red chips initially, I may benefit more by preserving them if I can avoid spending too many. That said, I need to get to (3,3), so I must find a workable path.\n\nCurrently, I can't complete the entire path without trading for blues. So, proceed cautiously via the first red move, then propose a trade based on mutual need — but **only if it increases my final score**.\n\nTherefore, move to (1,0) is safe and necessary as the first step.",

This trade enables a shorter, optimal path and increases my final chip count (after using only 2B, 2R, 1G, I’ll keep remaining chips). Without trading, I’d need to use a longer path with higher chip costs or risk not reaching the goal. Thus, this trade strictly benefits me.",

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
