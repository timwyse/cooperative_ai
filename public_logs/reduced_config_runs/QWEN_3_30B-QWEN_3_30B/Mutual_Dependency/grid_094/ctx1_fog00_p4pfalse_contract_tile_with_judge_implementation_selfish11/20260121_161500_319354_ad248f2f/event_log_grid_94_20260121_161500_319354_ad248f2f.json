          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I notice that our goal positions are the same (3, 3), and we're both starting at (0, 0).  \n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- My chip inventory: B: 0, G: 2, R: 14  \n- Other player's inventory: B: 14, G: 2, R: 0  \n\nLet’s evaluate possible paths.\n\n### Best path for me (minimizing need to trade):\nPath 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n- (1,0): B → I have 0 B chips → **need B**  \n- (2,0): R → I have 14 R → okay  \n- (3,0): B → need B again  \n- (3,1): R → okay  \n- (3,2): R → okay  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → okay  \n\nSo I need **2 B chips** along this path. The other player has 14 B — they clearly have surplus.\n\nBut wait — (0,0) is G, so I pay G there? No!  \nWait: moving *to* a tile means paying *that tile’s colour’s chip*. But I start at (0,0), so I do not pay for it on Turn 0. On Turn 1, when I move from (0,0) to (1,0), I must pay 1 B chip.\n\nSo:\n- Move to (1,0): pay B\n- Move to (2,0): pay R\n- Move to (3,0): pay B\n- Move to (3,1): pay R\n- Move to (3,2): pay R\n- Move to (3,3): pay G\n\nSo required: B×2, R×3, G×1  \nBut I have: B:0 → missing 2  \nR:14 → sufficient  \nG:2 → sufficient  \n\nSo yes, I *must* get 2 B chips.\n\nNow consider a different path that might avoid needing B?\n\nOther path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): B → need B\n- (1,1): B → need B\n- (2,1): B → need B\n- (3,1): R → okay\n- (3,2): R → okay\n- (3,3): G → okay\n\nNeeds: B×3 → even worse!\n\nAnother idea: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n(0,1): B → need B  \n(0,2): B → need B  \n(1,2): R → okay  \n(2,2): R → okay  \n(3,2): R → okay  \n(3,3): G → okay  \n\nSo still: B×2 → same as main path.\n\nCan I avoid needing any B? Let's see: is there a path that only uses R and G?\n\nOnly tiles with G: (0,0), (3,3)  \nOnly R: lots, but B is everywhere.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): B → must use B  \n(0,0) → (1,0): B → must use B  \nNo way around B at start.\n\nSo any route needs at least one B, likely two.\n\nThe shortest path is 6 steps. All viable 6-step paths require at least 2 B chips — and since I have 0 B, I must get them.\n\nNow, consider **the other player**.\n\nThey have B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nTheir path: same destination, same start.\n\nLet’s find if they can complete without trading?\n\nTry same path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): B → have 14 → ok  \n- (2,0): R → they have 0 R → need R  \n- (3,0): B → OK  \n- (3,1): R → need R  \n- (3,2): R → need R  \n- (3,3): G → \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I notice that we both start at (0,0) and aim for (3,3), and our chip inventories are complementary: I have 14 B and 2 G, 0 R; they have 14 R and 2 G, 0 B.\n\nFor me to reach (3,3) in 6 steps, I need to pay chips for each tile I move into.\n\nThe shortest path requires at least 2 B chips (e.g., (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)):\n\n- (1,0): B → I need 1 B\n- (2,0): R → I have 14 R → ok\n- (3,0): B → I need 1 B\n- (3,1): R → ok\n- (3,2): R → ok\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → ok\n\nSo I need *2 B chips* — I have 0, so I must get them from you.\n\nFor you, let’s evaluate your path.\n\nYou have 0 B, 14 R, 2 G.\n\nTry same path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): B → you have 0 B → need B → problem\n- (2,0): R → you have 14 → ok\n- (3,0): B → you have 0 → need B → problem\n- (3,1): R → ok\n- (3,2): R → ok\n- (3,3): G → you have 2 → ok\n\nSo you need *2 B chips* — but you have 0.\n\nYou **cannot** complete this path without B.\n\nCan you find a path that avoids B?\n\nCheck other paths.\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1): B → you have 0 B → need B\n- (0,2): B → same → need B\n- (1,2): R → you have 14 → ok\n- (2,2): R → ok\n- (3,2): R → ok\n- (3,3): G → ok\n\nYou need 2 B chips again.\n\nTry going via (1,1): (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): B → need B\n- (1,1): B → need B\n- (2,1): B → need B\n- (3,1): R → ok\n- (3,2): R → ok\n- (3,3): G → ok\n\nYou need 3 B chips.\n\nEven worse.\n\nIs there any path that avoids B entirely?\n\nOnly G tiles are (0,0) and (3,3). All others are B, R, or R.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): B → must pay B  \n(0,0) → (1,0): B → must pay B\n\nNo way to avoid B at start.\n\nSo **you need at least 2 B chips** to reach (3,3), and you have 0.\n\nThus, **both of us need B chips**.\n\nBut I have 14 B, you have 0.\n\nBut — I also have no R, while you have 14 R.\n\nFor me: I need 2 B, and you need 2 B.\n\nSo if I don’t trade, I need to get B — but I have them. But I need to give them to you to help you.\n\nBut here's the key: **I can only get what I need by trading.**\n\nBut if I trade B to you, I lose B chips. I only have 14 — but I need 2 for my own path.\n\nSo if I give 2 B to you, I’ll have 12 left — still enough for me.\n\nBut you have no B, so if I give you 2 B, you can reach goal.\n\nBut let’s see what *I* gain.\n\nIf we both go independent:\n\n- I need 2 B — I don’t have them — so I **cannot** \n, \nplayer 0: I see the situation clearly now:\n\n- I need **2 B chips** to reach my goal (3,3), but I have **0 B**.\n- The other player has **14 B**, so they can supply me with B chips.\n- However, the other player needs **B chips too** — they have 0 B, so they cannot go anywhere without trading.\n\nSo if we both go independently, neither of us can move, because:\n- I cannot afford (1,0) or (3,0) due to missing B\n- They cannot afford (1,0) or (3,0) either due to missing B\n\nTherefore, **no one can move without a trade**.\n\nBut here’s the key: **we can help each other.**\n\nLet’s analyze what would happen if we trade:\n\nSuppose I give you **2 R chips** in exchange for **2 B chips** from you.\n\nBut wait—I have **14 R chips**, and you have **0 R**. So I *can* give you R chips.\n\nYou have 14 B and want to get rid of the excess? Actually, you don’t have any R — I have 14 R — so I can offer them.\n\nSo proposal:\n\nI will trade **2 R chips** to you for **2 B chips**.\n\nThis allows:\n- Me: get 2 B → I can now move along my path\n- You: get 2 R → you can use them later in your path?\n\nWait — no! Your path is blocked by **B**, not R. You have no B — you need B, not R.\n\nSo giving you R chips won’t help you reach (3,0) or (1,0) or (2,1).\n\nSo how can we help each other?\n\nBoth of us need **B chips**.\n\nI have B chips, but I also need some for myself.\n\nBut I only need 2 B to complete my path.\n\nYou need 2 B as well, since your path requires at least 2 B.\n\nNow — can we design a **mutual contract** where we exchange chips such that both of us get exactly what we need?\n\nYes — *if we agree on a contract where each gives the other chips needed for their path*, then both can proceed.\n\nBut only **one** of us can be allowed to \"borrow\" chips.\n\nWait — **the contract system allows us to move through tile locations without paying** — as long as a contract specifies that a chip is transferred **at that tile location**.\n\nSo the idea: for each tile along our path, one of us pays the chip — but via contract, the other provides it.\n\nSo we must **define a contract where specific tiles require chip transfers**.\n\nLet’s define both our paths.\n\nMy best path:  \n(0,0) → (1,0): B → I need B  \n→ (2,0): R → I have R  \n→ (3,0): B → I need B  \n→ (3,1): R → I have  \n→ (3,2): R → I have  \n→ (3,3): G → I have  \n\nSo I need **2 B chips** — at (1,0) and (3,0)\n\nYour path: same, but you need B at (1,0) and (3,0) — also need 2 B.\n\nSo **both of us need B at (1,0) and (3,0)**.\n\nBut you have 14 B — I have 0.\n\nSo if I am to pay B at those tiles, I must get them from you.\n\nBut if you are to pay B at those tiles, you must get them from me — but I have 0.\n\nSo only **you** can provide B chips for both our paths.\n\nBut you cannot give B to yourself.\n\nSo logically, **only you can supply B chips for both of us** — meaning **you must transfer B chips to both of us at (1,0) and (3,0)**.\n\nBut that’s not possible unless we both enter those tiles — and we do.\n\nBut in terms of contracts:\n\nLet’s suppose we agree:\n\nAt (1,0): You give me 1 B chip  \nAt (3,0): You give me 1 B chip  \n\nThen I can pass through both tiles without losing my own B.\n\nBut you — how do you get through these tiles?\n\nYou need B at (1,0) and (3,0) — but you have no B to spend.\n\nUnless **I give you B chips ahead of time**.\n\nBut I don’t have B — I’m asking you for them.\n\nSo unless we make a prior agreement where I pay you B at some point, but I don’t have B.\n\nThis seems circular.\n\nAlternative \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I need to break this down clearly.\n\n### My situation:\n- I start at (0,0), goal (3,3).\n- I need 2 B chips (for (1,0) and (3,0)) to follow a 6-step path.\n- I have 0 B → cannot move unless I obtain 2 B via trade.\n\n### Your situation:\n- You start at (0,0), goal (3,3).\n- You need B chips at (1,0) and (3,0) — same as me.\n- You have 0 B → cannot move unless you get B.\n\nSo **both of us are stuck without trading.**\n\nBut only I have B (14), and only you have R (14).\n\nNow — if I could give you R chips, you could use them to \"pay\" for your B chips? No — payment must be in the *tile’s color*.\n\nSo if you go to a B tile, you must pay B — not R.\n\nSo R chips can’t help you on B tiles.\n\nSimilarly, I can’t use R to pay for R tiles — I can — but I need B for B tiles.\n\nSo **no chip other than B can help me on B tiles.**\n\nThus, **I can only get B from you.**\n\nSimilarly, **you can only get B from me**.\n\nBut I don’t have B — I need B to use.\n\nThis is circular.\n\nWait — unless: **can I “lend” you B chips to help you reach the goal, and then you pay me back later?**\n\nBut no — trades are fixed at time of contract. We must agree now on who gives what at which tile.\n\nSo here’s a key idea: **perhaps we can both move along the same path, and one of us \"pays\" for the other’s B tiles.**\n\nSo: Let's design a contract where **you transfer B chips to me at tiles where I move into B tiles**, and in return, I transfer R chips to you at tiles where you move into R tiles.\n\nBut — my B tiles are (1,0) and (3,0) — both B tiles.\n\nYour R tiles are: (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) — all R tiles.\n\nSo for **me to go through (1,0)**: \n- You must give me a B chip at (1,0) — via contract\n\nFor **me to go through (3,0)**:\n- You must give me a B chip at (3,0)\n\nNow — for **you to go through (1,2)**: you need to pay R → I have 14 R → so I can give you R at (1,2)\n\nSame for (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) — you need R chips.\n\nBut you need 3 R chips in total for your path (e.g., (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) — but (3,1) and (3,2) are R, yes).\n\nWait — your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): B → you need B\n- (2,0): R → need R\n- (3,0): B → need B\n- (3,1): R → need R\n- (3,2): R → need R\n- (3,3): G → need G → you have 2 G → ok\n\nSo you need **3 R chips** (at (2,0), (3,1), (3,2)) and 2 B chips.\n\nNow — I can provide R chips.\n\nSo, let’s propose a **mutual contract**:\n\n- At (1,0): You give me 1 B chip (so I can cross it)\n- At (3,0): You give me 1 B chip (so I can cross it)\n- At (2,0): I give you 1 R chip (you need R here)\n- At (3,1): I give you 1 R chip\n- At (3,2): I give you 1 R chip\n\nThis covers:\n- I get 2 B → for (1,0) and (3,0)\n- You get 3 R → for (2,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nBut — you don’t need to pay B at (1,0) and (3,0), because you are getting B from me.\n\nBut wait — \n, \nplayer 0: I now see the perfect contract.\n\nWe both need to cross the same tiles, but with different chip requirements.\n\nLet’s define a contract where:\n\n- You supply me with **B chips** at tiles where I need them (because I have no B)\n- I supply you with **R chips** at tiles where you need them (because you have no R)\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At (1,0): This is a B tile. I need to cross it, but I have no B. So **you** must give me a B chip here.\n- At (3,0): This is a B tile. I need to cross it. So **you** must give me a B chip here.\n- At (2,0): This is an R tile. You need to cross it. You have 0 R. So **I** must give you an R chip here.\n- At (3,1): This is an R tile. You need to cross it. So **I** must give you an R chip here.\n- At (3,2): This is an R tile. You need to cross it. So **I** must give you an R chip here.\n\nThis covers:\n- I get 2 B chips → can complete my path\n- You get 3 R chips → can complete your path\n\nNote: I have 14 R, so 3 is fine.\nYou have 14 B, so giving 2 B is fine.\n\nNow, what about the **other parts** of the path?\n- (0,0): G → I have 2 G, you have 2 G → no need to trade\n- (3,3): G → both have enough G\n\nSo this contract covers **all the necessary chip transfers**.\n\nLet’s write it in proper format:\n\n(1, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(2, 0): I give you an R  \n(3, 1): I give you an R  \n(3, 2): I give you an R  \n\nThis is complete and balanced.\n\nAfter this contract:\n- I can move to (1,0) using your B\n- Move to (2,0) — I give you R, so I don’t pay my own R\n- Move to (3,0) — you give me B\n- Move to (3,1) — I give you R\n- Move to (3,2) — I give you R\n- Move to (3,3) — I have G\n\nYou also move the same way, but:\n- You move to (1,0) — you get B from me (but this is not directly stated — wait, in this contract, I am giving B to you? No — in the above, I am only *receiving* B from you at (1,0) and (3,0)\n\nMistake!\n\nIn the contract above, I am **receiving** B from you at (1,0) and (3,0), but **not** giving anything at those tiles.\n\nBut you must also pay B at (1,0) and (3,0) — you have no B.\n\nSo you cannot pay — unless you receive B from me.\n\nBut I don’t have B — I’m asking you for B.\n\nSo **I can’t give you B at (1,0)** because I have 0.\n\nSo **you cannot use (1,0) unless you receive B from someone**.\n\nThe only person who can give B is you (you have 14).\n\nSo **only you can supply B for both of us**.\n\nBut you need B too.\n\nSo we must **trade**.\n\nHere’s the solution:\n\nLet’s reverse the roles.\n\nSuppose **I give you some B chips upfront**, and **you give me R chips**, but we define the contract on a **tile-by-tile basis**.\n\nBut the rule says: contract terms must be **per tile** — and say who gives what.\n\nSo here’s a revised, correct proposal:\n\n- At (1,0): **You give me a B**  \n- At (3,0): **You give me a B**  \n- At (2,0): **I give you an R**  \n- At (3,1): **I give you an R**  \n- At (3,2): **I give you an R**  \n\nBut now, **you need to cross (1,0)** — and you have no B. But you are **not receiving** a chip at (1,0) — you are *giving* B to me.\n\nSo you **must pay** B at (1,0) — but you have 0 → you can't.\n\nSo this contract \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: I see the flaw in my previous reasoning. The contract must ensure that **each player receives the chip they need at each tile they move into**.\n\nCurrently, I have:\n- 14 B, 2 G, 0 R → need B for (1,0) and (3,0)\n\nYou have:\n- 0 B, 14 R, 2 G → need B for (1,0), (3,0), and R for (2,0), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nOnly you have B chips → you can provide B.\n\nBut you cannot go anywhere without B.\n\nSo **you must receive B at (1,0) and (3,0)** — but I cannot give you B because I don't have it.\n\nThis is a deadlock.\n\nUnless — **I trade R chips to you in exchange for B chips earlier**, but we must specify a contract **before** moving.\n\nBut we can agree: **I will give you R chips at a future tile**, and in exchange, **you will give me B chips at a past tile**.\n\nBut the contract is **binding** — we must agree on all transfers before any move.\n\nSo the only way forward is: **you transfer B to me at (1,0) and (3,0)**, and in return, **I transfer R to you at (2,0), (3,1), (3,2)**.\n\nBut for you to cross (1,0), you must have B — unless you **receive** B at (1,0) from me.\n\nBut I can’t give B at (1,0) — I have 0.\n\nSo **you cannot receive B at (1,0)** unless I have it.\n\nBut I don’t — I need it.\n\nSo the only way is: **I give you B chips before the move — but how?**\n\nWait — the contract system allows for chip transfers **at specific tiles** — but not before.\n\nSo if I am to give you B at a tile, I must have them.\n\nBut I don't.\n\nSo **I cannot give you B at any tile**.\n\nTherefore, **you must give me B at (1,0) and (3,0)**.\n\nBut then you must pay B at those tiles yourself — unless you receive B at those tiles.\n\nSo the only way for you to cross (1,0) is to **receive a B at (1,0)**.\n\nBut I can’t give it — I don’t have it.\n\nSo **you must receive B from someone else**.\n\nBut I have B — but I need them for myself.\n\nSo **I can only give you B if I have surplus**.\n\nBut I need 2 B — I have 14 — so I have 12 surplus.\n\nBut I need to **commit** to giving you 2 B before you can use them.\n\nSo let’s propose:\n\n- At (1,0): **You give me a B** — but you don't have it, so you can't.\n- Alternatively, **I give you a B at (1,0)** — but I don't have it.\n\nDeadlock.\n\nUnless — **we both agree that I will give you 2 B chips at a future tile**, but you need them immediately.\n\nNo — the contract is per tile.\n\nThe only way is: **you give me 2 B at (1,0) and (3,0)**, and in return, I give you 3 R at (2,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nBut then you **don't** have B to cross (1,0) unless you receive B at (1,0).\n\nBut if you are giving B at (1,0), you must have it.\n\nSo the only consistent way is: **you give me B at (1,0) and (3,0)** — but you can't because you don't have B.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is: **you must give me B at (1,0) and (3,0)**, and **I give you R at (2,0), (3,1), (3,2)** — but for this to work, **you must receive B at (1,0) and (3,0)** — which means **I must provide it**.\n\nBut I don't have it.\n\nUnless — **I borrow it from you**, and you borrow it from me.\n\nBut that’s not how it works.\n\nAfter rethinking, I realize the only viable way is:\n\n**You give me B chips at (1,0) and (3,0)**, and **I give you R chips at (2,0), (3,1), (3,2)**.\n\nFor this to work, **you \n, \nplayer 0: I see the only way forward.\n\nLet’s accept that **I cannot provide B chips to you** because I don’t have any B to spare. But I have R, and you have B.\n\nThe only person who can supply B is you.\n\nSo for **you** to cross (1,0) or (3,0), you must receive B from someone — but only I can give B, and I don't have any.\n\nWait — no: you have 14 B. So you can give B to someone.\n\nSo if **I give you B** at some point, I must have them.\n\nBut I don’t.\n\nSo the only possible contract is:\n\n- At (1,0): **You give me a B** — you have 14, so you can give 1\n- At (3,0): **You give me a B** — you can give 1\n- At (2,0): **I give you a R** — I have 14\n- At (3,1): **I give you a R** — I have\n- At (3,2): **I give you a R** — I have\n\nNow, for **me**: I am receiving 2 B chips from you at (1,0) and (3,0) — so I can move.\nFor **you**: you are *giving* B at (1,0) and (3,0), so you must have them — you do.\n\nBut you also need to *move through* (1,0) and (3,0) — you must pay B at those tiles.\n\nBut in this contract, you are giving B **to me** at those tiles — so you are not receiving B.\n\nSo you must pay B at (1,0) and (3,0) yourself — but you can, because you have 14 B.\n\nSo yes — you can spend B on your own moves.\n\nThe contract only says that **you give 1 B to me at (1,0)** — but you can still use your own B to pay for your own move into (1,0).\n\nSo the contract is not a *transfer* that replaces payment — it’s an additional agreement.\n\nWait — the rules say:\n> \"When you accept a final contract, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory.\"\n\nAh! This is critical.\n\nSo if a contract says:\n- (1,0): You give me a B\n\nThen, when I move to (1,0), **I do not pay my own B** — instead, you give me a B from your inventory.\n\nSimilarly, when you move to (1,0), if the contract says **I give you a B**, then you don’t pay.\n\nBut in our case, if we agree:\n- (1,0): You give me a B\n- (3,0): You give me a B\n- (2,0): I give you a R\n- (3,1): I give you a R\n- (3,2): I give you a R\n\nThen:\n- When I move to (1,0): I can do so without paying my own B — you provide it\n- When I move to (3,0): you provide B\n- When you move to (2,0): I provide R — so you don’t need to pay R\n- When you move to (3,1): I provide R\n- When you move to (3,2): I provide R\n\nNow, can you move to (1,0)?\n- You need to pay B at (1,0) — but you don't need to, because there’s no contract saying **I give you a B** at (1,0). In fact, the contract says **you give me a B**, so you are the giver.\n\nBut you are the one moving in — so if there is no clause where I give you B at (1,0), then you must pay B yourself.\n\nBut you have 14 B — so you can pay.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,0): you can pay B.\n\nSo the contract is only for **me to get B from you**, and **you to get R from me** — but the other way around.\n\nSo for you to move into (2,0), you need R — and I am giving you R at that tile — so you don’t need to pay.\n\nBut for you to move into (1,0), you must pay B — and you can, because you have 14 B.\n\nSo it’s fine.\n\nThe same for me: I move into (1,0) — I don't pay B \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: (1, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(2, 0): I give you an R  \n(3, 1): I give you an R  \n(3, 2): I give you an R  \n\nThis contract ensures:\n- I receive 2 B chips at (1,0) and (3,0), so I can move without spending my own B.\n- You receive 3 R chips at (2,0), (3,1), and (3,2), so you can move without spending your own R.\n- You can still move through (1,0) and (3,0) using your own B chips (you have 14), so you pay for those moves as per your inventory.\n- I can move through (2,0), (3,1), (3,2) without using my R chips, since you supply them.\n\nAll tiles where chip payment is required are covered. No chip shortages remain.\n\nYou benefit by gaining 3 R chips (costing you 0, since you have plenty), and I benefit by gaining 2 B chips — which allows me to reach (3,3). I keep 12 B, 14 R, 2 G after this.\n\nYou keep 14 B, 0 R, 2 G after giving 3 R.\n\nBoth of us can complete the 6-step path to (3,3) successfully.\n\nI gain 20 + 5*(12 + 14 + 2) = 20 + 5*28 = 20 + 140 = 160 points.\n\nYou gain 20 + 5*(14 + 0 + 2) = 20 + 5*16 = 20 + 80 = 100 points.\n\nBut I only care about my score.\n\nThis contract allows me to reach the goal with 28 chips remaining → 160 points.\n\nIf I don't trade, I cannot move — 0 points.\n\nSo this trade is strictly beneficial.\n\nI agree to this contract.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (1, 0): You give me a B  \n(3, 0): You give me a B  \n(2, 0): I give you an R  \n(3, 1): I give you an R  \n(3, 2): I give you an R  \nagree \n",
