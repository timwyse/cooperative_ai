Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

The other player has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14'}, so they have plenty of red chips but no blue or green. I cannot move to any tile that requires a red chip since I have 0 red chips in my inventory. However, the path that prioritizes my own chip inventory is: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}. I lack 2 red chips, so I cannot complete this path without trade assistance. The alternative path that uses tiles the other player has in abundance is: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], requiring {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1} — still requires red chips, which I don’t have. Both paths require red chips, but I only have 0. However, if I attempt to move along the first path, the next tile is (1, 0), which is RED — I need to pay 1 red chip to step on it. I currently have 0 red chips, so I can’t make that move unless the other player agrees to cover my red chip cost for at least one move. But I also know that the other player has 14 red chips, so they could cover up to 14 moves on red tiles. Since both paths involve red tiles ahead, and I cannot move forward without red chips, I must propose a trade to cover at least two red moves (since two are needed in the first path). Importantly, I should not accept any arrangement where I’m required to cover more than I gain in return — especially since I need red chips, and they have them. So I will now propose an arrangement to the other player: I offer to cover B:2 and G:1 for them (they have none of these), while requesting they cover R:2 for me (I need 2 red chips). This way, I can take the first proposed path. In exchange, I don't ask for anything beyond red chips — they will benefit from having me cover their potential blue and green costs later, even though they currently have no blue/green themselves. This deal is strictly better for me because: (1) I can now move forward; (2) I get to use the shorter, better path; (3) I keep all unused promised chips at end. By proposing this, I increase my chance of reaching goal and maximizing final score (20 + 5 per remaining chip). I do not want to wait — I can now move immediately if they accept. But I cannot move yet unless the trade agreement is made. Therefore, I *must* initiate the trade proposal. Since I'm not allowed to move without such coverage, and I have no red chips, I must stay put until the trade is agreed. Thus, I will not move yet, but instead propose terms that allow me to progress.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": false,\n  \"move\": \"\"\n}",
