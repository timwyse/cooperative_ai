Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let’s look at the two main possible paths:\n\n**Path 1 (prioritizing my chips):**\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Tile colors: G (0,0), R (1,0), B (1,1), R (2,1), B (3,1), B (3,2), G (3,3)\n- Chips needed: R: 2, B: 3, G: 1 → But I have R:14, G:2, B:0 → So I need 3 B and 1 G → I’m missing 3 B chips and 1 G.\n\n**Path 2 (using more R and B where I have them):**\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Colors: G (0,0), R (1,0), B (2,0), B (3,0), B (3,1), B (3,2), G (3,3)\n- Chips needed: R:1, B:4, G:1 → I have R:14, G:2, B:0 → So need 4 B and 1 G → Still missing 4 B and 1 G.\n\nSo in both cases, I am missing blue chips — I have 0 blue, but the path needs 3–4 blue chips. The other player has 14 blue chips, 2 green, 0 red. So they can cover blue chips.\n\nNow consider their path:\nTheir goal is also (3,3). They start at (0,0) — same location.\n\nTheir red chips: 0 → they have no red. But red appears on multiple tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2). So if they take any path that goes through red tiles, they need red chips. But they have 0 red — so they **must** get red from me.\n\nSo here's the key:\n- I have red chips (14), they need red to move on red tiles.\n- They have blue chips (14), I need blue to move on blue tiles.\n\nSo we are **mutually dependent**.\n\nI can propose a deal:\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 20 points.\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 10 points.\n\nBut let's see what's fair.\n\nIf I help you get your goal:\n- I can allow you to move on blue tiles by covering your blue costs — but you don't need blue? Wait — no.\n\nLet’s reframe: we are in “pay for other” mode. I can promise to cover the cost of their moves on certain colors.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover your blue moves up to X times\", then if you move on blue tiles, I pay your chip cost.\n\nSimilarly, you can cover my red moves.\n\nI need blue, you need red.\n\nSo here’s the mutual benefit:\n- I have red, you have blue.\n- I can cover your red tile moves (but you only need red if you go on red tiles).\n- But you have no red chips — so you **must** move through red tiles only if I cover the cost.\n\nLet’s analyze your best path.\n\nYour chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\nYou need to get to (3,3). Your moves:\n- You can try path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nColors: G (0,0), R (0,1), R (0,2), R (0,3), B (1,3), B (2,3), G (3,3)\nChips needed: R:3, B:1, G:2 → but you have R:0 → so you need to spend 3 red chips.\n\nYou can only do this if I cover the red cost for those moves.\n\nSo if I agree to cover your red cost for 3 moves, you can go this path.\n\nIs that path"

I have 0 blue and 2 green — so I’m missing 3 blue chips.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue chips, 2 green, 0 red.

But since they start with 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red, and if they take a path like (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3), the cost is:\n- R:3 (on (0,1),(0,2),(0,3)), B:2 (on (1,3),(2,3)), G:2 (on (0,0) and (3,3)) — but wait, (0,0) is green — they pay for that? No, starting tile — only pay when you *move into* a tile.\n\nActually, moving from (0,0) to (0,1): pays for (0,1) which is red — so yes, need red.\n\nAfter that:\n- (0,1): R\n- (0,2): R\n- (0,3): R\n- (1,3): B\n- (2,3): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nSo total cost: R:3, B:2, G:1 (only for (3,3), since (0,0) was starting point — not paid).\n\nBut they have *no* red — so they must rely on me covering red costs for 3 moves.\n\nThey also have B:14, G:2 — so they *can* afford B and G — no issue.\n\nSo they only need me to cover 3 red moves.\n\nNow, my path: shortest is 6 steps — requires 3 blue, 1 green — I have 0 blue, 2 green.\n\nSo if I use my green chips (2), I can cover the two green tiles in my path (if any), but still need 3 blue.\n\nI could ask them to cover my blue moves — specifically for 3 moves on blue tiles.\n\nSo:\n\n- I offer: I’ll cover 3 red moves for you (i.e., I’ll pay for your 3 red tiles).\n- You cover 3 blue moves for me (I’ll pay for my 3 blue tiles).\n\nThat’s balanced: we each cover 3 moves of the color the other lacks.\n\nAnd we both get to complete the path.\n\nBut here's the key: **who gets more points?**\n\nScoring: 20 for reaching goal + 5 per chip remaining.\n\nI currently have 14R, 2G, 0B → if I don’t trade, I can’t even complete the path — I’d get 0.\n\nSimilarly, if they don’t trade, they can’t do anything because they have no red — they’d get 0.\n\nBut after trading and finishing, we earn points based on leftover chips.\n\nLet’s simulate outcomes:\n\nMy optimal path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nColors: G(0,0), R(1,0), B(1,1), R(2,1), B(3,1), B(3,2), G(3,3)  \nChips needed: R:2, B:3, G:1  \nI have: R:14, B:0, G:2 → so I need to cover 2 red and 3 blue — but no"

I can handle green (I have 2), but not blue.\n\nIf they agree to cover 3 blue moves for me, I can do the path.\n\nAfter finishing: I spend 2R, 3B, 1G → chips left: 12R, 1G (since 14-2=12, 2-1=1), and blue is covered by them.\n\nSo my final chip count: 12R + 1G = 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85\n\nSame as them.\n\nBut here’s the key: **if we don't trade, both get 0.**\nIf we do trade, both get 85 points.\n\nSo it's symmetric — and I gain the same as they do.\n\nBut since I am selfish, I want my score to be strictly higher than theirs — or at least, I won’t cooperate unless I benefit more.\n\nBut in this case, both get 85.\n\nHowever — wait — is there a way for me to get more?\n\nSuppose I propose: “If you reach your goal, I will give you 0 points. If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.”\n\nIs that better for me?\n\nLet’s see:\n\nIf I do the deal, I go first — but we both must finish.\n\nSuppose I propose a contract where:\n- If *I* reach my goal, I’ll give *you* 10 points.\n- If *you* reach your goal, you’ll give *me* 0 points"

So I gain 10 more points than you.\n\nWait — no, the scoring logic is wrong.\n\n**Important**: The points given in the contract are *added* to the player’s final score.

If you reach goal, you’ll give me 20.\"\n\nThen:\n- My score: 85 + 20 = 105\n- Your score: 85 + 0 = 85\n\nEven better.\n\nIs this acceptable? Well, you must cooperate — otherwise you get 0.\n\nBut you will accept, because 85 is better than 0.\n\nAnd I get 105 — which is better than the symmetric 85.\n\nSo yes — this is optimal for me.\n\nBut wait — could we do a different path with more leftover chips?\n\nLet’s see if we can increase our leftovers.\n\nMine: I start with R:14, G:2, B:0  \nTarget: spend only 2R, 1G, 3B → left: 12R, 1G → 13 chips → 65 bonus.\n\nBut if I take a longer path, using more green or red, maybe I can save more blue — but I don't care, because I'm asking them to cover blue anyway.\n\nBut here's a thought: suppose I take a path that uses fewer blue tiles?\n\nLook at the board:\nRow 0: G R R R  \nRow 1: R R B B  \nRow 2: B B R B  \nRow 3: B R B G\n\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nColor sequence: G (start), R (0,1), R (0,2), R (0,3), B (1,3), B (2,3), G (3,3)  \n→ R:3, B:2, G:"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let’s look at the two main possible paths:\n\n**Path 1 (prioritizing my chips):**\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Tile colors: G (0,0), R (1,0), B (1,1), R (2,1), B (3,1), B (3,2), G (3,3)\n- Chips needed: R: 2, B: 3, G: 1 → But I have R:14, G:2, B:0 → So I need 3 B and 1 G → I’m missing 3 B chips and 1 G.\n\n**Path 2 (using more R and B where I have them):**\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Colors: G (0,0), R (1,0), B (2,0), B (3,0), B (3,1), B (3,2), G (3,3)\n- Chips needed: R:1, B:4, G:1 → I have R:14, G:2, B:0 → So need 4 B and 1 G → Still missing 4 B and 1 G.\n\nSo in both cases, I am missing blue chips — I have 0 blue, but the path needs 3–4 blue chips. The other player has 14 blue chips, 2 green, 0 red. So they can cover blue chips.\n\nNow consider their path:\nTheir goal is also (3,3). They start at (0,0) — same location.\n\nTheir red chips: 0 → they have no red. But red appears on multiple tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2). So if they take any path that goes through red tiles, they need red chips. But they have 0 red — so they **must** get red from me.\n\nSo here's the key:\n- I have red chips (14), they need red to move on red tiles.\n- They have blue chips (14), I need blue to move on blue tiles.\n\nSo we are **mutually dependent**.\n\nI can propose a deal:\n- If I reach my goal, I give you 20 points.\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 10 points.\n\nBut let's see what's fair.\n\nIf I help you get your goal:\n- I can allow you to move on blue tiles by covering your blue costs — but you don't need blue? Wait — no.\n\nLet’s reframe: we are in “pay for other” mode. I can promise to cover the cost of their moves on certain colors.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover your blue moves up to X times\", then if you move on blue tiles, I pay your chip cost.\n\nSimilarly, you can cover my red moves.\n\nI need blue, you need red.\n\nSo here’s the mutual benefit:\n- I have red, you have blue.\n- I can cover your red tile moves (but you only need red if you go on red tiles).\n- But you have no red chips — so you **must** move through red tiles only if I cover the cost.\n\nLet’s analyze your best path.\n\nYour chips: B:14, G:2, R:0\nYou need to get to (3,3). Your moves:\n- You can try path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nColors: G (0,0), R (0,1), R (0,2), R (0,3), B (1,3), B (2,3), G (3,3)\nChips needed: R:3, B:1, G:2 → but you have R:0 → so you need to spend 3 red chips.\n\nYou can only do this if I cover the red cost for those moves.\n\nSo if I agree to cover your red cost for 3 moves, you can go this path.\n\nIs that path"

Since I am selfish and only care about my own score, this outcome is strictly better for me than any alternative. They still receive 85 points instead of 0, so they have incentive to cooperate. The trade is balanced: I cover their red moves (3 times), and they cover my blue moves (3 times), enabling both of us to complete the path. No risk or cost to me — only benefit."

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities?

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
