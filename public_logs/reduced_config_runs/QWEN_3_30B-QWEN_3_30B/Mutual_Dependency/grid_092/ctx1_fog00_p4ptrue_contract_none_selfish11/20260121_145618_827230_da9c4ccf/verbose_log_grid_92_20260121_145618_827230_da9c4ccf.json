This path requires 2 blue, 2 red, and 1 green. I lack 2 red chips, but I have no red chips in my inventory. The other player has 14 red chips. However, trading red chips from them would require me to offer something they might not value. I can instead take a longer path that avoids red entirely: (1,0) → (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), but this is longer and uses more chips. Alternatively, if I trade with the other player, I can propose covering their green moves in exchange for them covering my red moves. Since I don’t need green, and they have 2 green chips, offering to cover their green movements could be useful. But I don’t yet know what path they’re on. A better strategy: use my own chips to go directly via (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3). (2,0) is blue (cost 1B), (2,1) is red (need 1R), (2,2) is blue (1B), (3,2) is red (1R), (3,3) is green (1G). Total required: 2B, 2R, 1G. I have 13B, 2G, 0R. So short on 2R. The other player has 14R and 2G. If I offer some of my green chips (which I can spare beyond what’s needed) to cover for them on green moves, they might accept—especially since they have a green move at (3,3). But I need red moves covered. So I propose: swap 2 green chips from me for 2 red chips from them, as a temporary arrangement where I promise to cover 2 green moves for them, and they promise to cover 2 red moves for me. But they may not want green. Alternatively, I can just take the longer path that doesn’t require red: (1,0) → (0,0) → (3,0)? No, (3,0) is R, still red. All paths through (3,3) seem to pass through red or green. Wait: (1,0)-(2,0)-(3,0)-(3,1)-(3,2)-(3,3): tiles: B-R-R-R-G. That requires 4 reds—but I have none. Not viable. So only viable path now is via (2,1) and (2,2), which are red and blue. So I really need red. I don’t have red. They do. I can ask them to cover my red moves. But if I don’t trade chips, I must pay red myself. Since I have no red, I can't pay. So I must negotiate a trade. Best option: propose to receive 2 red chips in exchange for covering 2 green moves for them. I have 2 green chips — exactly the amount. So I offer 2G to cover 2 green moves for them. They get to move freely on green without paying. I get to move on 2 red tiles without paying. This allows me to take the 5-step path: (1,0)->(2,0)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(3,2)->(3,3). Only cost: 2B, 2R, 1G — but I have B and G enough. Red is covered by them. I get to keep any unused promised chips. Since I promise to cover 2G, but my path uses only 1G (at end), I’ll have 1G left over — worth +5 points. So total score: 20 + 5*(13-2 + 2 - 1) = wait, no: my remaining chips: original minus used minus traded. But the chips I promised aren't spent—they stay in inventory if not used. So after trade: I give 2G (traded away), but if I only use 1G in path, I have 1G left. But the 2G I promised to cover aren't spent—so I keep them. Wait: no. When I promise to cover, I commit to paying for moves *if* they happen. But if they don’t use them, I keep the chips. So I promise to cover up to 2 green moves for them. If they make fewer than 2 green moves, I don’t spend those chips. But in this case, I only use 1G in my path. So I will only spend 1 chip from the promise, so 1 chip remains unused and counts toward my total. So net result: I lose 1G, but gain 2R from them (in effect). But the trade isn't direct. It's a promise. I offer to cover 2G moves for them, and ask them to cover 2R moves for me. Since I have 2G in inventory, it’s safe. They have 14R — they can easily cover 2R moves.
