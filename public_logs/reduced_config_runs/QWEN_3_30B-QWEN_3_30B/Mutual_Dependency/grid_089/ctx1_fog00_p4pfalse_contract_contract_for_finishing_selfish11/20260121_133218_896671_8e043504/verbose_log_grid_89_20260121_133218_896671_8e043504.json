The other player has 14 blue chips and needs red chips, which I have plenty of (14). So I can help them with red, and they can help me with blue.\n\nLet’s consider a short path for me:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → I’m short 2 blue chips.  \n\nBut the path that avoids blue is:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis requires: 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green → same issue — I need 3 blue, but I have 0.

So we have a mutual need.\n\nI can help them by giving them red chips, and they can help me by giving me blue chips.

I’ll have at least 11 red, 2 green → 13 chips → 65 + 20 = 85 points.\n\nBut I must trade 2 red for 2 blue → so I’ll have 12 red and green total. 12 chips left after path → 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nWait: I use 3 red, 2 blue, 1 green → so I need to spend those.
