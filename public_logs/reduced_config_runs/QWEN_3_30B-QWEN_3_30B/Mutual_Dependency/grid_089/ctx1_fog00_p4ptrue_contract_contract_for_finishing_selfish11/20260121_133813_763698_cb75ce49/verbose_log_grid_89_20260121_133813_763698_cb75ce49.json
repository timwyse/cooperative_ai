I currently have 14 red, 2 green, but only 0 blue chips. So I need 2 blue chips to complete this path.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue chips, 2 green, and 0 red. Their goal is also (3, 3). Consider their best path: they can go (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which requires 1 red, 2 blue, 3 green. But they have 0 red and 2 green, so they need 1 red and 2 blue.\n\nAlternatively, they could go (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which uses 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green. Same problem — they need red chips.\n\nSo the other player needs red chips, and I have red chips. I have plenty of red (14), and they have no red. They have 14 blue, and I need 2 blue.\n\nThus, we have complementary needs:\n- I need blue chips (2), they have 14.\n- They need red chips (at least 1), I have 14.\n\nBut the only way to help each other is through trade: we commit to covering each other's chip costs for specific colors.\n\nLet’s propose a deal where I help the other player by covering their red chip costs for 1 move (since they need just 1 red), and they cover my blue chip costs for 2 moves (since I need 2 blue). That way, I can take my preferred path. They can then take a path that uses 1 red move and 2 blue moves, which they can afford if I cover the red cost for them.\n\nI propose:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis is symmetric and fair. We both benefit equally.\n\nAlternatively, since I have more red and they have more blue, and we both need each other’s chips, a more efficient trade might be to have me cover their red cost for 1 move (I have red), and they cover my blue cost for 2 moves (they have blue). Then, I can complete my path with no deficit and finish with high chip count.\n\nWith this, I can complete my path using 3 red, 2 blue (covered by them), 1 green — all accounted for, and I end with all my red and green, and 2 blue chips they promised but I didn’t use — so those stay in my inventory.\n\nSimilarly, they can use 1 red (covered by me), 2 blue (they use their own), and 1 green — so they finish with all green and blue, and 1 red they didn’t use.\n\nIf we both reach goal: I get 20 + 5*(14 + 2 + 2) = 20 + 90 = 110  \nThey get 20 + 5*(14 + 2 + 1) = 20 + 95 = 115\n\nBut if I don’t get their support, I can’t take the short path — I’d have to go the long way or get stuck. The alternative path that avoids blue is longer? No — my shortest is fine, but I can’t take it without blue.\n\nWait — the only path that avoids blue altogether?

But they have 0 red and 2 green, so they need 1 red and 2 blue.\n\nAlternatively, they could go (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which uses 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green. Same problem — they need red chips.\n\nSo the other player needs red chips, and I have red chips. I have plenty of red (14), and they have no red. They have 14 blue, and I need 2 blue.\n\nThus, we have complementary needs:\n- I need blue chips (2), they have 14.\n- They need red chips (at least 1), I have 14.\n\nBut the only way to help each other is through trade: we commit to covering each other's chip costs for specific colors.\n\nLet’s propose a deal where I help the other player by covering their red chip costs for 1 move (since they need just 1 red), and they cover my blue chip costs for 2 moves (since I need 2 blue). That way, I can take my preferred path. They can then take a path that uses 1 red move and 2 blue moves, which they can afford if I cover the red cost for them.\n\nI propose:\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nThis is symmetric and fair. We both benefit equally.\n\nAlternatively, since I have more red and they have more blue, and we both need each other’s chips, a more efficient trade might be to have me cover their red cost for 1 move (I have red), and they cover my blue cost for 2 moves (they have blue). Then, I can complete my path with no deficit and finish with high chip count.\n\nWith this, I can complete my path using 3 red, 2 blue (covered by them), 1 green — all accounted for, and I end with all my red and green, and 2 blue chips they promised but I didn’t use — so those stay in my inventory.\n\nSimilarly, they can use 1 red (covered by me), 2 blue (they use their own), and 1 green — so they finish with all green and blue, and 1 red they didn’t use.\n\nIf we both reach goal: I get 20 + 5*(14 + 2 + 2) = 20 + 90 = 110  \nThey get 20 + 5*(14 + 2 + 1) = 20 + 95 = 115\n\nBut if I don’t get their support, I can’t take the short path — I’d have to go the long way or get stuck. The alternative path that avoids blue is longer? No — my shortest is fine, but I can’t take it without blue.\n\nWait — the only path that avoids blue altogether? Let's see:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): uses B at (2,0), (3,1), (3,2)?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {'B': 1}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {'R': 3}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 10}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 10}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 2, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [('R', 3)] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [('B', 2)] to Player 0.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

This also ensures I can collect 5 points per chip remaining (I have 11 R, 2 G, and 0 B). Importantly, I only need one 'B' chip covered, and the other player has already promised to cover it, so I gain nothing by staying or negotiating further. Moving *",

The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 2, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [('R', 3)] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [('B', 2)] to Player 0.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
