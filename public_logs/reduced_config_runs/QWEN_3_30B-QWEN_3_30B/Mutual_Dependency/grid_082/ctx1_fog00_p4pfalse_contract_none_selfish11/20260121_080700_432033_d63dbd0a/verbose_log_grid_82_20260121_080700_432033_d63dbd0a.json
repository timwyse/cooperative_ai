I need another red, but I only had 1 left — so would be stuck.\n\nAlternatively, consider path: (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\nTile colours:\n- (2,1): B (needs 1 blue)\n- (3,1): R (1 red)\n- (3,2): R (1 red)\n- (3,3): G (1 green)\n\nChips required: B:1, R:2, G:1\nMy inventory: B:8, R:2, G:2 → I have all of them!\nTherefore, this path is fully feasible with no trading needed — and I end with: \n- B:7, R:0, G:1 → total 8 chips remaining\n\nThis gives me 20 + 5×8 = 60 points if I reach goal.\n\nNow compare to the other path: going through (3,0) first? That path requires 3 red chips, but I only have 2 → not enough even for two moves. So I can't safely take that route unless I trade.\n\nThus, the best option is to take (2,0) → (2,1), since it’s a full-path viable route without needing to trade.\n\nI should move to (2,1) now. It’s blue — I have 8 blue chips → easily affordable.\n\nLater moves: (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) are all affordable with remaining blue (7), red (2), green (2).\n\nAlso note: the other player has 11 red chips — they’re flush in red. If I were to propose a trade for red, I could get red cheaply, but since I can avoid trading entirely with this safe path, there’s zero benefit to trading. In fact, trading would reduce my chip count and possibly delay progress.\n\nHence, I strongly prefer the (2,0) → (2,1) path.\n\nMoreover, the other player is already at (2,0), so we're both starting from same point — if they attempt to go down (3,0), that might help me indirectly, but it doesn’t affect my ability to go right to (2,1) first.",
