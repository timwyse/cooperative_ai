However, the other player has 14 red chips and is at (0,0) with the same goal. If I propose a deal where they cover my red chip costs for 3 moves (since I need 3 red tiles) in exchange for me covering their green or blue moves, it could be beneficial. But crucially, I don't need to trade: there is an alternative path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] requiring {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1} — I’m short on 2 red chips again. Both paths require red chips I lack. Since the other player has all 14 red chips, I can propose a trade where they cover my red moves for 2 or 3 steps in exchange for me covering their green or blue moves, but since I don’t want to give away excess chips unnecessarily and must strictly benefit, I need to evaluate if the trade improves my final score. However, I can take a longer path avoiding red entirely? No — all viable paths use red or blue. Wait: no path avoids red entirely. All shortest paths go through red tiles. Therefore, I must trade. But note: I have no red chips to offer. So I cannot offer red. But I could accept being covered for red by them. That would save me 3 red chip cost. If they agree to cover my red movements (e.g., 3 times), I can use such a path and finish with more chips than if I had to pay from my inventory. Since they want to reach their goal too, they might agree to cover my red moves in exchange for me covering some of their green or blue moves on their path. However, I currently have 2 green chips — I could help them cover green moves. They need green chips? Their inventory: G:2, so they have 2 green chips. If I propose: 'I’ll cover up to 2 green moves for you if you cover my 3 red moves'. Then I get 3 red moves covered, saving 3 red chips from my inventory (though I have none). So I gain 3 red chips in savings. But I don't have any red chips anyway. So my final score depends only on how many chips I end with. If I never spend any red chips because they cover them, I keep all my 14 blue and 2 green. But if I have to pay red, I can’t. So by getting red moved for free via their coverage, I can finish with 16 chips. Same if I don’t trade — I can’t reach goal without red chips. So I must trade. But I don’t want to send empty promises. So I propose: let them cover my red moves for 3 steps (since 3 red tiles are in the main path) and in return I promise to cover their green moves for 2 steps (since I have 2 green chips). This gives me access to red tiles without spending anything. My total chips at end will be (14 B + 2 G) + 3 R promised = 19. If I don’t trade, I can’t move. So I must trade. But I can’t offer red chips because I have none. So I must rely on them covering me for red. But trading is mutual. So I must receive green or blue in return. But I don’t want to lose my green chips. But I can offer to cover their green moves. But I have 2 green chips — not enough to cover 3 moves. But perhaps I can suggest covering 2 green moves.
