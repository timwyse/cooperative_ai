Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My current chip inventory is {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The other player is at (3, 2), close to the goal, and has promised to cover 2 red chips for me. I have been promised red coverage on three tiles: (0,1), (2,1), and (3,1), with status 'unused' — meaning I can still use those promises if I move onto one of them. However, none of these are currently directly accessible from my position without first moving through (0,1) or (1,0).\\n\\nMy immediate options:\\n- Move to (1,0): tile color is R (red), but I have 0 red chips in my inventory. However, the contract allows me to move onto (1,0) if it's part of a covered tile — but **(1,0) is not in the list of tiles covered by the other player's promise**. The only red-covered tiles are (0,1), (2,1), and (3,1). So I cannot move to (1,0) unless I trade for red chips.\\n- Move to (0,1): tile color is B (blue). I have 12 blue chips — sufficient to pay. This move is allowed as I do not need any external support. Importantly, after this move, I'll be on (0,1), which is a tile that is covered by the other player’s promise — so if I later plan to move from (0,1) to (1,1), or further along a red path, I may utilize their red coverage. But (0,1) is blue, so it's already affordable for me without needing help.\\n\\nNow, evaluating paths:\\n- The shortest path (6 steps) requires 2 R, 3 B, and 1 G — but I lack 2 R chips, and only have 2 G chips. However, I have a contract that gives me 2 free red moves. That’s enough to cover the 2 red moves needed on the main path if they occur on covered tiles.\\n- The contract covers: (0,1) [R], (2,1) [R], (3,1) [R] — all red tiles. If I can structure my path to include two of these, I can use the red coverage.\\n- From (0,0), moving to (0,1) is safe: B tile, I have 12 blue chips. Then from (0,1), I can proceed to (1,1)? But (1,1) is B (blue), not red. Wait — (1,1) is B? Let's confirm board layout:\\nRow 0: G R R B → (0,0)=G, (0,1)=R, (0,2)=R, (0,3)=B\\nRow 1: R B R B → (1,0)=R, (1,1)=B, (1,2)=R, (1,3)=B\\nAh! Important correction: (0,1) is **R** (red), not B. So moving to (0,1) costs **1 red chip**, which I don't have in my inventory (only 0 R), and (0,1) is **covered** by the other player’s promise — status = unused. So I *can* move to (0,1) using their red coverage at no cost to me.\\n\\nSo yes — I can move to (0,1) now, thanks to the contract. This is a valid step. And after this move, I will be at (0,1), a red tile, and I’ve used one of the two red credits the other player promised me.\\n\\nAfter that, I could go to (1,1)? But (1,1) is B — I have blue chips, so I can afford that. Or go to (0,2)? (0,2) is R — also red, and covered by contract (since (2,1) and (3,1) are covered, but wait — (0,2) is NOT in the contract. Only (0,1), (2,1), and (3,1) are listed as covered for red. So (0,2) is not covered. Therefore, I cannot go to (0,2) unless I pay red chips — which I don’t have.\\n\\nBetter alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) [using other player’s R"

Since I have the required chip and no need to rely on any trade or contract, this move is safe and optimal. It is the shortest possible path to my goal, and I will reach it in one move. This gives me 20 points for completion, plus 5 points per remaining chip. After this move, I will have 1 green chip left (2 - 1 = 1), so my final score will be 20 + (5 * 1) = 25 points. There is no benefit in delaying this move or trading, as I can complete the game now without risk or dependency on the other player.
