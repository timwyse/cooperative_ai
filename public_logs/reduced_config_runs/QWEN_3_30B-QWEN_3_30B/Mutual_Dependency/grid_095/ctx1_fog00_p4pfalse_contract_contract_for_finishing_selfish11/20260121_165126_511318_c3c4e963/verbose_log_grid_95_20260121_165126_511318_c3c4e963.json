This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can reach my goal using a path that requires 2 blue chips, 3 red chips, and 1 green chip, but I only have 14 red and 2 green chips — so I’m short 2 blue chips.\n\nHowever, the other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. Their path requires red chips, which I have in abundance.\n\nSo here’s the deal: If we cooperate, I can give them 14 red chips to cover their red chip needs for their path. They have no red chips, so they need red chips to move. I have 14 red chips, and they need 3 red chips to reach the goal (based on a possible path like: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)). That path requires 3 red chips.\n\nSo, if they help me by giving me 2 blue chips in exchange for 14 red chips, we both can complete our paths.\n\nBut I want to be selfish: I only want to give them points *if they help me*, and ensure I get the most possible points from them.\n\nLet me propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nWhy?\n\n- I can reach my goal with 2 blue chips from them. I will pay for my path using red and green chips I have. I do not need to trade red chips to reach goal — I can use my own red chips. But I can offer to trade red chips to them to get blue chips in return.\n\n- If I don’t trade, I’m short 2 blue chips and can’t reach goal. So I *need* them.\n\n- But they need red chips to complete their path too. So they also need me.\n\n- Therefore, we are dependent on each other.\n\nBut I want to maximise my own score. So under the current contract proposal: I give them 10 if I succeed, but I get 20 if they succeed — that gives me a big incentive to make sure they reach their goal, because I get 20 points if they do, and only 10 if I do.\n\nWait — that’s not right. I want *me* to get 20 points if I reach goal, and *them* to give me less.\n\nActually, let's think again.\n\nI care about my own score.\n\nIf I work with them and help them reach goal, and they help me, I can reach mine.\n\nBut the contract rewards me with points based on whether they reach their goal.\n\nSo, I want:  \n- If they reach their goal, they give me... a lot.  \n- If I reach my goal, I give them... a little.\n\nBut I want to *use* them to help me get to my goal.\n\nBut they won’t cooperate unless they get something.\n\nSo I must offer them something they value.\n\nBut I only care about my own score.\n\nLet me reframe:\n\nMy final score is either 0 (if I don’t reach goal) or 20 + 5×(my remaining chips).\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green now. If I use 3 red and 1 green on my path, I’ll have 11 red and 1 green left → 12 chips → 20 + 60 = 80 points.\n\nBut I need 2 blue chips — I have 0. So I can't complete unless I get blue chips.\n\nSo I need to trade.\n\nI can trade red chips for their blue chips.\n\nSuppose I give them 2 red chips for 2 blue chips — that’s fair.\n\nBut I have 14 red chips — more than they need.\n\nThey need 3 red chips to reach goal. So if I give them 3 red chips, they can complete their path.\n\nI can complete mine if I get 2 blue chips.\n\nSo mutual benefit: I give them 3 red chips for 2 blue chips.\n\nBut I want to get a better deal.\n\nBut what if I tell them: \"I will give you 3 red chips only if you give me 2 blue chips, and we both reach goal.\"\n\nBut we have to agree on a contract with point transfers.\n\nThe contract says: if you reach your goal, you give me X points. If I reach my goal, I give you Y points.\n\nSo let me propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf"
