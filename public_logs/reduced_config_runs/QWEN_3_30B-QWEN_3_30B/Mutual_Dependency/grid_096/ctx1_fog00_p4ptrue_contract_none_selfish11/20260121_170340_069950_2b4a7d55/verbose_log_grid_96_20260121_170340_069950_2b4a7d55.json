The shortest path is [(2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], but I cannot take (3, 0) because it's B and I have 0 B chips. Alternatively, from (2, 0) to (2, 1) is R — I have 12 R chips, so that’s feasible. From (2, 1) to (3, 1) is B — I don’t have any B chips, but the other player has promised to cover 1 B chip move for me. That means I can move onto (3, 1) using their promise. Then from (3, 1) to (3, 2) is R — I have 12 R chips, so no problem. Finally, (3, 2) to (3, 3) is G — I have 2 G chips, so possible. However, notice: I am already at (2, 0), so moving to (2, 1) requires a R chip — I have plenty. After that, I can use the other player’s coverage for the B at (3, 1). This allows me to continue toward goal efficiently without needing to trade more. Even if they later don’t cover anything else, I still have a way to get to goal: (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) [covered by them] → (3,2) → (3,3). I will not lose anything by taking this route; in fact, I gain by progressing toward goal while preserving my chips. Moreover, I currently have 12 R and 2 G — if I go via the shorter path ((2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)), I’ll spend only 2 R, 1 B (covered), 1 G — total consumption of 4 chips (1 R, 1 G, 1 covered B). But since I already have enough R and G, and the B is covered, I can proceed safely. Importantly, if I delay or avoid this move, I risk losing time and potentially having no access to the necessary chips later. No better path avoids this bottleneck.

The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 1, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [('R', 2)] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [('B', 2)] to Player 0.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move.
