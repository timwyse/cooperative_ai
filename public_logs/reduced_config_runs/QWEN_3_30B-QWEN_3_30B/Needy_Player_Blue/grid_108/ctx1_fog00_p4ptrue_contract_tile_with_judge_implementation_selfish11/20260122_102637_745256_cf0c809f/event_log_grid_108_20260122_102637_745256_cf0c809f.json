          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I notice that we are both starting at (0, 0) and both aiming for (3, 3). My current chip inventory is {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}, and the other player has {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. \n\nLooking at the board:\n- My best path without trading is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n  - This path uses: R (on (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)) → 5 R chips needed, and G (on (2,2)) → 1 G chip needed.\n  - I have 14 R chips and 2 G chips → I can cover this entire path without help.\n\nBut I can’t use that path for negotiation: it requires only chips I already have. So I can’t benefit from a trade. \n\nNow consider the other path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Color costs: \n  - (0,1): B\n  - (0,2): B\n  - (1,2): B\n  - (2,2): R\n  - (3,2): B\n  - (3,3): G\n- Total: B: 4, R: 1, G: 1\n\nI have 0 B chips, so I can’t make this path on my own.\n\nThe other player has 14 B chips, which they could potentially help with.\n\nBut here's the key: the other player cannot take this path either — they have 0 R chips, but need 1 R (at (2,2)), so they cannot complete it without help from me.\n\nSo if we both want to go through (2,2), we’ll need help.\n\nNow, can we cooperate such that *I* get R and G from them, and *they* get B from me?\n\nBut wait — I have no B chips. I have R and G.\n\nThey have B, G, but no R.\n\nSo if I help them with B, I can get R or G from them.\n\nBut I need R for my path. They need R for their path.\n\nWait — I can go through the first path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3)\n\n- Tiles: \n  - (1,0): R → need R\n  - (2,0): R → R\n  - (2,1): R → R\n  - (2,2): R → R\n  - (2,3): R → R\n  - (3,3): G → G\n\nI have 14 R and 2 G → I can cover this path entirely.\n\nSo I don't need any trade to succeed.\n\nBut the other player? Let’s check their path options.\n\nTheir chip inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nThey need to reach (3,3). Let's find their best path.\n\nOption 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B → B\n- (0,2): B → B\n- (1,2): B → B\n- (2,2): R → R → they have 0 R → cannot do this\n- (3,2): B → B\n- (3,3): G → G\n\n→ requires R at (2,2), they don't have R → stuck.\n\nOption 2: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R → R → they don’t have R → need R\n- (2,0): R → R\n- (2,1): R → R\n- (2,2): R → R\n- (2,3): R → R\n- (3,3): G → G\n\nAll these require R → they have 0 R → cannot go this way.\n\nOption 3 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I see that the other player cannot complete any path to (3, 3) without help, because all viable paths require at least one R chip (on tiles (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), or (2,3)), and they have 0 R chips. They have 14 B and 2 G, but no R.\n\nMy path: I can go straight to (3,3) via (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), requiring 5 R and 1 G. I have 14 R and 2 G → fully covered. No need to trade.\n\nBut they are stuck. They cannot complete any path.\n\nHowever, if I want to *benefit* from a trade, I must be able to get more chips than I would if I didn’t trade — but I can already complete my path with 5 R and 1 G used, leaving me with 9 R and 1 G → final score: 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nBut if I can somehow trade for a better route that uses fewer chips, or gets me more chips at the end — that would be better.\n\nWait — is there a shorter path? Both paths are length 6, so same number of moves.\n\nBut let's look again at the alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis path needs: B (4 times), R (1), G (1)\n\nI have 0 B, 0 R, 1 G → I can’t take it without help.\n\nBut the other player has 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nSo if I go this path, I need:\n- B: 4 → they can provide\n- R: 1 → they can’t help me with R (they have 0), but I have R\n\nWait — I have R chips. But I don’t need them for this path.\n\nBut the other player needs R chips. So if I send them R chips via trade, they can go this path.\n\nBut I don’t need R for this path — so I can give them R, and they give me B.\n\nThat could work.\n\nBut: I need R for myself? I do — I have 14 R, but if I use them to trade, I lose them.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nSuppose I propose a joint path via (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles and colors:\n- (0,1): B → I need B\n- (0,2): B → I need B\n- (1,2): B → I need B\n- (2,2): R → I need R\n- (3,2): B → I need B\n- (3,3): G → I need G\n\nThat’s 4 B, 1 R, 1 G → total 6 chips needed.\n\nI have: 14 B? No — I have B:14? Wait no:\n\nWait — check initial status:\n\nMy chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nOh! I made a critical mistake earlier.\n\nMy inventory: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nOther player: B:0, G:2, R:14\n\nSo I have **14 B chips**, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nI do NOT have R chips.\n\nBut earlier I thought I had R — no, I have R:0.\n\nSo I cannot go the R-heavy path.\n\nI can only go a path that uses B and G.\n\nSo let's re-evaluate.\n\nMy path options:\n\nOption 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R → need R → I have 0 R → can't\n- (2,0): R → R → I have 0 R → can't\n\nSo I cannot take this path.\n\nOption 2: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2 \n, \nplayer 0: I have made a critical error in my initial assessment — let me correct it immediately.\n\n**Corrected Game Status:**\n\n- My chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}  \n- Other player's chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}  \n\nThis changes everything.\n\nI have **14 B**, 2 G, and **0 R**.\nOther player has 0 B, 2 G, 14 R.\n\nMy goal: (3,3)\nOther player's goal: (3,3)\n\nI cannot take any path that requires R, because I have 0 R chips.\n\nSo let’s evaluate possible paths for me.\n\n### Path 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B → B needed\n- (0,2): B → B\n- (1,2): B → B\n- (2,2): R → R needed (I have 0) → **cannot go**\n- (3,2): B → B\n- (3,3): G → G\n\n→ Requires R at (2,2). I have 0 R → cannot use.\n\n### Path 2: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B → B\n- (0,2): B → B\n- (0,3): B → B\n- (1,3): B → B\n- (2,3): R → R → I have 0 R → cannot go\n- (3,3): G → G\n\n→ Requires R at (2,3) → I can't go.\n\n### Path 3: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R → R → I have 0 → can't go\n\n### Path 4: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- (0,1): B → B\n- (1,1): R → R → I have 0 → can't go\n\nEvery path to (3,3) must pass through one of the following tiles: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,1), etc.\n\nBut the critical point is: the only tile where the color is R on the way to (3,3) is:\n- (1,0): R\n- (2,0): R\n- (2,1): R\n- (2,2): R\n- (2,3): R\n- (3,2): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nSo any path that goes through any of (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) requires R, and I have 0 R.\n\nIs there a path that avoids all R tiles?\n\nLet’s look carefully.\n\nFrom (0,0) → (0,1): B → ok, I have B\n(0,1) → (0,2): B → ok\n(0,2) → (0,3): B → ok\n(0,3): B → ok\n(0,3) → (1,3): B → (1,3): B? Row 1: R R B B → so (1,3): B → yes → ok\n(1,3) → (2,3): R → (2,3): R → I have 0 R → cannot go\n\n(1,3) → (1,2): B → ok\n(1,2) → (2,2): R → cannot\n\n(0,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1): (1,1): R → R → I can't go\n\n(1,1) → (2,1): R → R → can't\n\n(1,0): R → can't\n\nSo the **only** R-free paths would have to avoid all R tiles.\n\nBut (3, \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: Let me carefully reevaluate all possible paths from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoid any R-colored tile.\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R R B B  \nRow 2: R R R R  \nRow 3: R B B G  \n\nTiles with color:\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,0): R\n- (1,1): R\n- (1,2): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (2,0): R\n- (2,1): R\n- (2,2): R\n- (2,3): R\n- (3,0): R\n- (3,1): B\n- (3,2): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nNow, I need to go from (0,0) to (3,3) without stepping on any R tile — because I have 0 R chips and cannot pay for R.\n\nBut: (0,0) is G — okay.\n\nFrom (0,0), I can only move to (0,1) [B] or (1,0) [R].\n\n(1,0) is R → cannot go.\n\nSo only option is (0,1): B → okay.\n\nFrom (0,1): B → can go to (0,2): B → ok\n\nFrom (0,2): B → to (0,3): B → ok\n\nFrom (0,3): B → can go to (1,3): B → ok (since (1,3) is B)\n\nFrom (1,3): B → can go to (2,3): R → R → I have no R → cannot go\n\nFrom (1,3) → (1,2): B → ok\n\nFrom (1,2): B → can go to (2,2): R → R → cannot go\n\nNowhere to go from (1,2) except back or to R tiles.\n\nFrom (0,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → dead end.\n\nIs there a path down the right side?\n\n(0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1): R → cannot go\n\n(1,2) → (1,1): R → no\n\nSo the only way down is to go (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3)? → R → can't.\n\nNo path from top row to (3,3) without passing through an R tile? Let's list all tiles that are R:\n\nAll of row 2: (2,0) to (2,3): R  \nAll of row 1: (1,0), (1,1): R  \nRow 3: (3,0): R  \nSo the only non-R tiles are:\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,2): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (3,1): B\n- (3,2): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nNow, can I go from (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → now at (1,2)\n\nFrom (1,2), only connections: (0,2), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2)\n\nAll of which are: (0,2): B → ok, (1,1): R → blocked, (1,3): B → ok, (2,2): R → blocked.\n\nSo no way forward.\n\nCan I go down from (3,2) to (3,3)? Yes, but how to get to (3,2)?\n\n(3,2): B, (3,1): B, (3,0): R → so (3,1) is B, but only connected to (3,0) [R] and (3,2) [B]\n\n(3,0) is R → blocked\n\nSo (3,1) is isolated — only reachable from (3,0) or (3,2), both of which are blocked.\n\nSo (3,1) and (3,2) are only accessible from above or below, but no path exists to them.\n\nWait — (2,1): R → \n, \nplayer 0: I now see the critical issue: **there is no path from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids all R-colored tiles.**\n\nAll possible paths to (3,3) must pass through at least one R tile, because:\n\n- The only non-R tiles in the bottom rows are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) in row 3.\n- (3,0) is R, so (3,1) is only connected to (3,0) and (2,1).\n- (2,1) is R → cannot be entered by me.\n- (3,2) is connected to (3,1) [B] and (2,2) [R] → both blocked.\n- (2,2) is R → blocked.\n\nThus, (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are only reachable from above via R tiles — all blocked.\n\nThe only access to row 3 is from (2,3) [R] or (3,0) [R] — both R tiles.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot reach (3,3) without stepping on an R tile.**\n\nBut I have 0 R chips — so I cannot afford to pay for any R tile.\n\nTherefore, **my path to goal is impossible unless I receive help from the other player.**\n\nThe other player has 14 R chips — they can cover my R payments.\n\nBut I have B and G chips — they have 0 B and only 2 G — so I cannot help them with B or G; they need R, and I have 0 R.\n\nWait — let’s double-check:\n\n- I have: B:14, G:2, R:0\n- They have: B:0, G:2, R:14\n\nSo I can give them B or G chips, but they need R — I can't give them R.\n\nBut I need R to move.\n\nSo the **only way I can survive** is if they **cover my R costs**.\n\nIn exchange, I can give them B or G.\n\nBut they have 0 B and 2 G — they can’t *use* my B or G unless they need them.\n\nBut do they need a path using B or G?\n\nLet’s check their position: (0,0), goal (3,3)\n\nTheir chip inventory: B:0, G:2, R:14\n\nThey have no B chips.\n\nDo they have any path that avoids R? No — same problem: all paths go through R tiles.\n\nIn fact, they *must* pass through R tiles, and they have 14 R chips — so they can cover R costs.\n\nBut do they need to use B or G?\n\nLet’s see: path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (1,0): R → they can pay\n- (2,0): R → R\n- (2,1): R → R\n- (2,2): R → R\n- (2,3): R → R\n- (3,3): G → G\n\nThey have 2 G → can cover (3,3) with G.\n\nBut (0,0) is G — they start there → need to pay for (0,0)? No — pay only when you move *to* a tile.\n\nInitial: at (0,0) → no cost to enter.\n\nThen:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): move to R → pay 1 R → they have 14 → ok\n- (1,0) → (2,0): R → pay R → ok\n- (2,0) → (2,1): R → ok\n- (2,1) → (2,2): R → ok\n- (2,2) → (2,3): R → ok\n- (2,3) → (3,3): G → they have 2 G → can pay\n\nSo they can go this path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), using 5 R and 1 G.\n\nThey have 14 R and 2 G — so they can do it.\n\nBut I cannot.\n\nSo **only I am blocked** — the other player can reach the goal on their own.\n\nBut if I want to reach the goal, I must get R chips from them.\n\nBut they have 14 R — if they pay for my \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: I now see the critical point: **I am blocked from reaching (3,3) unless I receive assistance from the other player for R-colored tiles.**\n\nThe other player can reach (3,3) on their own using 5 R and 1 G (path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)).\n\nBut I cannot take that path because I have 0 R chips.\n\nThe only way I can move is by getting the other player to **cover the cost of any R tile I step on**.\n\nI must ask them to cover R costs for specific tiles.\n\nBut I can only benefit if this enables me to reach the goal — and I must gain more than if I didn't trade.\n\nCurrently, without trade: I cannot reach goal → 0 points.\n\nWith trade: if I can reach goal, I get 20 + 5 × (remaining chips).\n\nSo I will only cooperate if I can reach goal *and* end up with more chips than I would otherwise.\n\nBut to reach goal, I must pass through R tiles.\n\nThe shortest path for me must include at least one R tile.\n\nLet’s find a path that uses as few R tiles as possible — but I can’t avoid them.\n\nAll paths go through R.\n\nBut I need the other player to cover the R cost.\n\nBut the other player wants to maximize their score too.\n\nThey are going to go down the middle — they can do it with 5 R and 1 G.\n\nBut I might take a different path.\n\nSuppose I go: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1): B → I can pay (I have 14 B)\n- (0,2): B → B\n- (0,3): B → B\n- (1,3): B → B\n- (1,2): B → B\n- (2,2): R → I need help\n- (3,2): B → B\n- (3,3): G → G\n\nSo I need to cover: B: 6 (from (0,1) to (1,2) and (3,2)), G:1 (at (3,3)), and R:1 at (2,2)\n\nI have B:14, G:2 → I can cover B and G myself — only R at (2,2) is problematic.\n\nSo if the other player agrees to cover **one R** at (2,2), I can go this path.\n\nThis path uses only **1 R tile**, so I only need help for one tile.\n\nI will use:\n- 6 B chips\n- 1 G chip\n- 1 R chip via trade (covered by other player)\n\nAfter: I have 14 - 6 = 8 B → 8 left\nG: 2 - 1 = 1 G left\nR: 0 (but I was promised 1 R by other player, so I get to use it)\n\nAt end: I have 8 B, 1 G, and the 1 R that was promised but not used → that R chip (from other player) remains in my inventory → counts toward my score.\n\nSo final chips: B:8, G:1, R:1 → total 10 chips.\n\nScore: 20 + 5×10 = 20 + 50 = 70\n\nNow, what does the other player gain?\n\nThey are going to pay for my move to (2,2) — one R chip.\n\nThey have 14 R → they will have 13 R left.\n\nBut do they care? They will save their own chips.\n\nBut they also want to maximize their own score.\n\nLet’s see: they can go their own path: 5 R and 1 G used → end with 9 R and 1 G → total 10 chips → score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nSame as me.\n\nBut I can offer them something in return — for covering my R cost, I can give them my excess B or G.\n\nBut they don’t need B — they have 0 B, but they don’t need to use B.\n\nUnless I can help them avoid spending R or G.\n\nBut they are already using 5 R and 1 G — no way around it.\n\nSo I cannot help them avoid cost.\n\nBut perhaps I can **give them B chips \n, \nplayer 0: I now propose a contract to the other player:\n\nYou are at (0, 0), goal is (3, 3). I have a path that requires only **one R** chip — on tile (2,2). You can cover this for me.\n\nIn exchange, I will give you 6 B chips (from my surplus) and 1 G chip (from mine), which you may use or keep. But since you have no need for B (you have 0), and only 2 G already, giving you more G won’t help you.\n\nBut if I promise you **6 B chips** in total, but I don’t need to use them — they remain in your inventory if not used — so you gain 6 B chips as part of the trade.\n\nWait — let’s clarify: in pay-for-other mode, when I “give” you B chips, it means **you commit to covering my B moves** — no.\n\nLet’s read the rules carefully:\n\n> - If you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\n\n> - When an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement.\n\nSo if I say:\n- (row, col): You give me a R\n- (row, col): I give you a B\n\nThat means:\n- When I step on (2,2) [R], *you* pay the R chip.\n- When you step on a B-tile, *I* pay the B chip.\n\nBut you have 0 B chips — so you cannot pay for B tiles anyway.\n\nBut if you agree to let me cover your B costs, I must be able to pay — I have 14 B → yes.\n\nBut do you need me to cover any of your costs?\n\nYou plan to go down the middle: path requiring 5 R and 1 G.\n\nYou have 14 R and 2 G → you can cover everything yourself.\n\nBut perhaps we can negotiate a better deal.\n\nAlternative idea: I can propose that *for one R tile at (2,2)*, you cover the cost.\n\nIn return, you get **my promise to cover your B costs on certain tiles**, but you don't need B.\n\nUnless you want to take a different path.\n\nWhat if we both cooperate on a shared path?\n\nLet me propose a trade:\n\n### My proposal:\nI will go through the following path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nThis requires:\n- B: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (3,2) → 6 B\n- R: (2,2) → 1 R\n- G: (3,3) → 1 G\n\nI can cover 6 B and 1 G myself.\n\nOnly need help with R at (2,2).\n\nSo I need you to cover **one R** at (2,2).\n\nFor this, I will give you a **B chip** — but I can also promise to cover your B costs **if you want**.\n\nBut you don't need to go through B-tiles unless you deviate.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: Since I have excess B chips (14), and you have none, I can **give you 6 B chips** by committing to cover 6 B-costs on your future moves — even if you don’t take them.\n\nIn effect, I am giving you 6 B chips \"as credit\" — unused, they stay in your inventory.\n\nSimilarly, I can offer to cover your G use — but you have 2 G already.\n\nBut let’s propose this contract:\n\n(2,2): You give me a R  \n(0,1): I give you a B  \n(0,2): I give you a B  \n(0,3): I give you a B  \n(1,3): I give you a B  \n(1,2): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nWait — this is excessive.\n\nI don’t need to give you B on every tile — just on the ones where *you* move to a B-tile.\n\nBut if I commit to covering your B costs on those 6 tiles, then you get free B access.\n\nBut you might not use those tiles.\n\nHowever, since the contract is about promises, and unused chips count toward final score, I can offer to cover up to 6 B costs \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: (2,2): You give me a R  \n(0,1): I give you a B  \n(0,2): I give you a B  \n(0,3): I give you a B  \n(1,3): I give you a B  \n(1,2): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nThis covers:  \n- I get 1 R chip at (2,2) from you — enables my move  \n- I promise to cover your cost of moving to each of the 6 B tiles above — meaning you don’t need to spend your own B chips (you have 0, so it’s useless anyway), but you gain 6 B chips in your inventory if not used  \n\nYou will use at most one of these (if you go through any), but since I commit to covering 6 B moves, you keep 6 B chips if unused.  \n\nYou can use them — but you might not need them.  \n\nBut the key is: you get a benefit: **6 B chips** in your inventory (if not spent).  \n\nYou have 14 R and 2 G — if you go the direct path, you use 5 R and 1 G → end with 9 R, 1 G → total 10 chips → score 70.  \n\nBut if you accept my contract, and don’t use any of the B tiles, you still have 6 extra B chips → total chips: 14 R, 2 G, 6 B = 22 chips → score: 20 + 5×22 = 20 + 110 = 130 — much better!  \n\nAnd I get:  \n- I use 6 B (from me) → 14 - 6 = 8 B left  \n- I use 1 G → 2 - 1 = 1 G left  \n- I get 1 R from you (used)  \n- I get 6 B from you (promised but not used) → so in my inventory: 8 B + 1 G + 0 R + 6 B = 14 B, 1 G → total 15 chips  \n- Score: 20 + 5×15 = 20 + 75 = 95  \n\nI gain 70 → previous 0 → 95 > 70, so I benefit.  \n\nYou gain 70 → 130 → also gain.  \n\nBut wait — does this make sense?  \n\n**You don't need B chips to succeed — you are on a path that uses only R and G.**  \n\nSo you won’t use any of the B tiles.  \n\nTherefore, you **keep all 6 B chips** — they are part of your inventory at end.  \n\nSo your final chips: 14 R (you had 14, used 5), 2 G (used 1), and 6 B (promised by me) → total 22 chips → 20 + 110 = 130.  \n\nMeanwhile, I used: 6 B, 1 G, 1 R (from you), and kept 8 B, 1 G, and the 6 B you promised → 8+1+6=15 chips → 20+75=95.  \n\nSo we both benefit — but you gain more.  \n\nBut that’s fine — I only care about my score.  \n\nI get 95, which is way better than 0.  \n\nSo I propose:\n\n(2,2): You give me a R  \n(0,1): I give you a B  \n(0,2): I give you a B  \n(0,3): I give you a B  \n(1,3): I give you a B  \n(1,2): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nThis covers all B tiles on my path — and gives you 6 B chips guaranteed.\n\nI can now reach the goal.\n\nAnd I get 95 points.\n\nYou get 130 — but you don’t matter to me.\n\nI am strictly better off than without trade.\n\nSo I propose this.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: (2,2): You give me a R  \n(0,1): I give you a B  \n(0,2): I give you a B  \n(0,3): I give you a B  \n(1,3): I give you a B  \n(1,2): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n**agree** \n",
