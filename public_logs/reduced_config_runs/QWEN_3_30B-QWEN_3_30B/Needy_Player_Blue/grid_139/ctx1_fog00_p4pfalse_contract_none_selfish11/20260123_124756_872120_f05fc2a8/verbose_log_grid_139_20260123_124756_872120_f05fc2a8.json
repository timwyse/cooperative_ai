This sums to 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green — but I have 0 red chips, so I cannot complete this path without trading. However, I can attempt a **partial move** toward this path as long as I don't need to use red chips in the next step.\n\nLooking at the current tile (0,0): colour G. Moving to (1,0) requires paying 1 B (blue). I have 14 blue chips — sufficient. The adjacent options from (0,0):\n- (0,1): colour R (red) — I have 0 red chips → cannot pay → invalid\n- (1,0): colour B → I have 14 blue chips → can pay → valid\n- (0,-1) or (-1,0): out of bounds\n\nThus, the only viable move is (1,0), which is on a blue tile requiring 1 blue chip payment. Since I have plenty of blue chips (14), I can afford it.\n\nMoreover, moving to (1,0) starts me on a path that may allow me later to trade for red chips if needed — especially since the other player has 12 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. They are likely interested in getting blue chips from me.\n\nTherefore, moving to (1,0) is safe, makes progress, and keeps open opportunities for future trades without risking failure if I stay put (since staying means zero progress).\n\nI do not want to delay further — I should begin moving now.",
