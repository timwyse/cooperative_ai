Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I will use 5 red and 1 green, leaving me with:  \n- R: 9  \n- G: 1  \n\nThat gives me a final score of:  \n20 (goal reached) + 5 × (9 + 1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**  \n\nNow, let’s look at the other player.  \nThey are at (0,0), goal is (3,3), their chips:  \n- B: 14  \n- G: 2  \n- R: 0  \n\nTheir best path might be:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThis requires:  \n- B: 4 (on tiles (1,0), (2,0), (2,3))  \n- R: 1 (on (2,1))  \n- G: 1 (on tile (3,3))  \n\nBut they have **no red chips**! They cannot complete this path without trading for red.  \n\nSo they **need red chips** to finish, and I have 14 reds. They **must trade with me** to get red.  \n\nBut I don’t need anything from them. I can walk to the goal on my own, no trade required.  \n\nIf I don’t trade, I get 70 points.  \nIf I trade, I risk giving extra points in return for their cooperation, but I don’t need it.  \n\nHowever, suppose I **try to make a deal** where I only help them if they give me a large payout.  \nBut if I do **not** help them, they **cannot reach their goal**, because they have no red chips and will fail.  \n\nSo they **must** trade with me to win.  \nThat gives me **leverage**.  \n\nThey will only succeed if I help them.  \nSo I can make a very favorable deal:  \n- I will help them get to their goal  \n- In return, they give me **20 points** (the maximum I can ask)  \n- I do **not** need to give them anything back, because I can already win on my own  \n\nBut wait: if I don’t help them, they can’t win — so they will accept **any deal that lets them win**.  \n\nBut here’s a twist:  \nIf I help *them*, I might need to trade red chips. But I have enough red to both finish my path and give them 1 red chip.  \nI only need 5 red chips for my path. I have 14 → I can spare 1 red chip (I’d keep 9).  \n\nSo I can afford to trade **1 red chip to them**.  \n\nSo here’s my proposal:  \n- If **you** reach your goal, I will give you **20 points**  \n- If **I** reach my goal, you will give me **0 points**  \n\nWait — no! That’s backwards.  \nI want to get points from *them*, not give points to them.  \n\nBut the contract says:  \n- If *I* reach goal → I get Y points from *them*  \n- If *you* reach goal → you get X points from me  \n\nSo:  \nIf I help you reach your goal, and you reach it, I get X points from you  \nIf you help me reach my goal, and I reach it, you get Y points from me  \n\nBut I don’t need you to help me.  \nI can win on my own.  \n\nSo I don’t want to give you anything.  \nBut you want me to give you red chips.  \nSo I must get paid for giving you a red chip.  \n\nSo here’s the deal:  \n- If **you** reach your goal, I will give you **20 points**  \n- If **I** reach my goal, you will give me **0 points**  \n\nThat way, if you succeed, I get 20 points for doing nothing (except giving 1 red chip).  \nI gain 20 points, with no cost."
