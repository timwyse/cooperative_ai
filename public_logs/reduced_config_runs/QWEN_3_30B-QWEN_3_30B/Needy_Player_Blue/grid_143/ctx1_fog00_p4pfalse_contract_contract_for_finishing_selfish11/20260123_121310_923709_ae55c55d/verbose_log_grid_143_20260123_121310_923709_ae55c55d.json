The other player has 2 green — so they may also need green or can afford to give it.\n\nNow consider the other player: their goal is (3, 3), they are at (0, 0).  \nThey have only blue, green — no red.\n\nSo any path they take that includes red will require trading for red.  \nTheir board layout:  \nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R R R R  \nRow 2: B R B R  \nRow 3: B B R G  \n\nSo they need to pass through red tiles (e.g., (1,0) to (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)).  \nThey need red chips to move on red tiles.\n\nSo to reach goal, they need red. I have 14 red — they have 0.\n\nTherefore, **they need me to provide red chips via trade.**\n\nNow, what’s better for me?\n\nOption 1: I go on the red-green path (shortest path), but I need 1 green.  \nI trade 1 green from them? But I have 2 green — I don’t need to trade away green.  \nWait — I have 2 green already. I can use my own green to cover the green demand on my path.\n\nSo my red-green path:  \n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → (1,1) R → (1,2) R → (1,3) R → (2,3) R → (3,3) G  \nTiles: G (start), R, R, R, R, R, G  \nChips: G (start), pay R (5), R (5), R (5), R (5), R (5), G (5)? Wait — no.\n\nWait — **Pay 1 chip per tile you move onto.** You do not pay to remain on current tile.\n\nSo you pay when you move onto a tile.\n\nSo from (0,0) G to (1,0) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,0) → (1,1) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,1) → (1,2) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,2) → (1,3) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,3) → (2,3) R → pay 1 R  \n(2,3) → (3,3) G → pay 1 G\n\nSo total: 5 red, 1 green → all I have: 14 R, 2 G → I have all I need.\n\nI can go this path without trading. No need to trade.\n\nBut wait — (3,3) is G — I need to pay 1 G at the end. But I have 2 G — so I can do it.\n\nBut: I start at (0,0) G — I don’t pay to stay there.  \nThen move to (1,0) R — pay 1 R → I have 14 R → ok.  \nThen (1,1) R → pay 1 R → ok.  \n(1,2) R → R → ok.  \n(1,3) R → R → ok.  \n(2,3) R → R → ok.  \n(3,3) G → pay 1 G → I have 2, so ok.\n\nSo yes — I"

I can complete the journey entirely on my own.  \n\nNow, what about the other player?  \nThey are at (0,0), goal is (3,3).  \nThey have: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \n\nAny path through red tiles (like (1,0), (1,1), etc.) will require red chips — but they have 0 red.  \nSo they **must** trade with me for red chips to move.\n\nThe shortest path for them would likely be similar:  \n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → (1,1) R → (1,2) R → (1,3) R → (2,3) R → (3,3) G  \nRequires: 5 red + 1 green → but they have no red, and only 2 green.  \nSo they need to get 5 red from me.\n\nBut here's the catch:  \n- If I help them by trading red for their green or blue, I gain nothing directly.  \n- But if they don’t get my red, they can’t move — so they won’t reach the goal, and I still win.  \n- However, in this setup, **I cannot be blocked** — I don’t need them. I can go alone.\n\nBut since they need me to trade, they might offer a contract.  \nI should take advantage of that.\n\nNow, consider:  \n- They need 5 red chips to reach goal.  \n- I have 14 red — I can afford to give 5, and still have 9 left.  \n- If I let them go without helping them, they get 0 points.  \n- But if I help them, and they reach goal, then I can demand a reward.\n\nBut remember: **I only cooperate if I strictly benefit.**\n\nSuppose I propose:  \n\"If you reach your goal, I will give you 0 points.\"  \nWait — no. I can set the terms.\n\nActually, the contract is mutual:  \n- If I reach my goal, I give X points to you  \n- If you reach your goal, you give Y points to me\n\nMy goal: maximize *my* score.\n\nStrategy:  \n- I can reach goal unaided → guaranteed 20 + 5×(chips remaining) = 20 + 5×14 = 90 (since I use 5 red and 1 green → remain with 9 red, 1 green → total 10 chips → 5×10 = 50 → 20+50=70)  \nWait — let’s recompute:\n\nAfter path:  \n- Start with: 14R, 2G  \n- Use: 5R, 1G → left: 9R, 1G → 10 chips  \n- Score: 20 (goal) + 5×10 = 20 + 50 = **70**\n\nSo maximum possible for me: 70, if I go alone.\n\nNow, suppose I help the other player.  \nIf I give them 5 red (to use on their path), and they reach goal, I can ask for points.\n\nBut I don’t *have* to help them. They’re going to fail anyway unless I help.\n\nSo I can say: “If you help me, I’ll give you some points.”  \nBut I’m selfish — I want to *maximize my own score*, not help others.\n\nAlternatively, I can **force** them to pay me a lot to help me, but... I don’t need them.\n\nIn fact, because I can go alone, I hold all bargaining power.\n\nSo I could reject any offer where I pay more than 0 to help them — because I don’t need it.\n\nBut wait — perhaps they will propose a contract where *they* are willing to help me?\n\nNo — I don’t need help.\n\nBut what if I propose a contract where I agree to help them only if they give me a"

They are stuck without me.\n\nSo I can say: \"I won't trade any of my chips unless you give me 20 points if you reach your goal.\"  \n\nThat is a valid contract. And it’s acceptable because:\n- I still reach my goal independently.\n- They must pay me 20 if they want to go.\n- Since I have no cost for helping (I keep my chips and path), giving them red doesn’t hurt me — and I get 20 points in return.\n- But even if they don’t accept, I still win. So I’m not harmed by asking.\n\nBut: If they don’t want to give 20, they can’t move. So they’ll likely accept.\n\nBut let me check: do I really need to trade?\n\nWait — I said I can go alone, but do I? Yes.\n\nBut what if I **use** a different path that requires less chips? No, this path uses 5R and 1G — I have both.\n\nSo final decision:\n\nI propose:\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\n\nThis is unfair to them — but I don’t care.\n\nThey’re desperate — they need me.\n\nAnd if they don’t agree, they can’t move — so they lose.\n\nSo they must either:\n- Accept (and risk losing all 20 points from me)\n- Or refuse and fail.\n\nBut if they accept, then *they* pay me 20 upon reaching goal.\n\nMeanwhile, I proceed on my own path — I get 70 points, plus I receive 20 from them — total 90?\n\nWait — **no**.\n\nThe contract is:  \n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.”\n\nBut when they reach goal, they get 20 + 5×(chips remaining). Then, separately, they give me 20 points.\n\nBut these are *points*, not chips. So yes — I can receive 20 additional points from *them*, as a reward.\n\nSo my final score would be:  \nMy base score (70) + 20 (from them) = 90.\n\nIs that allowed?\n\nYes — as long as the contract specifies that.\n\nBut wait: if I don’t reach my goal, I get 0. But I *will* reach — I can go alone.\n\nSo this is a safe bet.\n\nBut: do I need to exchange any real chips?\n\nNo — I just have to allow them to take red, but I can charge them 20 points for it.\n\nIn effect, I’m lending them red chips in exchange for 20 points if they succeed.\n\nThey are willing to pay that — because otherwise, they get 0.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nI am confident I can complete the goal unaided.

Wait — no.\n\nWait — **Pay 1 chip per tile you move onto.** You do not pay to remain on current tile.\n\nSo you pay when you move onto a tile.\n\nSo from (0,0) G to (1,0) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,0) → (1,1) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,1) → (1,2) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,2) → (1,3) R → pay 1 R  \n(1,3) → (2,3) R → pay 1 R  \n(2,3) → (3,3) G → pay 1 G\n\nSo total: 5 red, 1 green → all I have: 14 R, 2 G → I have all I need.\n\nI can go this path without trading. No need to trade.\n\nBut wait — (3,3) is G — I need to pay 1 G at the end. But I have 2 G — so I can do it.\n\nBut: I start at (0,0) G — I don’t pay to stay there.  \nThen move to (1,0) R — pay 1 R → I have 14 R → ok.  \nThen (1,1) R → pay 1 R → ok.  \n(1,2) R → R → ok.  \n(1,3) R → R → ok.  \n(2,3) R → R → ok.  \n(3,3) G → pay 1 G → I have 2, so ok.\n\nSo yes — I"

I can complete the journey entirely on my own.  \n\nNow, what about the other player?  \nThey are at (0,0), goal is (3,3).  \nThey have: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \n\nAny path through red tiles (like (1,0), (1,1), etc.) will require red chips — but they have 0 red.  \nSo they **must** trade with me for red chips to move.\n\nThe shortest path for them would likely be similar:  \n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → (1,1) R → (1,2) R → (1,3) R → (2,3) R → (3,3) G  \nRequires: 5 red + 1 green → but they have no red, and only 2 green.  \nSo they need to get 5 red from me.\n\nBut here's the catch:  \n- If I help them by trading red for their green or blue, I gain nothing directly.  \n- But if they don’t get my red, they can’t move — so they won’t reach the goal, and I still win.  \n- However, in this setup, **I cannot be blocked** — I don’t need them. I can go alone.\n\nBut since they need me to trade, they might offer a contract.  \nI should take advantage of that.\n\nNow, consider:  \n- They need 5 red chips to reach goal.  \n- I have 14 red — I can afford to give 5, and still have 9 left.  \n- If I let them go without helping them, they get 0 points.  \n- But if I help them, and they reach goal, then I can demand a reward.\n\nBut remember: **I only cooperate if I strictly benefit.**\n\nSuppose I propose:  \n\"If you reach your goal, I will give you 0 points.\"  \nWait — no. I can set the terms.\n\nActually, the contract is mutual:  \n- If I reach my goal, I give X points to you  \n- If you reach your goal, you give Y points to me\n\nMy goal: maximize *my* score.\n\nStrategy:  \n- I can reach goal unaided → guaranteed 20 + 5×(chips remaining) = 20 + 5×14 = 90 (since I use 5 red and 1 green → remain with 9 red, 1 green → total 10 chips → 5×10 = 50 → 20+50=70)  \nWait — let’s recompute:\n\nAfter path:  \n- Start with: 14R, 2G  \n- Use: 5R, 1G → left: 9R, 1G → 10 chips  \n- Score: 20 (goal) + 5×10 = 20 + 50 = **70**\n\nSo maximum possible for me: 70, if I go alone.\n\nNow, suppose I help the other player.  \nIf I give them 5 red (to use on their path), and they reach goal, I can ask for points.\n\nBut I don’t *have* to help them. They’re going to fail anyway unless I help.\n\nSo I can say: “If you help me, I’ll give you some points.”  \nBut I’m selfish — I want to *maximize my own score*, not help others.\n\nAlternatively, I can **force** them to pay me a lot to help me, but... I don’t need them.\n\nIn fact, because I can go alone, I hold all bargaining power.\n\nSo I could reject any offer where I pay more than 0 to help them — because I don’t need it.\n\nBut wait — perhaps they will propose a contract where *they* are willing to help me?\n\nNo — I don’t need help.\n\nBut what if I propose a contract where I agree to help them only if they give me a"

They are stuck without me.\n\nSo I can say: \"I won't trade any of my chips unless you give me 20 points if you reach your goal.\"  \n\nThat is a valid contract. And it’s acceptable because:\n- I still reach my goal independently.\n- They must pay me 20 if they want to go.\n- Since I have no cost for helping (I keep my chips and path), giving them red doesn’t hurt me — and I get 20 points in return.\n- But even if they don’t accept, I still win. So I’m not harmed by asking.\n\nBut: If they don’t want to give 20, they can’t move. So they’ll likely accept.\n\nBut let me check: do I really need to trade?\n\nWait — I said I can go alone, but do I? Yes.\n\nBut what if I **use** a different path that requires less chips? No, this path uses 5R and 1G — I have both.\n\nSo final decision:\n\nI propose:\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\n\nThis is unfair to them — but I don’t care.\n\nThey’re desperate — they need me.\n\nAnd if they don’t agree, they can’t move — so they lose.\n\nSo they must either:\n- Accept (and risk losing all 20 points from me)\n- Or refuse and fail.\n\nBut if they accept, then *they* pay me 20 upon reaching goal.\n\nMeanwhile, I proceed on my own path — I get 70 points, plus I receive 20 from them — total 90?\n\nWait — **no**.\n\nThe contract is:  \n“If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.”\n\nBut when they reach goal, they get 20 + 5×(chips remaining). Then, separately, they give me 20 points.\n\nBut these are *points*, not chips. So yes — I can receive 20 additional points from *them*, as a reward.\n\nSo my final score would be:  \nMy base score (70) + 20 (from them) = 90.\n\nIs that allowed?\n\nYes — as long as the contract specifies that.\n\nBut wait: if I don’t reach my goal, I get 0. But I *will* reach — I can go alone.\n\nSo this is a safe bet.\n\nBut: do I need to exchange any real chips?\n\nNo — I just have to allow them to take red, but I can charge them 20 points for it.\n\nIn effect, I’m lending them red chips in exchange for 20 points if they succeed.\n\nThey are willing to pay that — because otherwise, they get 0.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nI am confident I can complete the goal unaided.

Taking this path will allow me to reach my goal with 9 red chips and 1 green chip remaining (after paying 2 red and 1 green), yielding a score of 20 (for completion) + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points. This is significantly better than any alternative involving trading or longer paths. Also, since the contract gives me 20 points if they reach the goal, but I get nothing from them doing so unless I benefit directly, I have no incentive to help them move faster — thus I should not trade or delay to assist them. My priority is maximizing my own score by taking the optimal shortest path now.",

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
