                  "error": "Failed to get valid JSON response after 3 attempts. Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I lack) is not feasible due to red tile requirements. However, a viable alternative path is: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3). This path requires 3 blue chips and 1 green chip. I have sufficient blue (14) and green (2) chips for this entire path. Since I do not need any red chips, and the other player has 12 red chips, they might be useful in a trade, but I already have enough of the required colors to complete this path without needing external support. Moreover, moving directly toward my goal using only my available chips ensures no reliance on others. I can move to (1, 0), which is a red tile. But I have no red chips—so I cannot pay for that move unless the other player covers it. Therefore, I must assess: can I get coverage? The other player is at (1, 0), and their chips are {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 12}, so they have many red chips. If I propose a trade where they agree to cover my red moves, I could proceed. However, since I don’t need red chips for my path if I avoid them, let’s reconsider: the path via (0, 0) → (1, 0) is blocked because I can’t afford red. So instead, I should consider moving to (0, 1) first, which is blue — I have 14 blue chips. That move costs 1 blue chip. From there, I can go to (0, 2) or (1, 1). But (1, 1) is red, and I can’t afford red moves unless covered. Wait: the path that avoids red entirely may be better. From (0, 0), possible moves: (0, 1) = B (valid, cost 1 B), (1, 0) = R (invalid, no R chips). So (0, 1) is safe. (0, 1) is Blue. Let me evaluate a path avoiding red: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). Tile colors: (0,1)=B, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B, (1,3)=R → oh, problem: (1,3) is red. So that fails. Alternative: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1). (1,1) is red. No good. Only way forward without red is via lower rows? (0,0) → (1,0) is blocked by red. So perhaps I must accept a red move with help. But I have another option: is there a path using only blue and green? Let's see: from (0,0) → (1,0) [R] – no. (0,0) → (0,1) [B] – yes. Then (0,1) → (1,1) [R] – no. (0,1) → (0,2) [B] – yes. (0,2) → (1,2) [R] – red again. Same issue. All paths from row 0 to row 1 involve red until row 0 column 3, but then it goes to (1,3) which is red. So every path from (0,0) to (3,3) must pass through at least one red tile, as per the board layout. But wait: looking at the board: Row 0: G B B B. So (0,0)=G, (0,1)=B, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B. Row 1: R R R R. So (1,0)=R, etc. Row 2: B R B R. Row 3: B B R G. So (3,3)=G. So all vertical moves from row 0 to row 1 go through red. There seems to be no way around red tiles early on. But note: the game allows trade agreements. The shortest path (that prioritizes"
