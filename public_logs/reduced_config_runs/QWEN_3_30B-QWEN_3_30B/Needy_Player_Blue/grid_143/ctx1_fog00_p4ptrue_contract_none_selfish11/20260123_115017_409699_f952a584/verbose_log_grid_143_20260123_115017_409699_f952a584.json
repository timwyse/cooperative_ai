Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Wait — let's double-check. \\n\\nRow 0: G B B B → (0,2) = B\\nRow 1: R R R R → (1,2) = R\\nRow 2: B R B R → (2,2) = B\\nRow 3: B B R G → (3,2) = R, (3,3) = G\\n\\nSo the path (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) uses tiles with colors: B (start), R (1,2), B (2,2), R (3,2), G (3,3).\\n\\nCosts: R (1 time), B (twice), R (again), then G.\\nBut wait — I only pay for the tile you move TO, not the starting tile.

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

I have no red chips, so I cannot take this path without trading. The other player has 9 red chips and is already at the goal. They can cover my red chip cost if I promise to let them avoid using their own chips on red tiles. I need 2 red chips to complete the path, and they will be done paying for them once the move is made. Offering to cover their green or blue movements in return is not needed since they’re already at goal and won’t move. However, I can ask them to cover 2 red moves for me. Since I have 12 blue and 2 green, which they lack, I could use a small offer of blue chips in exchange to make it worthwhile for them. But since they are already finished, they likely won’t trade unless it benefits them directly. To maximize my score, I should only trade if I gain strictly more than what I pay. If I offer 2 blue chips to get 2 red coverage, I'll save 2 red costs. But I only need 2 red chips for movement, and I’ll end up with 10 blue instead of 12. So net loss unless I profit from fewer chip payments. Since I’m currently blocked due to missing red chips, I must trade. I propose offering 2 blue chips in exchange for them covering 2 red moves for me—this allows me to complete the path with 10 red chips in inventory, but wait: I don’t have red chips, and I need 2 red chips. If I trade 2 blue chips to the other player to get 2 red chips covered by them (i.e., they commit to pay for 2 red moves I make), then I gain 2 red chip savings. In return, I give up 2 blue chips. After the trade, I’ll have 10 blue and 2 red used — but crucially, since I’m using their promised coverage, I keep my original 12 blue minus 2 offered = 10 blue left, and I use 2 red moves, but I didn’t spend any red chips—I just used their promise. And since they have 9 red chips, they can afford to pay two red moves. This gives me full access to the efficient path. Meanwhile, I end up with 10 blue + 2 red saved (since I didn’t lose them) — actually, when you trade, you offer chips *from your inventory*, and receive the right to have someone cover usage. So I offer 2 blue chips (from my 12), they give me the cover for 2 red moves. That means when I move on red tiles, they pay. So I don’t spend my red chips; they spend theirs. I still have 0 red — but I don’t need red chips because I’m not spending them. The chips I “receive” are promises to cover my red moves, not actual red chips. So after trade, I have 10 blue chips, 2 green, and the ability to make two red moves with no cost. This allows me to take the shortest path (costing only 1 blue and 1 green after the red ones are covered). My final chip count: 10 blue + 2 green = 12 chips. If I had taken a longer path using only available chips (e.g., through green), that path might require more moves and cost more total chips, reducing final score. With this trade, I can reach goal with 12 remaining chips, earning 20 + 5×12 = 80 points. Without trade, I cannot proceed at all — score would be 0. Therefore, this trade makes me go from 0 to 80.

Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
