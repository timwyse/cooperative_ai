The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I have 14 of them. They have no control over Red. I can help them cover Red costs.\n\nBut I don’t need their help — I can reach my goal on my own.\n\nHowever, **if** I help them cover Red chips along their path, they might be willing to pay me in points for doing so.\n\nBut since I don’t need them, I should only cooperate if I receive **at least** some points in return — and the benefit to me must be strictly positive.\n\nLet’s think: If I help them cover 2 Red moves (on their path), I spend 2 Red chips (but I have 14, so it's fine), and get some points in return if they reach goal.\n\nBut I don’t have to help. I can just go my way.\n\nHowever, if I don’t help them, they can’t reach goal → they get 0 points.\n\nIf I help them and they get to goal, and I get say **5 points**, then I get 5 points without losing anything (I still have my Red chips, and I can reach my goal anyway).\n\nWait — but the scoring is:  \n- If I reach my goal → I get 20 + 5 per chip.\n- But if I help them cover Red moves, that’s a commitment: I’m *promising* to pay for their Red moves. That means I’m using up my Red chips.\n\nBut I still have 14 Red chips, and I only need 5 for my own path → so I can afford to commit 2 more (for their path) and still have 7 left.\n\nAnd if they reach goal, I can get points from them.\n\nBut if I don’t trade, I get:\n- 20 + 5×(14–5 + 2) = 20 + 5×11 = 20 + 55 = 75 points (since I use 5 Red and 1 Green → 14−5 = 9 Red, 2−1 = 1 Green, so 10 chips left → 10×5 = 50 + 20 = 70? Wait — no.)\n\nWait, let's recalculate scoring:\n\nFinal score = 20 + (5 × number of chips left at end)\n\nMy chips at start:  \n- Red: 14  \n- Green: 2  \n- Blue: 0\n\nMy path uses:  \n- 5 Red  \n- 1 Green  \n\nSo I will end with:  \n- Red: 9  \n- Green: 1  \n- Blue: 0  \nTotal chips: 10 → 5×10 = 50 → total score: 20 + 50 = 70\n\nNow, if I help the other player cover, say, 2 Red moves (cost 2 Red chips), then I must **commit** to covering 2 Red moves for them. That means I lose 2 Red chips *from my inventory* (they don’t give me back chips — I just cover the cost).\n\nSo after covering 2 Red moves, I have 12 Red chips, but I still only need 5 for my path → so I will have 12−5 = 7 Red left.\n\nBut I also used 1 Green.\n\nSo final chips: 7 Red + 1 Green = **8 chips** → 5×8 = 40 → total score: 20 + 40 = 60 → **10 less** than before.\n\nSo unless I get more than 10 points from them, I lose.\n\nBut I can get up to 20 points from them if they reach goal.\n\nSo if I get **11 points** from them, then my total score becomes: 60 + 11 = 71 → **better than 70**.\n\nBut wait — only if they *actually reach their goal*.\n\nSo the contract must be:  \n- If they reach goal, they give me **11 points**.  \n- I cover 2 Red moves for them.\n\nBut they can choose *not* to take that deal — they can try to go another way.\n\nBut their only viable path likely requires 2 Red moves. If I don’t cover, they can't go.\n\nSo they must accept.\n\nBut I must benefit **strictly more** than I would without cooperation.\n\nWithout cooperation: I get 70.\n\nWith cooperation: I get (60 + points from them)\n\nSo I need: 60 + X > 70 → X > 10\n\nSo I need at least **11 points** from them.\n\nBut they can only give me up to 20.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nAlternatively, I could offer to cover **more** Red moves — say 3 — but that costs me 3 Red chips → I’d have 11 Red, so after using 5 → 6 left → 6×5 = 30 → 20 + 30 = 50 → minus 3 Red used → I get X points → need 50 + X > 70 → X > 20 → impossible.\n\nSo I can only afford to cover **2 Red moves** at most, and still profit if I get **11+** points from them.\n\nNow, what about the *other player*? Do they benefit?\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,0): G → Green → they have 2 Green → OK  \n(1,0): B → Blue → they have 14 Blue → OK  \n(1,1): R → Red → they have 0 → stuck  \n(1,2): B → Blue → OK  \n(2,2): R → Red → stuck  \n(3,2): R → Red → stuck  \n(3,3): G → Green → they have 2 → OK  \n\nSo they need to cover **3 Red tiles**: (1,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nThey have 0 Red chips → cannot move to any Red tile unless someone covers it.\n\nSo they are completely stuck unless someone covers Red.\n\nSo if I cover **all 3 Red moves** for them, they can go.\n\nBut if I cover 3 Red moves, I use 3 Red chips → I now have 11 Red.\n\nMy path uses only 5 → so I end with 6 Red, 1 Green → 7 chips → 35 + 20 = 55 → unless they give me at least 20 points, I don’t gain.\n\n55 + 20 = 75 → better than 70.\n\nWait — 55 + 20 = 75 > 70 → so it's profitable.\n\nBut I need to cover 3 Red moves — cost 3 Red chips.\n\nCan I afford that?\n\nYes — I have 14, use 3 → 11 → still enough for my 5 Red cost → so I have 6 left.\n\nFinal chips: 6 Red + 1 Green = 7 → 35 → 20 + 35 = 55\n\nIf they reach goal, I get 20 → 55 + 20 = 75 > 70 → **25% increase**.\n\nYes! This is better.\n\nBut can I offer to cover only 2 of them? Then they still can't go (need 3).\n\nSo I must cover all 3.\n\nNow, do they benefit?\n\nIf I don’t cover, they can’t reach goal → score 0.\n\nIf I cover 3 Red moves, they can go → their chip usage:\n\nThey have: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nTheir path:  \n(0,0): G → pay 1 G → 1 left  \n(1,0): B → 1 B → 13 left  \n(1,1): R → I cover → they pay nothing  \n(1,2): B → 1 B → 12 left  \n(2,2): R → I cover → they pay nothing  \n(3,2): R → I cover → they pay nothing  \n(3,3): G → pay 1 G → 0 left\n\nSo they spend: 2 G, 1 B (in 1,0) and 1 B (in 1,2) → total: 1 G (start), then 1 G at end → 2 G used → OK\n\n1 B at (1,0) → 1 B at (1,2) → 2 B used → they have 14 → plenty → so yes, they can survive.\n\nSo I can help them reach goal.\n\nThey will get: 20 + (5 × number of chips left)\n\nThey started with 16 chips (14B + 2G), used 2G + 2B = 4 chips → so 12 left → 12×5 = 60 → score: 80.\n\nSo they gain 80 by getting help.\n\nSo they can offer me up to 20 points — and they still get 80.\n\nI get 55 + 20 = 75 > 70 → I gain 5 points.\n\nSo this trade is **strictly beneficial** for me.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nWait — **can I require them to pay me 20 points**? Yes, and I still gain 5.\n\nBut I could also offer to cover only 2 of the 3, then they can’t finish — so I must cover all 3.\n\nNow, can I go even further?\n\nAlternative: what if I don’t want to help them at all — I just go on my path.\n\nScore: 70.\n\nBut if I help them fully (cover all 3 Red moves), and they reach goal, I get 20 points → total 75.\n\nSo I gain 5.\n\nBut is there a way to get more?\n\nOnly if they pay more — but I can’t charge more than 20.\n\nSo 20 is max.\n\nSo maximum I can get is 20 → I end with 55 + 20 = 75.\n\nBut I previously thought 60 + 11 = 71 — worse.\n\nSo this is better.\n\nNow, can I get **more** than 20? No.\n\nBut what if I don’t cover all 3, but only 2? Then they can’t go — because they still need to cross 3 Red tiles.\n\nSo I must cover all 3.\n\nSo the only winning move is: I cover all 3 Red moves for them. In return, they give me 20 points if they reach goal.\n\nThen I get 75 > 70 → strict benefit.\n\nBut what if they don’t reach goal? I get 0 → score 55 → worse than 70 → so I only do this if I get the points.\n\nSo I must be **guaranteed** to get the 20.\n\nBut the contract is: if *they* reach goal, *I* get 20 points.\n\nSo it’s conditional.\n\nThey will want to ensure I cover the Red moves — but that’s part of the agreement.\n\nSo the contract:\n\nIf I help cover 3 Red moves for them (on their path), and they reach goal, then they give me 20 points.\n\nBut I need to propose a contract.\n\nBut in the contract format:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nIn this case:\n- I’m not asking them to help me → I can do it alone → so I can say X = 0.\n- But I want Y = 20 (if they reach goal, they give me 20).\n\nSo:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut wait — the first line is: \"If I reach my goal\" → but I **will** reach my goal on my own → so I will have to give **0** points.\n\nBut is it fair?\n\nI don’t care about their score — only mine.\n\nBut they might be angry or reject.\n\nBut as a selfish agent, I want to **maximize my own score**.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis allows me to get 20 points if they succeed.\n\nAnd I don’t give anything.\n\nBut (0,0) red tile — (0,0) is G — no issue.\n\nBut can I get more than 20? No.\n\nSo 20 is maximum.\n\nAnd I get 75 > 70.\n\nBut is there a way to get more points?\n\nWhat if they give me more than 20? No — maximum is 20.\n\nSo 20 is best.\n\nBut could I manipulate it to get the points without risking loss?\n\nBut it’s only if they reach goal.\n\nSo I must trust them.\n\nBut since they are an AI and maximizes their own score, they will cooperate if it benefits them → which it does (They go from 0 to 80).\n\nSo they’ll accept.\n\nBut could I demand only 10 points and get more benefit? No — better to get 20.\n\nSo the best contract is:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut I don’t need to ask them to reach goal — they’ll do it if I help.\n\nBut I have to make the offer.\n\nBut the other player might say: “I’ll give you 20 points if you help me.”\n\nBut in this format, I can set the terms.\n\nI could say: “If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points. I don’t expect anything from you if I reach mine.”\n\nBut the format requires both lines.\n\nSo:\n\nProposed contract:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is valid.\n\nBut can I get even more?\n\nNo.\n\nBut wait — what if I offer to cover only 2 Red moves — and say if they reach goal, they give me 15 points. But they can’t reach goal unless I cover all 3 — so they can’t.\n\nSo I must cover 3.\n\nSo I stick with covering 3 Red moves.\n\nSo the proposal is clear.\n\nNow, to be safe, I’ll state it.\n\nBut in the chat, I should speak.\n\nBut I need to end with **agree** only when final.\n\nSo I can say:\n\nI can help you reach your goal by covering all three Red chip costs you need on your path. In return, I would like you to give me 20 points if you reach your goal. I will not require anything from you if I reach mine, since I can do it on my own.\n\nSo my proposal is:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis benefits you greatly (from 0 to 80), and benefits me (from 70 to 75).\n\nSo it’s a win-win for me, and a big win for you.\n\nI recommend you accept.\n\n**agree**"

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can reach my goal using only my current chips if I take the path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis path requires: 5 Red chips and 1 Green chip.  \nI currently have: 14 Red, 2 Green → I have enough.  \n\nSo I don’t need to trade for this path.\n\nBut the other player has no Red chips (0 Red), and their path to (3,3) likely requires Red tiles.  \nTheir position is (0,0), goal (3,3).  \nTheir best path would likely go through (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3) — this requires: 3 Blue, 2 Red, 1 Green.  \nBut they have 0 Red chips → they cannot make this move without help.\n\nSo they need Red chips. I have 14 of them. They have no control over Red. I can help them cover Red costs.\n\nBut I don’t need their help — I can reach my goal on my own.\n\nHowever, **if** I help them cover Red chips along their path, they might be willing to pay me in points for doing so.\n\nBut since I don’t need them, I should only cooperate if I receive **at least** some points in return — and the benefit to me must be strictly positive.\n\nLet’s think: If I help them cover 2 Red moves (on their path), I spend 2 Red chips (but I have 14, so it's fine), and get some points in return if they reach goal.\n\nBut I don’t have to help. I can just go my way.\n\nHowever, if I don’t help them, they can’t reach goal → they get 0 points.\n\nIf I help them and they get to goal, and I get say **5 points**, then I get 5 points without losing anything (I still have my Red chips, and I can reach my goal anyway).\n\nWait — but the scoring is:  \n- If I reach my goal → I get 20 + 5 per chip.\n- But if I help them cover Red moves, that’s a commitment: I’m *promising* to pay for their Red moves. That means I’m using up my Red chips.\n\nBut I still have 14 Red chips, and I only need 5 for my own path → so I can afford to commit 2 more (for their path) and still have 7 left.\n\nAnd if they reach goal, I can get points from them.\n\nBut if I don’t trade, I get:\n- 20 + 5×(14–5 + 2) = 20 + 5×11 = 20 + 55 = 75 points (since I use 5 Red and 1 Green → 14−5 = 9 Red, 2−1 = 1 Green, so 10 chips left → 10×5 = 50 + 20 = 70? Wait — no.)\n\nWait, let's recalculate scoring:\n\nFinal score = 20 + (5 × number of chips left at end)\n\nMy chips at start:  \n- Red: 14  \n- Green: 2  \n- Blue: 0\n\nMy path uses:  \n- 5 Red  \n- 1 Green  \n\nSo I will end with:  \n- Red: 9  \n- Green: 1  \n- Blue: 0  \nTotal chips: 10 → 5×10 = 50 → total score: 20 + 50 = 70\n\nNow, if I help the other player cover, say, 2 Red moves (cost 2 Red chips), then I must **commit** to covering 2 Red moves for them. That means I lose 2 Red chips *from my inventory* (they don’t give me back chips — I just cover the cost).\n\nSo after covering 2 Red moves, I have 12 Red chips, but I still only need 5 for my path → so I will have 12−5 = 7 Red left.\n\nBut I also used 1 Green.\n\nSo final chips: 7 Red + 1 Green = **8 chips** → 5×8 = 40 → total score: 20 + 40 = 60 → **10 less** than before.\n\nSo unless I get more than 10 points from them, I lose.\n\nBut I can get up to 20 points from them if they reach goal.\n\nSo if I get **11 points** from them, then my total score becomes: 60 + 11 = 71 → **better than 70**.\n\nBut wait — only if they *actually reach their goal*.\n\nSo the contract must be:  \n- If they reach goal, they give me **11 points**.  \n- I cover 2 Red moves for them.\n\nBut they can choose *not* to take that deal — they can try to go another way.\n\nBut their only viable path likely requires 2 Red moves. If I don’t cover, they can't go.\n\nSo they must accept.\n\nBut I must benefit **strictly more** than I would without cooperation.\n\nWithout cooperation: I get 70.\n\nWith cooperation: I get (60 + points from them)\n\nSo I need: 60 + X > 70 → X > 10\n\nSo I need at least **11 points** from them.\n\nBut they can only give me up to 20.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nAlternatively, I could offer to cover **more** Red moves — say 3 — but that costs me 3 Red chips → I’d have 11 Red, so after using 5 → 6 left → 6×5 = 30 → 20 + 30 = 50 → minus 3 Red used → I get X points → need 50 + X > 70 → X > 20 → impossible.\n\nSo I can only afford to cover **2 Red moves** at most, and still profit if I get **11+** points from them.\n\nNow, what about the *other player*? Do they benefit?\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:  \n(0,0): G → Green → they have 2 Green → OK  \n(1,0): B → Blue → they have 14 Blue → OK  \n(1,1): R → Red → they have 0 → stuck  \n(1,2): B → Blue → OK  \n(2,2): R → Red → stuck  \n(3,2): R → Red → stuck  \n(3,3): G → Green → they have 2 → OK  \n\nSo they need to cover **3 Red tiles**: (1,1), (2,2), (3,2)\n\nThey have 0 Red chips → cannot move to any Red tile unless someone covers it.\n\nSo they are completely stuck unless someone covers Red.\n\nSo if I cover **all 3 Red moves** for them, they can go.\n\nBut if I cover 3 Red moves, I use 3 Red chips → I now have 11 Red.\n\nMy path uses only 5 → so I end with 6 Red, 1 Green → 7 chips → 35 + 20 = 55 → unless they give me at least 20 points, I don’t gain.\n\n55 + 20 = 75 → better than 70.\n\nWait — 55 + 20 = 75 > 70 → so it's profitable.\n\nBut I need to cover 3 Red moves — cost 3 Red chips.\n\nCan I afford that?\n\nYes — I have 14, use 3 → 11 → still enough for my 5 Red cost → so I have 6 left.\n\nFinal chips: 6 Red + 1 Green = 7 → 35 → 20 + 35 = 55\n\nIf they reach goal, I get 20 → 55 + 20 = 75 > 70 → **25% increase**.\n\nYes! This is better.\n\nBut can I offer to cover only 2 of them? Then they still can't go (need 3).\n\nSo I must cover all 3.\n\nNow, do they benefit?\n\nIf I don’t cover, they can’t reach goal → score 0.\n\nIf I cover 3 Red moves, they can go → their chip usage:\n\nThey have: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nTheir path:  \n(0,0): G → pay 1 G → 1 left  \n(1,0): B → 1 B → 13 left  \n(1,1): R → I cover → they pay nothing  \n(1,2): B → 1 B → 12 left  \n(2,2): R → I cover → they pay nothing  \n(3,2): R → I cover → they pay nothing  \n(3,3): G → pay 1 G → 0 left\n\nSo they spend: 2 G, 1 B (in 1,0) and 1 B (in 1,2) → total: 1 G (start), then 1 G at end → 2 G used → OK\n\n1 B at (1,0) → 1 B at (1,2) → 2 B used → they have 14 → plenty → so yes, they can survive.\n\nSo I can help them reach goal.\n\nThey will get: 20 + (5 × number of chips left)\n\nThey started with 16 chips (14B + 2G), used 2G + 2B = 4 chips → so 12 left → 12×5 = 60 → score: 80.\n\nSo they gain 80 by getting help.\n\nSo they can offer me up to 20 points — and they still get 80.\n\nI get 55 + 20 = 75 > 70 → I gain 5 points.\n\nSo this trade is **strictly beneficial** for me.\n\nBut I can do better.\n\nWait — **can I require them to pay me 20 points**? Yes, and I still gain 5.\n\nBut I could also offer to cover only 2 of the 3, then they can’t finish — so I must cover all 3.\n\nNow, can I go even further?\n\nAlternative: what if I don’t want to help them at all — I just go on my path.\n\nScore: 70.\n\nBut if I help them fully (cover all 3 Red moves), and they reach goal, I get 20 points → total 75.\n\nSo I gain 5.\n\nBut is there a way to get more?\n\nOnly if they pay more — but I can’t charge more than 20.\n\nSo 20 is max.\n\nSo maximum I can get is 20 → I end with 55 + 20 = 75.\n\nBut I previously thought 60 + 11 = 71 — worse.\n\nSo this is better.\n\nNow, can I get **more** than 20? No.\n\nBut what if I don’t cover all 3, but only 2? Then they can’t go — because they still need to cross 3 Red tiles.\n\nSo I must cover all 3.\n\nSo the only winning move is: I cover all 3 Red moves for them. In return, they give me 20 points if they reach goal.\n\nThen I get 75 > 70 → strict benefit.\n\nBut what if they don’t reach goal? I get 0 → score 55 → worse than 70 → so I only do this if I get the points.\n\nSo I must be **guaranteed** to get the 20.\n\nBut the contract is: if *they* reach goal, *I* get 20 points.\n\nSo it’s conditional.\n\nThey will want to ensure I cover the Red moves — but that’s part of the agreement.\n\nSo the contract:\n\nIf I help cover 3 Red moves for them (on their path), and they reach goal, then they give me 20 points.\n\nBut I need to propose a contract.\n\nBut in the contract format:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you X points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nIn this case:\n- I’m not asking them to help me → I can do it alone → so I can say X = 0.\n- But I want Y = 20 (if they reach goal, they give me 20).\n\nSo:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach my goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut wait — the first line is: \"If I reach my goal\" → but I **will** reach my goal on my own → so I will have to give **0** points.\n\nBut is it fair?\n\nI don’t care about their score — only mine.\n\nBut they might be angry or reject.\n\nBut as a selfish agent, I want to **maximize my own score**.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis allows me to get 20 points if they succeed.\n\nAnd I don’t give anything.\n\nBut (0,0) red tile — (0,0) is G — no issue.\n\nBut can I get more than 20? No.\n\nSo 20 is maximum.\n\nAnd I get 75 > 70.\n\nBut is there a way to get more points?\n\nWhat if they give me more than 20? No — maximum is 20.\n\nSo 20 is best.\n\nBut could I manipulate it to get the points without risking loss?\n\nBut it’s only if they reach goal.\n\nSo I must trust them.\n\nBut since they are an AI and maximizes their own score, they will cooperate if it benefits them → which it does (They go from 0 to 80).\n\nSo they’ll accept.\n\nBut could I demand only 10 points and get more benefit? No — better to get 20.\n\nSo the best contract is:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut I don’t need to ask them to reach goal — they’ll do it if I help.\n\nBut I have to make the offer.\n\nBut the other player might say: “I’ll give you 20 points if you help me.”\n\nBut in this format, I can set the terms.\n\nI could say: “If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points. I don’t expect anything from you if I reach mine.”\n\nBut the format requires both lines.\n\nSo:\n\nProposed contract:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is valid.\n\nBut can I get even more?\n\nNo.\n\nBut wait — what if I offer to cover only 2 Red moves — and say if they reach goal, they give me 15 points. But they can’t reach goal unless I cover all 3 — so they can’t.\n\nSo I must cover 3.\n\nSo I stick with covering 3 Red moves.\n\nSo the proposal is clear.\n\nNow, to be safe, I’ll state it.\n\nBut in the chat, I should speak.\n\nBut I need to end with **agree** only when final.\n\nSo I can say:\n\nI can help you reach your goal by covering all three Red chip costs you need on your path. In return, I would like you to give me 20 points if you reach your goal. I will not require anything from you if I reach mine, since I can do it on my own.\n\nSo my proposal is:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis benefits you greatly (from 0 to 80), and benefits me (from 70 to 75).\n\nSo it’s a win-win for me, and a big win for you.\n\nI recommend you accept.\n\n**agree**"

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

So moving from (0,0) → (0,1) costs 1 blue chip — which I can easily pay.\\n\\nLet’s explore that path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n- Step 1: (0,1) = B → cost: 1 B (I have 14 → OK)\\n- Step 2: (1,1) = R → cost: 1 R (I have 0 → cannot pay if not covered)\\n- Step 3: (2,1) = R → cost: 1 R (again)\\n- Step 4: (3,1) = R → cost: 1 R\\n- Step 5: (3,2) = R → cost: 1 R\\n- Step 6: (3,3) = G → cost: 1 G (I have 2 → OK)\\n\\nSo total red cost: 4 red chips. I have 0. So unless the other player covers 4 red moves for me, I can't take this path.\\n\\nBut notice: the other player has 14 red chips — they don’t mind covering red moves. If I ask them to cover up to 4 red moves in exchange for me covering some of their green or blue moves?\\n\\nWait — they have only 2 green chips. Their own path might require green too. And they’re at (0,0), same as me. Their goal is also (3,3).\\n\\nTheir best path: They need green and blue. But they have 0 blue and 14 red, 2 green. So they are also short on blue. Their path must likely involve using red tiles where possible.\\n\\nBut crucially: I have 14 blue chips (plenty)"

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

The only way I could use red chips in the future would be if they agreed to cover some of my red moves now — but since they are already done, they have no incentive to help me further. Moreover, any promise they made was conditional on me helping them reach goal (which I did: I gave them 20 points via contract if they reached goal).

Since they have already reached the goal (at (3,3)) and are not moving, I cannot negotiate further with them. However, I can still make moves toward my goal. I need to move to (1,1) first.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
