Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (1, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I lack) is not viable due to red tile requirements. However, a feasible alternative path is: (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3). This path requires chips: R: 2, B: 2, G: 1. I currently have no red chips, so I cannot complete this path without trading. The other player has 11 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. The alternative short path from (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires more red chips and is worse. But a better option exists: move to (2, 1) first, which is a red tile. From (1,0), moving to (2,1) is invalid—it’s diagonal. So valid adjacent moves are: (1,1) [R], (2,0) [B], (1,-1) invalid, (0,0) [G]. Among these, (1,1) is R—can’t afford. (2,0) is B—costs 1 blue. I have 13 blue chips, so I can afford it. Moving to (2,0) gives me access to a path: (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path uses: R: 2 (tiles (2,1) and (3,1)), B: 2 (tiles (2,0), (3,2)? No—(3,2)=R; (2,0)=B, (3,1)=R, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G. So tile colours: (2,0)=B, (2,1)=R, (3,1)=R, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G — requires: B:1, R:3, G:1. I have 13 B and 2 G but 0 R. Still need 3 red chips. But if I go to (2,0), I can then propose a trade with the other player who has 11 R and only 2 G. They are likely willing to trade for blue or green. But my goal is to minimize risk and maximize score. Since I have enough blue, I can reach (2,0) safely. From there, I can either try to trade on (2,0) or plan next move. However, note that the game allows me to move only one square per turn. The most efficient move that keeps options open is to move to (2,0). It costs 1 blue chip (I have 13), and it gets me closer to potentially accessing red tiles via trade. Moreover, since the contract says that if the other player reaches the goal, they give me 1 point, but if I reach the goal, they get 0 points, there’s no direct benefit in helping them finish early. But if I delay their progress by not letting them move, they might not be able to trade with me. However, since we’re both going to (3,3), and I am trying to maximize *my* score, I should prioritize *my* safe and profitable path. The key insight: the path from (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires 3 red chips. But I don’t have any. I need to trade. So I can’t take that full path yet. However, I can still move to (2,0) now because it costs 1 blue chip (I have 13), leaving me with 12 blue and 2 green. Then, on future turns, I can propose a trade: offer blue or green chips for red chips. The other player has excess red. I can trade with them later. Since my current goal is to move forward cautiously and avoid getting stuck, moving to (2,0) is safe and strategic. Also, moving to (2,0) makes me closer to tile (3,0) or (2,1), where I may find a way to access red tiles. Import"
