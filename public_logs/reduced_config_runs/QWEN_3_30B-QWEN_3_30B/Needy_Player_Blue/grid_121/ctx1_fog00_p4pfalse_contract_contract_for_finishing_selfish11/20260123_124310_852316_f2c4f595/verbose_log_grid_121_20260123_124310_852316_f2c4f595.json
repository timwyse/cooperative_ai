You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

So I don’t need to trade with you at all.  \n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red. Their path requires blue chips, which I don’t have. They cannot reach their goal without trading with me — they’d need red or green, but I have no green to trade, and they can’t use blue to pay for tiles that require red or green.  \n\nIn fact, their best path requires 4 blue, 1 red, and 1 green. They have no red. So they need at least 1 red (which I have) and possibly 1 green (which I also have). So they *must* trade with me to reach their goal.  \n\nTherefore, I can be in a strong position: I can reach my goal on my own, but they cannot reach theirs without me.  \n\nSo here's my proposal:  \n*If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.*  \n*If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.*  \n\nThis gives me the maximum possible reward if they succeed. But I don’t pay anything — I don’t need to help them — yet I can get 20 points if they succeed. That’s a way to exploit the situation: incentivize them to help me, but I retain all the upside.  \n\nBut wait — do I even need to cooperate? I don’t need to trade. I can reach my goal alone, and I’ll get 20 + (14 - 5 = 9) red left → 20 + 5×9 = 65 points.  \n\nBut if I let them reach their goal, and I get 20 points from them for helping, I would get 20 points, but I still get to complete my own goal → 20 + 45 = 65 points. Same score.  \n\nWait — I don’t get extra points for *them* helping me. I’m not receiving anything for helping them. I only get points for reaching my goal *and* for chips left.  \n\nSo if I do nothing, I get 65 points.  \n\nIf I block them, I get 65.  \n\nIf I help them, I still get 65, *plus* 20 from them for my help → 85 points.  \n\nBut only if they reach their goal.  \n\nSo if they reach their goal, I get 85. Otherwise, I get 65.  \n\nBut I can still get 65 anyway by going on my own.  \n\nBut here’s the key: if I help them reach their goal (by giving them chips), I must *also* go to my goal — I can’t just help them and not go to mine.  \n\nSo if I help them, I must still complete my own path — and I can. So I will get my 65 from my own completion, plus 20 from them. So 85.  \n\nBut can I get more than 65? Only if I can get them to pay me more.  \n\nBut they can’t pay more than 20. So maximum I can get from them is 20.  \n\nSo total max: 65 + 20 = 85.  \n\nBut I can’t get more than that.  \n\nBut why would I pay them anything? I don’t need to.  \n\nBut could I get *more* by not cooperating? No — 65 is less than 85.  \n\nTherefore: cooperating with them and getting 20 from them if they reach their goal is better than going alone.  \n\nBut do I need to *help* them? I don’t have to — but if I do, I get extra points.  \n\nBut I can only get 20 extra.  \n\nBut if I don’t help them, they might not reach goal → I get 65.  \n\nIf I help them and they reach goal → I get 85.  \n\nSo I want to help them, but only if they give me 20 for their success.  \n\nBut they may be unwilling. But I can force them to accept by threatening to block their path — but I don’t have to.  \n\nBut I want to *get* 20 from them if they succeed.  \n\nSo proposal:  \n\n*If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.*  \n*If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.*  \n\nThis is a win for me: I get 20 extra points if they succeed, and I still get to go to my goal.  \n\nBut can I get more? Only if I can get them to give more, but they can’t. Max is 20.  \n\nSo this is optimal.  \n\nBut — do they have any incentive? They need my help to reach their goal. Otherwise, they can’t get any points.  \n\nSo if I say “I’ll help you, but only if you give me 20 points when you reach goal”, they might accept — because otherwise, zero.  \n\nSo I propose:  \n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\n\n**agree**"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.
