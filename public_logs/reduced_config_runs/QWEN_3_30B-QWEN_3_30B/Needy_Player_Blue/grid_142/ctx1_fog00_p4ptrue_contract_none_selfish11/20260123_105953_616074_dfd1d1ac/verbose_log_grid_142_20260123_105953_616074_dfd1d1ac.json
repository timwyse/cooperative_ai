Looking at possible paths:\\n\\n- Path 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): requires 2 red chips (at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)? Wait — let's check the board colors:\\n  - (1,0): R → needs R chip\\n  - (2,0): B → needs B chip\\n  - (3,0): B → needs B chip\\n  - (3,1): B → needs B chip\\n  - (3,2): R → needs R chip\\n  - (3,3): G → needs G chip\\n  So path has R at (1,0) and (3,2): 2 reds needed. But I have **0 red chips**, so I cannot take this path without help.\\n\\n- Path 2: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3):\\n  - (1,0): R → R\\n  - (1,1): R → R\\n  - (1,2): R → R\\n  - (2,2): R → R\\n  - (3,2): R → R\\n  - (3,3): G → G\\n  Total: 5 red chips, 1 green chip. I have 0 red, 2 green. Still missing 5 red chips.\\n\\nBut wait — there's a potential alternative: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n  - (0,1): B → need B (I have 14 B)\\n  - (0,2): R → need R (I have 0)\\n  Problem again with red.\\n\\nAlternatively: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n  - (0,0): G\\n  - (0,1): B → 1 B (I have 14)\\n  - (1,1): R → need R (0 in my stock)\\n  Again stuck on red.\\n\\nWait — is there any path that doesn't require red? Let's recheck:\\n\\nLook at (0,0) → (1,0): R → no red, can’t go.\\n(0,0) → (0,1): B → okay (I have 14 B)\\nNow from (0,1): B\\n→ (0,2): R → red → need R → I have 0\\n→ (1,1): R → also red → same issue\\nSo blocked unless I get red chips from trade.\\n\\nThe only way forward is via a red tile. But I have zero red chips.\\n\\nNow consider the other player: they are at (1,0), have 13 red chips, 2 green, 0 blue. Their goal is (3,3).\\nThey can easily move through red tiles since they have 13 red chips. They are already on (1,0) — which is red.\\n\\nSo if I want to move toward (3,3), I must pay for red tiles — but I have no red chips. So I **cannot move** unless the other player agrees to cover red moves for me.\\n\\nCan I propose a trade?\\n\\nYes. If I propose that the other player covers my red moves, I can use their red chips to move. Since my path requires red chips (e.g., (1,0), (3,2), etc.), and they have 13 reds, they could cover some red moves for me.\\n\\nBut crucially: I only want to cooperate **if it strictly benefits me**.\\n\\nLet’s compare two scenarios:\\n\\nScenario A: Do not trade. Stay at (0,0). I keep my 14 B and 2 G. I can’t make"

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
