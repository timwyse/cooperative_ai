          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I notice that I have 14 red chips, which is a significant surplus, while I only have 2 green chips and no blue chips. The other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- My current path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n  - Tiles: (1,0)=R, (1,1)=R, (1,2)=R, (2,2)=R, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G\n  - I need 5 red chips and 1 green chip.\n\n- Alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n  - Tiles: (0,1)=B, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B, (1,3)=B, (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G\n  - I need 4 blue chips, 1 red chip, and 1 green chip.\n\nI have no blue chips, so I cannot take the alternative path without help.\n\nBut the other player has 14 blue chips — they could easily cover my blue tile costs on the second path.\n\nHowever, I have 14 red chips. The other player has zero red chips, so they cannot cover any red tiles.\n\nSo if I take the first path, I need to spend 5 red chips and 1 green chip. I have enough of both, so I can complete this path without any trade.\n\nBut if I take the second path, I need 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green — I only have red and green. I’m short 4 blue chips. So I would need to get blue chips from the other player.\n\nBut the other player has 14 blue chips — they can afford to give me blue chips for 4 moves.\n\nBut since this is \"pay for other\" mode, I can propose a trade where I cover their red costs on the second path, and they cover my blue costs on the same path.\n\nWait — let’s check: on the second path, I need to go through 4 blue tiles — (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3). All are blue.\n\nThe other player’s own path to goal is the same — (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nSo they also need to go through those 4 blue tiles.\n\nThey have 14 blue chips, so they could go through with their own chips.\n\nBut they also need to go through (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G.\n\nThey have no red chips — so they're stuck on (2,3) unless I help.\n\nSo if I go through the first path, I can finish with 5 reds, 1 green — only 1 green chip used.\n\nBut they can’t do that because they need red.\n\nIf I go through the second path, I need 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green — I have 2 green, 1 red, but no blue.\n\nThey have 14 blue, but no red — they can’t go through red tiles.\n\nBut if we cooperate, I can cover their red tile (2,3), and they can cover my blue tiles.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- I can pay for (2,3) = R — they need 1 red chip, which I have 14 — I can cover that.\n- They can pay for (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) = B — four blue tiles — they have 14, so they can cover that.\n\nThis way, both of us can complete the second path.\n\nLet’s simulate:\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,1): B → they pay for me → I get to use their blue chip → I save 1 blue\n- (0,2): B → same\n- (0,3): B → same\n- (1,3): B → same\n- (2,3): R → I pay for them → they save 1 red chip → I use 1 red chip from my inventory\n\nSo I use: 1 red, 1 green, and get 4 blue from them.\n\nI started with: 14R, 2G, 0B\n\nAfter: 13R, 1G, and I have 4 blue available from them (but not in my inventory — these are covered by them)\n\nBut per rules: \"chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them)\" — these are not in my inventory, they are commitments.\n\nWait — actually, when I commit to cover a move, it's like I'm offering to pay for it. But I don’t spend my chip until the move happens.\n\nSo if I agree to cover (2,3) for them, I’m saying “I will spend 1 red chip when you move to (2,3)”.\n\nSimilarly, if they cover (0,1) for me, I don’t spend my blue chip — they do.\n\nBut since I don’t have blue chips, but they do, I can avoid using my chips.\n\nAnd since I’m completing the path, I get 20 points, plus 5 per chip remaining.\n\nIf I go through the second path and only use 1 red and 1 green (from my inventory), I keep 12 red, 1 green, and I get 4 blue from them (which are promised to me, but not yet used).\n\nSo at the end, I get: 12 red, 1 green, 4 blue — total 17 chips → 20 + 5×17 = 20 + 85 = 105 points.\n\nAlternatively, if I go through the first path: use 5 red, 1 green — keep 9 red, 1 green — total 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nBut wait — in the first path, I don’t need to trade — I can finish it with no help.\n\nBut only 70 points vs 105 points — so better to trade.\n\nBut can I get more?\n\nWait — if I go through the second path, and they cover 4 blue tiles for me, and I cover 1 red tile for them, at the end:\n\n- I used 1 red and 1 green from my inventory → I have 13 red, 1 green left\n- They used 4 blue → they have 10 blue left\n- I have 4 blue promised (from them), not used → they pay when I move to those tiles → so those 4 blue chips are technically “owed” to me, and count toward my total chip count\n\nSimilarly, they get 1 red promised from me → that counts toward their total.\n\nSo my final chip count: 13 (R) + 1 (G) + 4 (B promised) = 18 chips → 20 + 90 = 110 points\n\nWait — is that right?\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- My inventory: after path, I used 1R and 1G — so 13R, 1G\n- Plus: 4 blue chips promised by them → these are NOT in my inventory, but IF they are not used, they remain as promised and count toward my total.\n\nYes — “If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.”\n\nBut — in this case, the promise is me covering their red move — I did use it (when they move to (2,3)) — so that red chip is spent.\n\nBut the 4 blue chips — they are promised to me — and I used them — so they are used.\n\nWait — no: if I am promising to cover the other player's chippy, it's the other way.\n\nLet’s get this right:\n\n- \"Chips you have promised to cover for other player\" — these are **your** chips that you have committed to pay if they move onto a tile.\n\nSo: if I say “I will cover red for you at (2,3)”, that means when they move to (2,3), I pay 1 red chip from my inventory.\n\nSo I **spend one red chip**.\n\nSimilarly, if they promise to cover blue for me at (0,1), then when I move to (0,1), they pay 1 blue chip from their inventory.\n\nSo:\n\n- I spend 1 red chip (to cover their move to (2,3))\n- They spend 4 blue chips (to cover my moves to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3))\n\nNow, their remaining inventory: 14 - 4 = 10 blue, 2 green, 0 red.\n\nBut they also have a promise: “I owe you 1 red chip” — but since I didn’t promise to cover their red move — I’m covering it, so I spend my red chip when they move.\n\nSo no chip is promised to me in that sense — wait.\n\nThe way it works:\n\n- I must submit a contract: for each tile, who gives what.\n\nSo if I agree:\n- (0,1): You give me a B\n- (0,2): You give me a B\n- (0,3): You give me a B\n- (1,3): You give me a B\n- (2,3): I give you a R\n\nThen:\n- When I move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): they pay the blue chips → those are from their inventory → I get to use blue without paying.\n- When they move to (2,3): I pay the red chip → from my inventory.\n\nNow, at the end:\n\n- My inventory: started with 14R, 2G, 0B\n  - I used 1R to cover their move → 13R left\n  - I did not use any B or G from my inventory in the moves\n  - I did not promise to cover anything for me — so no chip tied to me being promised\n\nWait — but the 4 B chips that they covered for me — I didn’t spend anything — they paid.\n\nBut if they didn’t use those chips, they would still have them — but they spent 4 B chips on my moves.\n\nSo they now have 10B, 2G, 0R.\n\nI have 13R, 2G.\n\nBut the rule says: \"chips you have promised to cover for other player\" — this is me promising to pay for them.\n\n- For (2,3), I promise 1R → so at the end, if they used it — I used the chip → it’s gone.\n- If they didn’t use it — it remains in my inventory, counts as mine.\n\nBut in this case, I used it — so I spent it.\n\nSimilarly, \"chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player\" — this is chips that they promised to pay for me.\n\n- For (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), they promised to cover 1B each → 4B → but these were used, so they were spent.\n\nHowever, if they had promised more than they used, those unused promises would count.\n\nBut in this case, they used exactly the 4 they promised.\n\nSo final chip count:\n\n- Me: 13R, 2G → 15 chips\n- Other: 10B, 2G → 12 chips\n\nBut I get points based on my chips.\n\nSo I get 20 + 5×15 = 20 + 75 = 95 points.\n\nBut earlier I thought I’d get 4 extra blue — but no, I didn’t get them — they were spent by me.\n\nThe promise is that they pay, but I don’t \"get\" the chips — I just don’t pay.\n\nSo my own remaining chips are what count.\n\nSo in this case, I used 1 red chip for their move → so I have 13R, 2G → 15 chips → 95 points.\n\nBut if I just take my first path: use 5R, 1G → have 9R, 1G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nSo 95 > 70 — better.\n\nBut wait — is there a way to get more?\n\nAnother idea: could I propose to let them cover all their moves, and I cover none?\n\nNo — I can’t afford to go through blue tiles — I have no blue chips.\n\nCould I let them go through the blue path, and I go through the red path?\n\nYes — that’s what we’re doing.\n\nBut in this setup, I’m covering their red tile, and they’re covering my blue tiles.\n\nBut if only I had more green — I have 2, and I need 1 green at (3,3) — no problem.\n\nBut what if I propose that I cover their red tile, and they cover my blue tiles — but only if they accept.\n\nNow — can I do better?\n\nWhat if I propose: \"Let’s both go through the middle path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\"\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0)=R\n- (1,1)=R\n- (1,2)=R\n- (2,2)=R\n- (3,2)=R\n- (3,3)=G\n\nI need 5R, 1G — I have 14R, 2G — enough.\n\nThey need 5R, 1G — but they have 0R — so they are stuck.\n\nIf I cover their red tiles, I can do it.\n\nBut I have no green chip to cover their green tile? I have 2 green, and they have 2.\n\nBut if I cover all 5 red tiles for them, I spend 5R — I’ll have 9R left.\n\nBut then I still have 2G.\n\nBut they need to go to (3,3)=G — I don't have to cover that — they can use their own green.\n\nSo if I cover all 5 red tiles for them, they can go through, and I can go through.\n\nBut I need to spend 5 red chips to cover their 5 red moves.\n\nThen I have 9R, 2G — total 11 chips → 20 + 55 = 75 points.\n\nBut previously, with blue path, I got 95 points — better.\n\nSo blue path is better.\n\nNow, in the blue path, I use 1R, 1G — keep 13R, 1G → 14 chips? Wait — 13+1=14 — wait no: 13R + 2G? Wait — I used 1G? Yes, at (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is G — I need to pay for that.\n\nIn the blue path: I go to (3,3) — tile G.\n\nSo I need to pay 1G for my own move.\n\nAnd (2,3)=R — I pay 1R for their move.\n\nSo I spend: 1R, 1G.\n\nI started with 14R, 2G.\n\nSo end with: 13R, 1G → 14 chips.\n\nThen 20 + 70 = 90 points? 5×14 = 70 → 90.\n\nWait — earlier I said 95 — mistake.\n\n13 + 1 = 14 → 5×14 = 70 → 20 + 70 = 90 points.\n\nBut in the red path: use 5R, 1G → 9R, 1G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nSo 90 > 70 — better.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nWhat if I don't go through green at all? But I have to go to (3,3), which is green — I must pay 1G.\n\nSo I must spend 1G.\n\nSimilarly, in blue path, I must pay for my move to (3,3)=G.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow — could I propose that they cover my green? But I have 2 green — they have 2 green — but no red — I can't cover their red move with green.\n\nBut I can propose a different path.\n\nWait — another path: is there a path that uses fewer movements but costs less?\n\nNo — all paths are 6 steps.\n\nBut perhaps a path that avoids high-cost tiles.\n\nBut in this case, blue path is only expensive in blue, which I don't have.\n\nBut since they have blue, and I have red, it’s symmetric.\n\nBut my only real option is to trade.\n\nNow, but I want to maximize my score.\n\nSo in the blue path, with trade: I end with 13R, 1G — 14 chips → 90 points.\n\nBut can I save more?\n\nWhat if I propose: “I will cover your red move at (2,3). You cover my blue moves at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3).”\n\nBut I also have to pay for green at (3,3) — that’s my own cost.\n\nBut is there a way to get more than 14 chips?\n\nWait — if I could not use my green chip — but I can’t — (3,3) is green.\n\nUnless I try to go through another green? But (3,3) is the only green at goal.\n\nAll paths go through (3,3)=G.\n\nSo I must pay 1G.\n\nSimilarly, they must pay 1G.\n\nBut they have 2G — so plenty.\n\nNow — another idea: could I propose that I cover their red move, and also their green move? But I don't need to — they can handle green.\n\nBut if I cover their green move at (3,3), then they spend 1G, and I don’t spend — but I have to give them green — they have 2G, I have 2G — so I could, but why? It doesn't help me — I still have to pay for my own green move. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I notice that the other player has a surplus of red chips (14) but lacks blue and green for their path, while I have a surplus of blue chips (14) but lack red and green for my optimal path.\n\nThe shortest path for both of us to (3,3) requires 6 moves. My current inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, so I can only take a path that minimizes red and green usage.\n\nPath 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n- Tiles: R, R, R, R, R, G → Requires 5 R, 1 G → I have 0 R → cannot take without trade.\n\nPath 2: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- Tiles: B, B, B, B, R, G → Requires 4 B, 1 R, 1 G → I have 0 B, 0 R → need all from trade.\n\nBut the other player has 14 R and 2 G, 0 B — so they can take Path 1 with their red chips, but not Path 2 due to lack of blue.\n\nSo mutual benefit is possible if we align our paths.\n\nProposed contract:\n- I will cover their red move at (2,3) — I have 14 red, they need 1.\n- They will cover my blue moves at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) — they have 14 blue, I need 4.\n\nThis way:\n- I can use Path 2: no cost for blue, 1 red and 1 green from my inventory.\n- They can use Path 1: no cost for red, 1 green from their inventory.\n\nAfter both complete:\n- My inventory: started with 14B, 2G, 0R → I used 1R and 1G → 13B, 1G → 14 chips → 20 + 5×14 = 90 points.\n- Their inventory: started with 0B, 2G, 14R → I used 1R, they used their green → 0B, 1G, 13R → 14 chips → but their score doesn’t matter.\n\nIf I go alone:\n- I can’t use Path 1 due to no red.\n- I can’t use Path 2 due to no blue.\n- So I must trade, or not move.\n\nBut if I don’t move — I get 0 points.\n\nSo trade gives me 90, no trade gives 0.\n\nThus, I strictly benefit.\n\nNow, can I get more than 14 chips? Only if I don’t spend green, but I must — (3,3)=G.\n\nSo minimum I spend: 1G and 1R for the trade.\n\nThus, maximum my chips can be: 14 (B) + 2 (G) - 1 (G) - 1 (R) = 14.\n\nBut wait — I don’t spend blue, so I keep all 14B.\n\nI spend 1G and 1R → 14B + 1G = 15? No — 14B + 1G = 15 chips? But I have only 2G — I use 1G → 1G left.\n\nSo 14B + 1G = 15 chips? But I don’t have 14B — I have 14B, yes, but those are used in the trade? No — the 14B are mine — I don’t spend them.\n\nIn this trade:\n- I do not spend any blue chip — they spend 4 blue for my moves.\n- I spend 1 red and 1 green from my inventory for my own moves.\n\nSo I keep:\n- 14B (all mine, not used)\n- 1G (since I used 1, started with 2)\n- 13R (used 1, started with 0? Wait — I started with 0 red! Oh no.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nI started with {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nSo I have no red chips.\n\nBut in the trade, I said “I will cover their red move at (2 \n, \nplayer 0: I made a critical error in my initial setup.\n\nLet me correct:\n\nMy inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} — I have **no red chips**.\n\nBut I proposed covering their red move at (2,3) — but I have **zero red chips**, so I cannot do that.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nI cannot cover any red move because I have no red chips.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot cover any move that requires red.\n\nSo my earlier plan is invalid.\n\nRethink.\n\nMy current inventory: 14B, 2G, 0R\n\nOther player: 14R, 2G, 0B\n\nI need to get to (3,3) — any path requires:\n- Path 1: uses 5R, 1G — I have 0R, so cannot.\n- Path 2: uses 4B, 1R, 1G — I have 0R, so cannot.\n\nSo I cannot complete any path without help.\n\nBut to get help, I need to offer something the other player values.\n\nThey have 14R, but need blue and green.\n\nBut I have 14B and 2G.\n\nSo I can offer to cover their blue or green moves.\n\nBut their path: they can take Path 1: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) — tiles: R,R,R,R,R,G — so they need 5R and 1G — they have 14R, 2G — so they can do it alone.\n\nBut they can also take Path 2: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) — tiles: B,B,B,B,R,G — they need 4B, 1R, 1G — they have 0B — so cannot take without help.\n\nSo if I help them with 4B, they can take Path 2 and save their R and G.\n\nBut I have 14B — I can offer to cover their blue moves.\n\nSpecifically:\n- If I cover their 4B moves at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), then they can go through Path 2.\n\nIn return, they can cover my moves — but I need to go through a path that requires colors they have.\n\nBut I can't go through any path without red or green — I have no red, and no blue.\n\nBut I have green — but I need to reach (3,3).\n\nThe only way for me to complete is if they cover a path for me.\n\nBut I need to go through tiles that require blue or red — I can't afford them.\n\nBut they have red and green — but I have no use for green or red if I can't use them.\n\nBut if I can get them to cover a path for me using their red and green.\n\nBut I don't need red — I have no red.\n\nBut if they cover my move to a red tile, they spend their red chip.\n\nBut why would they do that? They can use it for themselves.\n\nBut if I can offer them something valuable.\n\nPerhaps I can propose a different path.\n\nBut all paths go through (3,3)=G — so I need to use green.\n\nBut I have green — I can use my own green.\n\nBut to get there, I need to use other colors.\n\nLet’s list all possible paths and their costs.\n\nPath A: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Tiles: (1,0)=R, (1,1)=R, (1,2)=R, (2,2)=R, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G\n- Need: 5R, 1G — I have 0R, 2G\n\nPath B: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- (0,1)=B, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B, (1,3)=B, (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G\n- Need: 4B, 1R, 1G — I have 14B, 0 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I have 14 blue chips, 2 green chips, and 0 red chips.\n\nThe other player has 14 red chips, 2 green chips, and 0 blue chips.\n\nMy goal is (3,3) — I must pay for each tile I move to.\n\nAll paths require either red or blue tiles that I cannot afford without a trade.\n\nBut I can offer to cover their red or green moves if they help me with the cost of blue.\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\nThe other player's only viable path is Path A: going through red tiles, since they have no blue chips.\n\nPath A: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Tiles: all R except final G → requires 5R, 1G — they have both — so they can complete this path alone.\n\nThey could take Path B: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Tiles: B,B,B,B,R,G — requires 4B, 1R, 1G — they have no blue chips — so they cannot take it unless I help.\n\nSo if I cover their blue moves on Path B, they can use that shorter path and save their red and green chips.\n\nBut why would they want to do that? They can complete via Path A with less risk.\n\nBut if I cover their blue moves, they don't need to use their red or green for blue tiles.\n\nBut they still need to use red and green for their own path.\n\nWait — in Path B, they need 1R and 1G — same as Path A.\n\nBut Path B might be better if they want to avoid red, but not necessarily.\n\nHowever, I can propose a contract where I cover their blue moves on Path B, and in return, they cover my moves on a path that uses blue or green.\n\nBut I have no red chips — so I cannot take any path that requires red unless they cover it for me.\n\nBut they have no blue chips — so they cannot cover blue for me.\n\nBut I have blue — so I can cover blue for myself.\n\nLet’s swap perspectives.\n\nSuppose I go through Path B: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1)=B: I need to pay 1B → I have 14 → possible\n- (0,2)=B: 1B → possible\n- (0,3)=B: 1B → possible\n- (1,3)=B: 1B → possible\n- (2,3)=R: I need to pay 1R → I have 0 → cannot\n- (3,3)=G: 1G → I have 2 → possible\n\nSo I am stuck at (1,3) because I need 1R.\n\nBut if the other player covers my move to (2,3), then I can proceed.\n\nThat is: they promise to cover 1 red chip for me at (2,3).\n\nIn return, I can promise to cover their moves to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) — which are blue.\n\nSo I can pay 4 blue chips from my inventory.\n\nLet’s simulate:\n\nContract:\n- (0,1): I give you a B\n- (0,2): I give you a B\n- (0,3): I give you a B\n- (1,3): I give you a B\n- (2,3): You give me a R\n\nNow:\n- When I move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): I receive 1B from them, so their inventory loses 4B.\n- But I have 14B — I don’t spend them — instead, I *receive* the payment? No.\n\nClarify: In \"pay for other\" mode, when I say \"I give you a B\", it means I commit to paying for your blue move — so when you move to a blue tile, I pay one B from my inventory.\n\nSimilarly, when you say \"You give me a R\", you mean you will pay the red chip for my move.\n\nSo in this case:\n- I promise to cover their moves to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) — so when they move there, \n, \nplayer 0: I have 14 blue chips, 2 green chips, and 0 red chips.\n\nThe other player has 14 red chips, 2 green chips, and 0 blue chips.\n\nMy goal is (3,3). To reach it, I must move through tiles that cost chips. But I cannot afford:\n- Red tiles: I have 0 red chips\n- Blue tiles: I have 14 blue — so I can afford them if they don't require payment from me\n\nBut I can only move to a tile if I pay its color cost — or someone else covers it.\n\nNow, the only path that avoids red for me is Path B: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (0,1): B — I need to pay 1B or have someone cover it\n- (0,2): B — same\n- (0,3): B — same\n- (1,3): B — same\n- (2,3): R — I need 1R\n- (3,3): G — I need 1G\n\nI can cover the first four moves (blue) with my own blue chips? No — in this system, \"pay for other\" means I promise to cover their cost if they are moving onto my chip color? Wait no.\n\nStandard rules:\n\nWhen you say \"I give you a color\", it means: **I will pay for your move onto a tile of that color**.\n\nFor example:\n- If I say at (0,1): \"I give you a B\", then when you move to (0,1), I pay the blue chip cost — meaning you don’t use your blue chip.\n\nSimilarly, if you say \"You give me a R\", then when I move to a red tile, you pay the red chip cost — I don’t spend mine.\n\nSo in this contract:\n\nIf I propose:\n- (0,1): I give you a B  → so when *you* move to (0,1), I pay for it with my blue chip.\n- (0,2): I give you a B\n- (0,3): I give you a B\n- (1,3): I give you a B\n- (2,3): You give me a R → when *I* move to (2,3), you pay for it with your red chip.\n\nThis way:\n- For my movement to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): since it’s not me paying, but you paying — I don’t use any of my chips for those.\n- But for (2,3): you pay the red chip — I use zero red chips.\n\nAnd for (3,3)=G: I must pay 1G from my inventory — I have 2G, so possible.\n\nNow, after the trade:\n\n- When you move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): you spend 1 blue each → you lose 4B — but you have 0B! You start with 0B — so you can't afford to spend blue chips.\n\nAh — critical mistake.\n\nYou cannot pay for blue tiles if you have no blue chips.\n\nSo if I say \"I give you a B\", it means **I** spend a blue chip from my inventory.\n\nSo for the moves (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), **I** am spending 4 blue chips (from my 14) — because I am covering your move.\n\nThat’s fine — I have 14B.\n\nThen, when you move to (2,3)=R, you say \"You give me a R\" — so when *I* move there, you spend a red chip from your inventory.\n\nThat’s fine — you have 14R.\n\nSo my action:\n- I spend 4B from my inventory (for your moves)\n- I spend 1G from my inventory (for my own move to (3,3))\n- I do not spend any chip for my own moves to (0,1), (0,2), etc. — costs covered by you.\n- And for (2,3), my move cost is covered by you.\n\nBut I still need to pay for my own movement to (0,1)? No — because you are covering it — they are not me.\n\nIn this setup:\n- My first move: from (0,0) to (0,1) — I move to a blue tile.\n- The cost is 1B.\n- But in the contract \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: Turn: 3: I now realize that in \"pay for other\" mode, the roles are clear:\n\n- When **I** say \"You give me a color\" at a tile, it means **I** will be the one paying the cost when I move onto that tile — the chip is taken from **my** inventory.\n- When **I** say \"I give you a color\" at a tile, it means **I** will be the one paying the cost when **you** move onto that tile — the chip is taken from **my** inventory.\n\nIn both cases, I am spending my own chips.\n\nThe only way for me to avoid spending my chips is if the other player agrees to cover a move **for me** — i.e., they say \"You give me a color\" for a tile I move to.\n\nSo let’s correct:\n\nI want to move to (2,3)=R — cost 1R — I have 0R, so I need the other player to cover it.\n\nSo I need them to say: \"You give me a R\" at (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, I can move to (0,1)=B — cost 1B — I have 14B, so I can pay it.\n\nBut I can also ask them to cover it.\n\nBut they have 0B, so they can’t afford to cover my blue moves.\n\nBut if they cover my red move, they spend their red chip.\n\nIn this case, for me to reach (3,3) via Path B:\n\n- (0,0) → (0,1): B — I have 14B, so I can pay 1B\n- (0,1) → (0,2): B — I can pay 1B\n- (0,2) → (0,3): B — I can pay 1B\n- (0,3) → (1,3): B — I can pay 1B\n- (1,3) → (2,3): R — I have 0R — so I need them to cover this\n- (2,3) → (3,3): G — I have 2G, so I can pay 1G\n\nSo I need only **one** trade: they cover my move to (2,3) — 1R.\n\nIn return, I can cover their moves to four blue tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) — but that would cost me 4B.\n\nBut they have no blue chips, so they can't afford to cover my blue moves.\n\nBut if I cover their moves to those tiles, I spend 4B — I have 14B, so I can.\n\nBut what do I get? I get to go through the blue tiles without paying, and they get to go through red tiles without paying — but they can't go through red tiles because they have no green for (3,3)? No, they have 2G.\n\nWait — let's think about their path.\n\nIf they go through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) — these are blue tiles — they have 0B, so they can't pay.\n\nSo if I cover their moves to those tiles, they don't pay.\n\nBut why would they want that? They can go through Path A: through 5 red tiles and 1 green.\n\nIn Path A, they use 5R, 1G — they have 14R, 2G — plenty.\n\nSo they don't need to trade.\n\nBut if I propose:\n- (2,3): You give me a R  → I cover their red move at (2,3)\n- And for (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): I give you a B  → I cover their blue moves\n\nThen:\n- When I move to (2,3): they spend 1R — I don't spend.\n- When they move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): I spend 4B — but I have 14B — ok.\n- But they get to go through the blue path without any cost — they save 4B and also use one red in the path? No, they still need to go to (2,3)=R, which is a red tile — but in this case, (2,3) is not on Path A, it's on Path B.\n\nIf they go through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — that's Path B: \n, \nplayer 0: I now realize that in \"pay for other\" mode, the only way I can avoid spending my own chips is if the other player commits to cover a move **for me** — i.e., they say \"You give me a [color]\" at a tile I will move to.\n\nTo reach (3,3) via Path B: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,1): B — I have 14B, so I can pay this myself.\n- (0,2): B — same.\n- (0,3): B — same.\n- (1,3): B — same.\n- (2,3): R — I have 0R, so I cannot pay — I need them to cover this.\n- (3,3): G — I have 2G, so I can pay.\n\nSo the **only cost I cannot bear is 1 red chip at (2,3)**.\n\nIf the other player agrees to cover my move to (2,3), then I can complete the path using only:\n- 4B from my inventory (for the first four moves)\n- 1G from my inventory (for the last move)\n- And 1R covered by them (not spent from mine)\n\nFinal chip count:\n- B: 14 - 4 = 10\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- R: 0\n- Total: 11 chips → 20 + 5×11 = 20 + 55 = 75 points\n\nBut is this better than not moving? 0 points — yes.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nWhat if I ask them to cover more of my move costs? But they have no blue or green — they can't cover blue or green for me.\n\nOnly red.\n\nBut if they cover only the one red move, I get 75.\n\nBut wait — what if I propose a different trade? For example, I cover their red moves on Path A, but they cover *my* moves on Path B.\n\nLet’s try:\n\nSuppose I cover their 5 red moves on Path A (1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2) — each R requires 1R.\n\nI spend 5R — but I have 0R! So I cannot afford to cover any red move.\n\nSimilarly, I can’t promise to cover any red tile costs because I have no red chips.\n\nTherefore, the only thing I can offer is covering their blue moves — but they have no blue — so they can't afford to cover that either.\n\nSo I can only request that they cover my red move.\n\nAnd in return, I can cover their blue moves — but why would they want that? They can go through Path A with their red and green chips.\n\nThe only reason they would accept is if going through Path B saves them something.\n\nBut Path B requires 4B, 1R, 1G — they have 0B, so they’d need to use their R and G for it.\n\nPath A: 5R, 1G — same green usage, more red.\n\nSo Path A uses 5R, Path B uses 1R.\n\nSo Path B is cheaper in red.\n\nBut Path B has 4B — which they can't afford — so they must get help.\n\nIf I cover their 4B moves on Path B, plus I cover their green move? But I have 2G — but they have 2G — so I could, but why?\n\nBut if I cover their blue moves and also their green move, then they can go through Path B using only 1R — they save 4R compared to Path A.\n\nAnd they have 14R — so saving 4R is valuable.\n\nMeanwhile, I am asking for them to cover 1R for me — but I have no R — so I save 1R cost.\n\nBut I have to cover 4B for them — I spend 4B.\n\nBut in the end:\n- They save 4R — so they end with 18R instead of 14? No — they start with 14R — if they use 1R in Path B, they have 13R left.\n\nIf I cover their 4B moves, they don't spend anything for B — so they still use 1R and 1G — so final: 13R, 1G — same as before.\n\nBut if they go through Path A, they use 5R and 1G — final: \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 4: Turn: 4: I now fully understand the exchange.\n\nMy goal is to reach (3,3) = G. My only viable path is Path B: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).\n\nI have:\n- 14B — can cover B costs for myself\n- 2G — can cover G cost at (3,3)\n- 0R — cannot cover R cost at (2,3)\n\nSo I must request that the other player cover my move to (2,3)=R.\n\nIn return, I can offer to cover their moves to four blue tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3).\n\nThey currently have:\n- 14R — can afford red moves\n- 2G — can afford green moves\n- 0B — cannot afford blue moves\n\nIf they go through Path A: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Uses 5R, 1G — they spend 5R and 1G\n\nIf they go through Path B instead: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Uses 4B, 1R, 1G — but they have no B, so they need help with B\n\nBut if I cover their 4B moves, then they can use Path B and only spend 1R and 1G, saving 4R.\n\nThat means they end with 13R, 1G instead of 9R, 1G.\n\nSince final score depends on chips remaining, this is a benefit to them.\n\nMeanwhile, I gain by not spending any red chip for (2,3).\n\nNow, in the trade:\n- I promise to cover their moves to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): each one costs 1B from me — total 4B spent.\n- They promise to cover my move to (2,3): costs 1R from them.\n\nAfter both complete:\n- My inventory: started with 14B, 2G, 0R\n  - I used 4B for their moves\n  - I used 1G for my own move to (3,3)\n  - I did not use any R (covered by them)\n  - Final: 10B, 1G → 11 chips → 20 + 5×11 = 75 points\n\n- Their inventory: started with 14R, 2G, 0B\n  - They used 1R for my move to (2,3)? No — when I move to (2,3), they pay the red chip — so they spend 1R\n  - But also, when they move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), I am covering it — so I spend 4B — they don't spend B\n  - They still need to pay for (2,3)=R — but they are covering *my* move, not their own? Wait.\n\nWait — in this contract:\n\n- For (0,1): I give you a B → so when **you** move to (0,1), I pay 1B from my inventory → you don’t pay anything.\n- Similarly for (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): you don’t pay.\n- For (2,3): You give me a R → so when **I** move to (2,3), you pay 1R from your inventory.\n\nSo when **they** move to (0,1), etc., they do not spend B — I cover it.\n\nWhen **I** move to (2,3), they cover it — so I don’t spend R.\n\nBut what about their own move to (2,3)? If they go through Path B, they also move to (2,3)=R — so they must pay 1R.\n\nOh! Critical issue.\n\nIf they go through Path B, they must also move to (2,3)=R — and they have no R to spare.\n\nBut in the contract, I am only agreeing to cover **my** move to (2,3), not theirs.\n\nSo if they want to go through Path B, they still need to cover their \n, \nplayer 0: I now see the flaw in my previous thinking.\n\nIf I propose:\n- (0,1): I give you a B → I cover your move to (0,1)\n- (0,2): I give you a B → I cover your move to (0,2)\n- (0,3): I give you a B → I cover your move to (0,3)\n- (1,3): I give you a B → I cover your move to (1,3)\n- (2,3): You give me a R → you cover my move to (2,3)\n\nThen:\n- For you (the other player) to move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3): you pay 0 chips — I cover it.\n- For you to move to (2,3): you still need to pay 1R, because the contract only covers my move to (2,3), not yours.\n\nBut you have 0R — so you can't afford it.\n\nSo you cannot complete Path B unless you also cover your own move to (2,3).\n\nTo let you go through Path B, I must cover **your** move to (2,3) as well.\n\nBut you have no R — so you would have to spend 1R for your own move.\n\nBut I cannot cover it because I have no R to give.\n\nSo the only way for you to go through Path B is if you have 1R to spend for your own move.\n\nBut you can't afford it.\n\nTherefore, you cannot complete Path B.\n\nYou can only complete Path A.\n\nSo if you go through Path A, you need to pay 5R and 1G.\n\nYou have 14R, 2G — so you can.\n\nBut there's no incentive for you to move to (0,1), etc., unless you want to.\n\nBut if you go through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), you must pay 4B — and you have 0B — impossible.\n\nSo your only viable path is Path A.\n\nTherefore, you cannot benefit from covering my blue moves.\n\nBut I can still get benefit if I propose to cover your red moves on Path A, but you have no B — you can't cover my moves.\n\nNo.\n\nThe only thing I can do is propose a contract where you cover my move to (2,3)=R, and in return, I cover your move to a tile that costs blue — but you can't afford to be covered for blue.\n\nSo I am stuck.\n\nUnless... I ask you to cover my move to (2,3), and you do, and I don't ask for anything back.\n\nThen I can go through Path B.\n\nYou cover my red move at (2,3) — you spend 1R.\n\nI then go through Path B:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): I pay 1B (from my 14)\n- (0,1) → (0,2): I pay 1B\n- (0,2) → (0,3): I pay 1B\n- (0,3) → (1,3): I pay 1B\n- (1,3) → (2,3): you pay 1R (contract)\n- (2,3) → (3,3): I pay 1G\n\nFinal chip count: 14-4 = 10B, 2-1 = 1G, 0R → 11 chips → 75 points.\n\nBut if you do nothing, you can complete Path A with 5R and 1G — you end with 9R, 1G — 10 chips.\n\nBut you have to spend 1R to cover me — so you end with 13R, 1G — 14 chips.\n\nSo you gain 4 more chips.\n\nBut the contract is bilateral — I can't force you.\n\nYou will only accept if it benefits you.\n\nSince you gain 4 chips, you have incentive to accept.\n\nFor me, 75 points > 0, so I benefit.\n\nSo I can propose:\n- I give you a R at (2,3): you cover my move.\n- Nothing else.\n\nBut the rules require that all tiles where I need a chip be covered.\n\nIn this case, I need to cover (2,3) for myself — but you cover it.\n\nBut I still need to pay for (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (3,3) myself.\n\nBut they are covered by me — no problem.\n\nSo the contract is:\n- (2,3): \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 5: (2,3): You give me a R  \n(0,1): I give you a B  \n(0,2): I give you a B  \n(0,3): I give you a B  \n(1,3): I give you a B  \n\nThis way:\n- When I move to (2,3), you cover the 1R cost — I don't spend any red chip.\n- When you move to (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), I cover the 1B cost each — so you don't spend any blue chips.\n\nYou save 4 blue chips (which you can't afford anyway) and use only 1R instead of 5R if you took Path A — but you still have to pay for your own moves to (2,3)=R and (3,3)=G.\n\nFor you to complete Path B:\n- (0,0) → (0,1): I cover 1B\n- (0,1) → (0,2): I cover 1B\n- (0,2) → (0,3): I cover 1B\n- (0,3) → (1,3): I cover 1B\n- (1,3) → (2,3): you must pay 1R — but you have 14R, so ok\n- (2,3) → (3,3): you must pay 1G — have 2G, so ok\n\nSo yes, you can complete Path B with only 1R and 1G spent, saving 4R compared to Path A.\n\nAnd you receive no direct benefit from the 4B you didn't spend — since you had no B, it's not a loss.\n\nBut you save 4R — which is valuable.\n\nFor me, I only need you to cover my move to (2,3)=R — and I don't need to pay for the blue moves myself because I'm covering them.\n\nAnd for (3,3)=G, I pay from my inventory.\n\nFinal: I end with 10B, 1G → 11 chips → 75 points.\n\nYou end with 13R, 1G → 14 chips — better than 9R, 1G.\n\nWe are both better off.\n\nSo this contract is mutually beneficial.\n\nTherefore, I propose:\n\n(0,1): I give you a B  \n(0,2): I give you a B  \n(0,3): I give you a B  \n(1,3): I give you a B  \n(2,3): You give me a R  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (0,1): I give you a B  \n(0,2): I give you a B  \n(0,3): I give you a B  \n(1,3): I give you a B  \n(2,3): You give me a R  \n\nagree \n",
