Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (2, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path to the goal from here is (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), but this path requires chips of colour R (for (3,0)), R (for (3,1)), R (for (3,2)), and G (for (3,3)). However, I have zero R chips in my inventory, and while I have G chips, I don't have enough R chips to traverse this path. My current chip inventory is {'B': 12, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} — so I cannot make any move that requires R without a trade agreement. \\n\\nLooking at alternative routes: the suggested path in the status ('path') is [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]. This requires B (4 times), G (1 time), and R (1 time). I have 12 B chips and 2 G chips, but only 0 R chips. Thus, I am missing 1 R chip for this path.\\n\\nThe other player has 9 R chips and 2 G chips but 0 B chips — they are at (3,2), very close to their goal at (3,3). Their best path to (3,3) is immediate: (3,2) → (3,3), which requires G. They have 2 G chips — sufficient. So they can reach their goal in one step without needing help from me.\\n\\nI now consider whether I can arrange a mutually beneficial trade with them. Since they have R and G, and I have B and G, and we both need to reach (3,3), but I am blocked due to lack of R chips.\\n\\nKey insight: I could offer to cover some of their R moves if they cover my R move(s). But I have no incentive to do so unless I get something strictly better than what I’d otherwise achieve.\\n\\nMy current plan: go from (2,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). That’s 6 steps. I can afford B (all 4 are covered by my 12 B chips), G (1 needed — I have 2), but one R is required (on (1,1)? Let’s verify: \\n- (2,0): B → already on it\\n- (1,0): B → B cost → I have it\\n- (1,1): R → R cost → I need 1, but I have 0 → problem\\nWait — correction: (1,1) is R? Board row 1: [B, R, B, B] → (1,1) = R → yes, so moving to (1,1) requires R chip.\\n\\nSo to take that path, I need 1 R chip. I don’t have it.\\n\\nAlternative path: Is there a shorter path that avoids R? From (2,0), possible moves: \\n- (1,0): B → OK (I have 12 B)\\n- (2,1): R → requires R → I don’t have it\\n- (3,0): R → requires R → can't go\\n- (2,-1): invalid\\n\\nSo only safe move is (1,0). From (1,0), adjacent: \\n- (1,1): R → need R, stuck\\n- (0,0): G → G cost, I have 2 G, so could afford if I had a way to keep using G\\nBut then from (0,0) to (0,1): R → again R, same issue\\n\\nSo, all paths require R moves unless I use a detour through G tiles — but the board doesn’t allow many non-R paths near me.\\n\\nImportant: The other player is at (3,2), and wants to go to (3,3). (3,3) is G. They have 2 G chips, so they can do that move immediately. But if they are not going to move, they could potentially assist me later.\\n\\nNow, can I propose a trade where I cover one of their R moves (they have plenty of R), in return for covering one of my R moves?\\n\\nBut wait: I need one R move. If I can get them"
