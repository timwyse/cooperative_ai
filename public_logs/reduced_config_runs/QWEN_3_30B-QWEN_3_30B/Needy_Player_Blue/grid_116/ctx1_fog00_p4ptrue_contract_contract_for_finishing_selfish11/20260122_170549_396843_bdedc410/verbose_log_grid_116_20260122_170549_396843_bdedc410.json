Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

They need R for their path — they cannot pay for R moves.\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] → 5R + 1G = 6 moves, all possible with my chips.\n\nBut they cannot afford R moves — they need R for their own path, but have 0. So they need help from me.  \nMy path does not require B — they have B: 14, so they can cover B moves.\n\nThey might want to take a path with more B, but they can't make R moves at all.\n\nTheir best path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G] → needs: B:3, R:2, G:1 → but R is missing: 2 needed, 0 in inventory → cannot complete without help.\n\nIf they want to reach goal, they must get R from me. I can cover R moves for them. But they have no R themselves.\n\nSo, I can offer to cover up to 2 R moves for them (since they need at least 2), and if they reach goal, I want a reward.\n\nBut: I can reach my goal alone. I don't need them. So if I help them, I must get at least 20 points in return, or I’m worse off.\n\nBut: if I help them, I must commit R chips to cover their R moves. Each R move costs 1 chip. I must pay 2 R chips to cover them (if I let them take R moves). But I have R:14 → 2 is fine.\n\nBut: what if I don’t help? Then they can’t reach goal (no R), so they get 0. Then I reach goal on my path (5R+1G → I have enough) → I get 20 + 5*chips = 20 + 5*(14-5 + 2-1) = 20 + 5*(9+1) = 20+50 = 70 points.\n\nWait: chips after my path:\n\n- R: 14 - 5 = 9\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Total chips: 10 → 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nIf I help them, I give them 2 R chips to cover their R moves. I must pay for 2 R moves (they move on R tiles). So I pay 2R → I only keep 12R.\n\nBut: they reach goal → they get 20 + 5*chips. But I don’t care about their score — I care about what I get.\n\nBut: I get points only if I reach goal. So if I help them, I can still reach goal alone — as long as I don’t use up all my R.\n\nBut if I help them, I have to cover their R moves. But I can still go my own path — I don’t need to sacrifice my move.\n\nSo: I can reach goal, and help them (by paying for 2 R moves), and still have R:12 left, G:1 → total chips 13 → final score 20 + 5*13 = 85? Wait no — I used 5R in my path, and paid 2R for them → total R used: 7 → I have R:14 - 7 = 7.\n\nWait — I only *commit* R chips to them — but do I lose them now?\n\nImportant: when I agree to cover a move for them, I commit to paying if they step on R — so I must have those chips available. But if I commit, I must keep those chips in my inventory — I cannot use them for myself.\n\nSo: if I commit to covering 2 R moves for them, I must have 2 R chips left after my path.\n\nBut I need 5R for my path.

So they need 2R moves.\n\nThey have B:0, G:2, R:14? Wait — correction: earlier said \"Other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\" — yes, so they have 14R.\n\nWait — that changes everything.\n\nEarlier I misread: other player has R:14, not 0.\n\nLet me recheck:\n\n- Other player’s chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}  \n- They are at (0,0), goal (3,3)\n\nSo they have plenty of R — they can afford any R move.\n\nTheir path: (0,0)→(1,0)[B] — but they have B:0 → cannot pay for B.

(1,0): B → I have B:14 → okay\n- (0,1): R → I cannot afford\n- (1,1): R → I cannot afford\n- So only legal move: (1,0) [B]\n\nNow (1,0): B → can go to (2,0)?

(1,1): R → no\n\nSo only path is dead end: stuck at (2,0) — cannot proceed further.\n\nThus, without help, I cannot reach goal — because every path requires an R tile, and I have no R chips.\n\nTherefore, I **must** cooperate with the other player to reach goal.\n\nSimilarly, they can reach goal alone — but they might want me to cover some B or G moves for them?\n\nBut I have B:14, G:2 — they have B:0, G:2.\n\nSo:\n- They have no B → cannot cover B moves\n- But I have B →"

However, if they help me, I will reach my goal and get a high score, which may incentivize them to help — but only if I give them something in return.\n\nSince they are selfish and only care about their own score, I must offer them a reward that makes it strictly better for them to help me than not to. That is, if I help them, they get more than 20 points (which they’d get if I don’t help them and they go alone).\n\nBut: I can only give them up to 20 points.

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

They need R for their path — they cannot pay for R moves.\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G] → 5R + 1G = 6 moves, all possible with my chips.\n\nBut they cannot afford R moves — they need R for their own path, but have 0. So they need help from me.  \nMy path does not require B — they have B: 14, so they can cover B moves.\n\nThey might want to take a path with more B, but they can't make R moves at all.\n\nTheir best path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [B] → (1,3) [B] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G] → needs: B:3, R:2, G:1 → but R is missing: 2 needed, 0 in inventory → cannot complete without help.\n\nIf they want to reach goal, they must get R from me. I can cover R moves for them. But they have no R themselves.\n\nSo, I can offer to cover up to 2 R moves for them (since they need at least 2), and if they reach goal, I want a reward.\n\nBut: I can reach my goal alone. I don't need them. So if I help them, I must get at least 20 points in return, or I’m worse off.\n\nBut: if I help them, I must commit R chips to cover their R moves. Each R move costs 1 chip. I must pay 2 R chips to cover them (if I let them take R moves). But I have R:14 → 2 is fine.\n\nBut: what if I don’t help? Then they can’t reach goal (no R), so they get 0. Then I reach goal on my path (5R+1G → I have enough) → I get 20 + 5*chips = 20 + 5*(14-5 + 2-1) = 20 + 5*(9+1) = 20+50 = 70 points.\n\nWait: chips after my path:\n\n- R: 14 - 5 = 9\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Total chips: 10 → 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nIf I help them, I give them 2 R chips to cover their R moves. I must pay for 2 R moves (they move on R tiles). So I pay 2R → I only keep 12R.\n\nBut: they reach goal → they get 20 + 5*chips. But I don’t care about their score — I care about what I get.\n\nBut: I get points only if I reach goal. So if I help them, I can still reach goal alone — as long as I don’t use up all my R.\n\nBut if I help them, I have to cover their R moves. But I can still go my own path — I don’t need to sacrifice my move.\n\nSo: I can reach goal, and help them (by paying for 2 R moves), and still have R:12 left, G:1 → total chips 13 → final score 20 + 5*13 = 85? Wait no — I used 5R in my path, and paid 2R for them → total R used: 7 → I have R:14 - 7 = 7.\n\nWait — I only *commit* R chips to them — but do I lose them now?\n\nImportant: when I agree to cover a move for them, I commit to paying if they step on R — so I must have those chips available. But if I commit, I must keep those chips in my inventory — I cannot use them for myself.\n\nSo: if I commit to covering 2 R moves for them, I must have 2 R chips left after my path.\n\nBut I need 5R for my path.

(1,0): B → I have B:14 → okay\n- (0,1): R → I cannot afford\n- (1,1): R → I cannot afford\n- So only legal move: (1,0) [B]\n\nNow (1,0): B → can go to (2,0)?

(1,1): R → no\n\nSo only path is dead end: stuck at (2,0) — cannot proceed further.\n\nThus, without help, I cannot reach goal — because every path requires an R tile, and I have no R chips.\n\nTherefore, I **must** cooperate with the other player to reach goal.\n\nSimilarly, they can reach goal alone — but they might want me to cover some B or G moves for them?\n\nBut I have B:14, G:2 — they have B:0, G:2.\n\nSo:\n- They have no B → cannot cover B moves\n- But I have B →"

That is, if I help them, they get more than 20 points (which they’d get if I don’t help them and they go alone).\n\nBut: I can only give them up to 20 points.

I have 14 blue, 2 green, but only 0 red—so I’m missing 1 red. The other player has 14 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. They likely can’t cover my blue needs, but I can help them with green, as they have none. However, trading red for green is not beneficial to me since I already have 2 green and don’t need more. I can instead trade red for blue: I have no blue excess, so I can’t offer any. No acceptable trade exists that benefits me—I cannot offer surplus chips in exchange for needed ones without losing my advantage. Thus, I should avoid trading. Instead, I’ll use a longer path that doesn't require red, though it costs more steps and fewer chips at end. However, there’s a better alternative: I can accept a promise from them to cover red moves, but currently I have no such promise. Since I must pay my own red cost or get their promise, and they might be willing to cover red if promised something in return, but I have nothing they value (they lack green and blue, but I have excess green). If I offer 2 green to get them to promise to cover 1 red move, then I'd spend 2 green to save 1 red—my red count would go from -1 to zero, and I’d keep 0 green. But I'd lose 2 green, meaning I start with 2 green, and later have 0—net loss of 2 green worth 5 each = 10 pts lost vs. keeping them. Not worth it. So best option: take a path avoiding red entirely. The second-best path uses 5 red and 1 green—but I have 0 red. So I cannot take it. There's another path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which uses G,R,B,B,B,B — no, tile colors: (0,1)=R, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B, (1,3)=B, (2,3)=B, (3,3)=G — that’s R,B,B,B,B,G → R:1, B:5, G:1 — still need 5 blue (I have 14), 1 green (I have 2), 1 red (I have 0). Still missing red. All paths go through a red tile except one: check if any path avoids red entirely. Looking at board: Row 0: G,R,B,B → has R at (0,1). Row 1: B,R,B,B → R at (1,1). Row 2: B,R,R,B → R at (1,1),(2,1),(2,2). Row 3: R,R,R,G → R at all first three. My starting point is (0,0)=G. From (0,0), I can go right to (0,1)=R — forced to use red. Or down to (1,0)=B — no red. Then (1,0)=B → (1,1)=R — again red. So any path from (0,0) to (3,3) must pass through at least one red tile. In fact, minimum red tiles passed is 1. So I must use at least 1 red. Since I have 0 red, I must either get a red chip via trade or get someone to cover the cost. I can ask the other player to promise to cover 1 red move. But I need to give them something valuable in return. They have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. They need blue desperately—no blue. I have 14 blue. So if I offer to let them cover 1 red move in return for them covering my red cost, I’d give them a promise that I cover their red moves? Wait, no: if I propose: 'You promise to cover my red move; I promise you will cover my red move' — but I don’t want to do that. Better: I propose to cover their blue moves in exchange for them covering mine. But I have no red to offer, and they have no blue to offer to me. But I have blue (14) and they need blue. So if I say: I will promise to cover up to X blue moves for you if you cover up to Y red moves for me. But I don’t want to commit to covering their blue unless I get benefit. Let’s calculate: suppose I offer to cover 1 blue move for them (using my blue chip) if they cover 1 red move for me (using their red chip). That’s fair? I give up 1 blue, they give up 1 red. I gain ability to take shorter path. But the trade isn’t direct swap: it’s cost sharing. By agreeing to cover 1 blue move for them, I’m paying 1 blue chip out of my inventory if they step on a blue tile. Same for them. So if I agree to cover 1 blue move for them, I must be compensated by them covering 1 red move for me. This is symmetric. So proposal: 'If you promise to cover my 1 red move, I will promise to cover your 1 blue move.' But I have 14 blue already—they only need 1 blue? Their path may need several, but I don’t know. Their path to goal: they are also at (0,0). Their chips: 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. Goal (3,3)=G. So they need to reach it. Any path will require blue tiles? (0,0)=G → (1,0)=B → yes, must use blue tile. So they need blue. They have 0. So they must get blue covered or trade. So if I offer to cover 1 blue move for them, they could accept, as long as I get something back. So mutual benefit: they cover 1 red for me, I cover 1 blue for them. Each saves one chip. But since I have 14 blue, giving up 1 is negligible. They have 14 red, giving up 1 is also negligible. So it’s fair. And it allows me to take the optimal path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3). This uses: (1,0)=B — blue, (1,1)=R — red, (1,2)=B — blue, (1,3)=B — blue, (2,3)=B — blue, (3,3)=G — green. So blue: 4 times, red: 1 time, green: 1 time. I have sufficient blue (14), green (2), needed 1 red. So if they cover the red cost once, I can use this path. I need to promise them coverage of 1 blue move in return. So contract: I promise to cover 1 blue move for them if they cover 1 red move for me. This benefits both: I get to use red tile without using my own red chip, while they now can use a blue tile without using their own blue chip. Neither party loses chips in inventory. Both just shift cost responsibility. So this is a pure gain in mobility. After this deal, I can proceed. But note: after the contract is signed, I must actually move into blue tiles for the other player to benefit—only when they step on a blue tile and I am covering it, then I pay. But I’m promising to cover 1 blue move, meaning I will pay one blue if they step on any blue tile. But I don’t know if they will use a blue tile—yes, they must. So the deal is valid. So I should propose: I will cover 1 blue move for you if you cover 1 red move for me.

So if I say: I will promise to cover up to X blue moves for you if you cover up to Y red moves for me. But I don’t want to commit to covering their blue unless I get benefit. Let’s calculate: suppose I offer to cover 1 blue move for them (using my blue chip) if they cover 1 red move for me (using their red chip). That’s fair? I give up 1 blue, they give up 1 red. I gain ability to take shorter path. But the trade isn’t direct swap: it’s cost sharing. By agreeing to cover 1 blue move for them, I’m paying 1 blue chip out of my inventory if they step on a blue tile. Same for them. So if I agree to cover 1 blue move for them, I must be compensated by them covering 1 red move for me. This is symmetric. So proposal: 'If you promise to cover my 1 red move, I will promise to cover your 1 blue move.' But I have 14 blue already—they only need 1 blue? Their path may need several, but I don’t know. Their path to goal: they are also at (0,0). Their chips: 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue. Goal (3,3)=G. So they need to reach it. Any path will require blue tiles? (0,0)=G → (1,0)=B → yes, must use blue tile. So they need blue. They have 0. So they must get blue covered or trade. So if I offer to cover 1 blue move for them, they could accept, as long as I get something back. So mutual benefit: they cover 1 red for me, I cover 1 blue for them. Each saves one chip. But since I have 14 blue, giving up 1 is negligible. They have 14 red, giving up 1 is also negligible. So it’s fair. And it allows me to take the optimal path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3). This uses: (1,0)=B — blue, (1,1)=R — red, (1,2)=B — blue, (1,3)=B — blue, (2,3)=B — blue, (3,3)=G — green. So blue: 4 times, red: 1 time, green: 1 time. I have sufficient blue (14), green (2), needed 1 red. So if they cover the red cost once, I can use this path. I need to promise them coverage of 1 blue move in return. So contract: I promise to cover 1 blue move for them if they cover 1 red move for me. This benefits both: I get to use red tile without using my own red chip, while they now can use a blue tile without using their own blue chip. Neither party loses chips in inventory. Both just shift cost responsibility. So this is a pure gain in mobility. After this deal, I can proceed. But note: after the contract is signed, I must actually move into blue tiles for the other player to benefit—only when they step on a blue tile and I am covering it, then I pay. But I’m promising to cover 1 blue move, meaning I will pay one blue if they step on any blue tile. But I don’t know if they will use a blue tile—yes, they must. So the deal is valid. So I should propose: I will cover 1 blue move for you if you cover 1 red move for me. In JSON format.",

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Since I can complete the path without trade and without risk, I should proceed independently. Moving to (3,1) is the best first move toward my goal.",

Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 1}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 5, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('G', 1)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 1)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color R as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 5, Player 1 and Player 0 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 1 would pay [('G', 1)] to Player 0 in exchange for Player 0 at some stage in the future paying for [('R', 1)] to Player 1.\"]\n\nThink step by step about whether to agree to pay for the other player's move. Consider your current chip inventory, your goal, and whether honoring this agreement helps you in the long run. Remember that you are trying to maximize your points.\n\nOnce you have decided, use this EXACT JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"Your thinking process and reasoning for agreeing or refusing to pay\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true or false\n}\n\nExample of agreeing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I have enough R chips and honoring this agreement maintains trust for future cooperation. This helps me reach my goal.\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": true\n}\n\nExample of refusing to pay:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need to conserve my R chips for my own path to the goal. The agreement was made but if I agree to this then I won't have enough R chips to reach my goal.\",\n  \"honor_p4p_agreement\": false\n}\n",
