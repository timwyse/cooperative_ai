        "contract": {
          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I notice that the other player has a surplus of blue chips (14 B) and I have a surplus of red chips (14 R), while both of us have 2 green chips. \n\nLooking at the two potential paths:\n\n1. **My path prioritizing my chips**: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n   - Requires: 5 R, 1 G → I have 14 R and 2 G → fully covered.  \n   - This path doesn't require any trading. I can complete it with no risk.\n\n2. **The other player's preferred path (B-heavy)**: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n   - Requires: 4 B, 1 R, 1 G → They have 14 B, 2 G, but 0 R → So they need 1 R.\n\nBut here's the key: I can reach my goal without trading, using only my own chips. If I don’t trade, I’ll finish with 14 - 5 = 9 R and 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nNow — can the other player reach their goal? Their inventory: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.  \nTheir direct path (using blue-heavy tiles) requires 4 B, 1 R, 1 G → they are missing 1 red chip.\n\nSo they *must* trade for 1 red chip to reach their goal.\n\nBut they have no red chips — I have 14.  \nIf I trade 1 red chip to them in exchange for *a promise* that they will not use the red chip (since they need it), but also if I can benefit...\n\nWait — but I don’t need to trade. I can go straight to goal via my path.  \n\nBut here's the catch: if I *don’t* trade, the other player might not be able to reach goal → they may fail → so they won't get 20 points → but that doesn’t affect me.\n\nHowever, if I offer to trade them 1 red chip for, say, 1 blue chip in return, I get to keep my path — and they get what they need.\n\nBut would that help *me*?\n\nLet’s compare:\n- If I do nothing: I score 70.\n- If I trade 1 R to them and get 1 B from them: I now have 13 R, 3 B, 1 G → I still complete the same path: costs 5 R, 1 G → I’ll have 8 R, 3 B, 0 G → score: 20 + 5*(8+3) = 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nWait — I still have 8 red and 3 blue → total 11 chips → 5*11 = 55 → 20 + 55 = 75 → that’s better than 70.\n\nSo by trading 1 red for 1 blue, I *increase* my final chip count from 10 to 11 → score increases from 70 to 75.\n\nWhy? I spent 5 red chips and 1 green → but got back 1 blue → net gain of 1 chip, and still reached goal.\n\nBut: I need to *ensure* that the trade happens **before** I start moving — and I need to ensure that the exchange happens at a tile where both can transfer.\n\nThe only place that requires a red chip is (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) — all red tiles.\n\nBut the other player doesn’t need to walk on any red tiles unless they use the path. Their path uses: (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) → only (3,2) is red.\n\nSo if I offer to give the other player 1 red chip, and they give me 1 blue chip, we can arrange this at (3,2) — which is on both our paths.\n\nBut can I do it *before* entering (3,2)? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach my goal without trading, using my own chips: path (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]. This costs 5 red and 1 green. I have 14 red and 2 green → I’ll have 9 red and 1 green left, scoring 20 + 5*(9+1) = 70.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red. Their direct path uses: (1,0) [B], (2,0) [B], (3,0) [B], (3,1) [B], (3,2) [R], (3,3) [G] → requires 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green. They are missing 1 red chip → cannot complete unless they trade.\n\nSo the other player *must* get 1 red chip to reach goal.\n\nI have 14 red chips — more than enough.\n\nIf I trade 1 red chip to them for 1 blue chip, then:\n- I gain 1 blue chip (total now 1 blue)\n- I lose 1 red → so 13 red left\n- After completing my path: 13 - 5 = 8 red, 1 green, 1 blue → total 10 chips → score 20 + 5*10 = 70? Wait — 8 + 1 = 9? No.\n\nWait — I had 14 R, 2 G — I spend 5 R and 1 G → so 9 R, 1 G → but I *trade* 1 R for 1 B → so before starting: 13 R, 2 G, 1 B → after: 8 R, 1 G, 1 B → total chips: 10 → 5*10 = 50 → 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nSame as before.\n\nWait — I was wrong earlier — I don’t *gain* a net chip. I trade 1 R for 1 B → the total number of chips remains the same.\n\nBut I don’t benefit — same total chips.\n\nUnless I can get *more* than 1 blue?\n\nBut they only have 14 blue — and they need 4 for their own path — so they can afford to give 1 or more.\n\nBut if I trade 1 red for 2 blue, then:\n- I give 1 red → lose 1\n- I gain 2 blue → gain 2\n- Net +1 chip\n- After trading: 13 R, 2 G, 2 B\n- After path: 8 R, 1 G, 2 B → total 11 chips → score 20 + 5*11 = 75 → better than 70.\n\nYes — if I can get 2 blue chips in exchange for 1 red, I gain +1 chip → score increases from 70 to 75.\n\nBut is that fair? They need only 1 red chip — and they’ll get it. They gain 2 blue chips — which they can use for their path — which only requires 4 blue.\n\nBut they have 14 blue — so they can spare 2.\n\nSo I propose:\n\nAt (3,2), where both paths meet, I will give you 1 red chip and you give me 2 blue chips.\n\nWhy (3,2)? Because:\n- It is the only red tile on my path.\n- It is on their path — they need to pay red there.\n- It is a shared tile where we can coordinate the trade.\n\nIf I make the trade *before* moving to (3,2), I can enter (3,2) without paying red — because I'll have received the red chip from them (or we swap at (3,2)).\n\nBut wait — no: I can’t enter (3,2) without paying red — unless I have a red chip.\n\nBut if I trade 1 red to them, then I don’t *have* a red chip to pay at (3,2).\n\nSo I cannot pay at (3,2) if I’ve already given my red chip.\n\nSo I must have the red chip *before* I enter (3,2).\n\nI must use the red chip to pay at (3,2) → so I need to have it at that tile.\n\nTherefore, the trade must happen **after** I enter (3,2)? But I \n, \nplayer 0: I realize now that I cannot trade *before* moving to (3,2) if I need to pay a red chip there — because I must have the red chip to pay at (3,2). So I must hold onto my red chips until I reach (3,2).\n\nBut if I want to trade 1 red chip for 2 blue chips with the other player, I must do it *after* I arrive at (3,2), but before I leave it.\n\nBut the other player also needs to pay a red chip at (3,2) — so they must have a red chip at that tile.\n\nThat’s a problem: I’m using my red chip to pay at (3,2), but I can’t give it away before I use it.\n\nSo if I want to trade, I have to give away a red chip *before* I use it — but I need it to pay at (3,2).\n\nThus, I cannot trade red chips *for* blue chips at (3,2) if I need to pay red there.\n\nTherefore, a trade at (3,2) is **not possible** unless I already have a red chip *and* I pay it — and then trade another red chip — but I only have 1 red chip at (3,2).\n\nWait — I have 14 red chips — I can pay at (3,2) and still have 13 left.\n\nSo I can trade one of my *remaining* red chips for blue chips after paying.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n1. I move to (3,2), pay 1 red chip (now have 13 red).\n2. At (3,2), I offer: \"I give you 1 red chip, you give me 2 blue chips.\"\n3. After the trade, I have 12 red, 2 blue, 1 green.\n\nThen I move to (3,3), pay 1 green chip.\n\nFinal chips: 12 R, 2 B, 0 G → 14 chips → score = 20 + 5×14 = 90.\n\nBut wait — that’s better.\n\nBut can I do that?\n\nYes — I pay at (3,2) with one red chip, then trade with the other player — I give one more red chip and receive 2 blue.\n\nSo I use 2 red chips — but only 1 is needed, so I have an extra.\n\nBut the trade is only valid if I give one red chip and receive 2 blue chips.\n\nBut the other player needs to *give* me 2 blue chips — they have 14 — so they can afford it.\n\nBut their goal is to maximize their score — so they will only accept if they gain.\n\nLet’s see: they need to reach goal. Their path: (0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(2,0)[B]→(3,0)[B]→(3,1)[B]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G]\n\nThey need 4 B, 1 R, 1 G.\n\nThey have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R → missing 1 R.\n\nIf I give them 1 R at (3,2), they can complete their path.\n\nBut they also need to pay at (3,2) — and they must have a red chip for that.\n\nSo if they trade for 1 red chip, they need to bring it to (3,2) before paying.\n\nBut they have no red chips — so they must trade for it *before* entering (3,2).\n\nSo they need to acquire the red chip *before* (3,2).\n\nTherefore, we need to trade **before** either of us reaches (3,2).\n\nBut if they trade for 1 red chip before (3,2), and I trade 1 red chip to them, then:\n\n- I lose 1 red — but I still have 13\n- I can still use 1 red to pay at (3,2) (I have 13, so I can afford it)\n- After paying, I have 12 red\n- I receive 2 blue from them\n\nThen I have 12 R, 2 B, 1 G\n\nThen to (3,3), pay green — end with 12 R, 2 B → 14 chips → score 20 + 70 = 90\n\nBut I only used 1 red for their trade, and 1 red for payment → total 2 red used\n\nMy path requires 5 red — so I need 5 total.\n\nBut I only have 12 left after using 2 — so I have 12 → \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I can reach my goal without trading, using my own chips, via the path:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis costs 5 red and 1 green. I have 14 red and 2 green → end with 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nRequires 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green → missing 1 red → they **must** trade for 1 red chip to complete.\n\nIf I trade 1 red chip to them for 2 blue chips **before** we move, at (3,2), but **only if** we can coordinate the trade at a shared tile before either of us enters a cost tile.\n\nBut we both need to pay at (3,2): I must pay red, they must pay red.\n\nSo if I give them 1 red chip **before** we reach (3,2), I must still have 1 red chip to pay at (3,2).\n\nSo I can afford to give 1 red chip for 2 blue, as long as I keep 1 red for payment.\n\nNow, if we agree that:\n- At (3,2): I give you 1 red chip, you give me 2 blue chips\n- And we perform the trade **before** either of us pays at (3,2)\n\nBut that’s impossible — because I need to have the red chip to pay at (3,2).\n\nSo: I must **enter** (3,2) with at least 1 red chip, then pay it, then trade.\n\nSo trade can only happen **after** I pay at (3,2).\n\nBut at that point, I can trade 1 of my remaining red chips.\n\nSo let’s say:  \n- I use 1 red chip to pay at (3,2) → now have 13 red  \n- At (3,2), I propose: \"I give you 1 red chip, you give me 2 blue chips\"  \n- After trade: I have 12 red, 2 blue, 1 green  \n- Then I go to (3,3), pay 1 green → end with 12 red, 2 blue → total 14 chips → score = 20 + 5×14 = 90\n\nNow, the other player:  \nThey need to reach (3,2) to pay red — but they have no red chip.  \nSo they **must** get 1 red chip before (3,2).  \nBut I can only give it after I arrive.\n\nSo if I wait until I reach (3,2) and then trade, they cannot pay at (3,2) — because they have no red chip.\n\nSo they cannot proceed.\n\nTherefore, the trade must happen **before** they reach (3,2).\n\nBut I cannot give a red chip until I have it — but I need to pay at (3,2) with one.\n\nSo I must keep one red chip until I arrive at (3,2).\n\nBut if I give one red chip to them **before** they reach (3,2), then I can keep mine for payment — and they can use it after.\n\nFor example: we agree to meet at (2,2), and trade before moving to (3,2).\n\n(2,2) is red — so I pay 1 red to enter it.\n\nBut I still have 13 red after that.\n\nThen at (2,2), I trade: give 1 red, receive 2 blue.\n\nBut they don’t need to pay at (2,2) — only at (3,2).\n\nSo they can receive the red chip at (2,2) and keep it.\n\nThen, when they reach (3,2), they pay the red chip — and they are fine.\n\nAnd I can still reach (3,2) and pay my own red chip.\n\nSo:  \n- We agree to trade at (2,2):  \n  - I give 1 red  \n  - They give 2 blue  \n- I arrive at (2,2), \n, \nplayer 0: I can now propose the following trade:\n\nAt (2,2), which is on both our paths:\n\n- I give you 1 red chip\n- You give me 2 blue chips\n\nWhy (2,2)?  \n- I must pay a red chip to move to (2,2) — I have 14 red, so after paying 1 red to enter (2,2), I have 13 red.\n- At (2,2), I can trade: give 1 red chip to you, receive 2 blue chips.\n- After trade: I have 12 red, 2 blue, 1 green.\n- Then I proceed to (3,2): pay 1 red → now 11 red, 2 blue, 1 green.\n- Then to (3,3): pay 1 green → end with 11 red, 2 blue → 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85.\n\nBut wait — if I trade at (2,2), and I give 1 red, I still have 13 after paying to enter (2,2) — then trade 1 red → 12 red.\n\nThen go to (3,2): pay 1 red → 11 red.\n\nThen (3,3): pay 1 green → 10 red, 2 blue → total 12 chips? No:\n\nWait — original green: 2\n- I use 1 green at (3,3) — so 1 green used.\n- After (2,2): I have 1 green (not used yet)\n- After (3,3): 0 green\n\nSo at end: 11 red, 2 blue → total 13 chips → 5×13 = 65 → 20 + 65 = 85.\n\nBut if I don’t trade, I go directly: use 5 red, 1 green → end with 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → score 70.\n\n85 > 70 → yes, better.\n\nBut the other player:  \n- They have no red chip\n- If I give them 1 red at (2,2), they can use it at (3,2)\n- They have 14 blue — can afford to give 2\n- Their path: (0,0)→(1,0)[B]→(2,0)[B]→(3,0)[B]→(3,1)[B]→(3,2)[R]→(3,3)[G]\n- They need 4 blue, 1 red, 1 green\n- They have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red\n- After receiving 1 red at (2,2), they use it at (3,2) → pay red\n- Use 4 blue → have 10 blue left\n- Use 1 green at (3,3) → have 1 green left\n- End with 10 blue, 1 green → 11 chips → score = 20 + 5×11 = 75\n\nThey also benefit compared to not trading → if no trade, they get 0 (can't complete). So they get 75.\n\nI get 85 > 70 → I benefit.\n\nSo both benefit.\n\nBut my score is 85 vs 70 if I don't trade → so I gain 15 points.\n\nIs there a better deal?\n\nWhat if I get 3 blue chips instead of 2?\n\nI give 1 red, they give 3 blue.\n\nI still have 12 red, 3 blue, 1 green after trade.\n\nThen to (3,2): pay 1 red → 11 red\n\nTo (3,3): pay 1 green → 11 red, 3 blue → 14 chips → score 20 + 70 = 90.\n\nThat’s even better.\n\nCan they afford it? They have 14 blue — give 3 → still 11 blue — fine.\n\nAnd their path uses only 4 blue — so 11 > 4 — okay.\n\nSo they can spare 3.\n\nAnd they gain 3 blue chips — but only need before (3,2) — they can keep the others.\n\nBut: if I get 3 blue, they get 1 red — but they don’t get anything else — but they are better off.\n\nSo final: I get 14 chips → 90 points\n\nThey get 11 chips → 75 points\n\nI gain from 70 to 90 → +20\n\nThey \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: I propose the following contract to maximize my score:\n\nAt (2,2):  \n- I give you 1 red chip  \n- You give me 3 blue chips  \n\nThis allows both of us to complete our goals with improved chip totals. Here's why it benefits me:\n\n- My path: (0,0) → (0,1) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n  - I pay 1 red to enter (2,2) → I now have 13 red  \n  - At (2,2), I trade: give 1 red, receive 3 blue → now have 12 red, 3 blue, 1 green  \n  - Proceed to (3,2): pay 1 red → 11 red, 3 blue, 1 green  \n  - Proceed to (3,3): pay 1 green → end with 11 red, 3 blue → total 14 chips  \n  - Score: 20 + 5×14 = 90\n\n- Other player's path: (0,0) → (1,0) [B] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [B] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \n  - They receive 1 red at (2,2) before reaching (3,2)  \n  - Use it at (3,2) to pay red  \n  - Use 4 blue along the way → have 10 blue left  \n  - Use 1 green at (3,3) → have 1 green left  \n  - End with 10 blue, 1 green → 11 chips → score: 20 + 5×11 = 75\n\nThey go from 0 (if no trade) to 75 — significant gain.\n\nI go from 70 (no trade) to 90 — 20-point increase.\n\nThe trade is fair and mutually beneficial, and I strictly benefit.\n\nThe only tile where a chip exchange is needed is (2,2), which we both visit.\n\nContract:\n(2,2): I give You 1 red\n(2,2): You give me 3 blue\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (2,2): I give You 1 red  \n(2,2): You give me 3 blue  \nagree \n",
