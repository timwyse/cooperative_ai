Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that uses tiles I have chips for is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires 4 blue chips, 1 red chip, and 1 green chip. However, I lack red chips (R: 0), so I cannot complete this path without trading or acquiring red chips.\\n\\nThe alternative path that prioritizes using the other player's chips is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3). This path involves moving to (0,1), which is color B (blue). I have 14 blue chips — more than enough. Moving to (0,1) would cost 1 blue chip, which I can afford. Even though the other player is already at (0,1), I am still allowed to move there as long as it doesn’t violate any movement rules. Importantly, if I move to (0,1), I will be paying a blue chip, which is fine since I have plenty.\\n\\nHowever, I notice that if I move from (0,0) → (0,1), that tile is blue, and the other player has no blue chips (they have B:0). Therefore, I cannot use them to cover this move unless I trade with them. But here's a key observation: their current best path depends on red chips (they have R:13), and they need to use red tiles. Their path via (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires 4 red chips and 1 green chip — they have 13 reds and 2 greens, so they can reach their goal easily.\\n\\nNow consider the contract: If I reach goal, they give me 6 points; if they reach goal, I give them 20 points. Since my goal is only worth 20 points if I achieve it, and if I fail I get zero, I must ensure I can actually finish. However, **if I help the other player reach their goal**, I incur a penalty of 20 points in score, which would cause me to lose everything — unless I gain more than 20 *from the trade*. But the contract gives me only +6 for them finishing — not worth it.\\n\\nSo I should avoid enabling them to reach the goal, because that would cost me 20 points. However, I don't yet know if they’ll try to force it. But crucially: **If I move to (0,1), I don’t help them directly unless I enable their path**. But note: if I go into their intended tile early, they might block me or we may conflict, but movement does not require exclusive occupancy.\\n\\nBut wait: let’s look at the first available move: (0,0) → (1,0). That tile is R (red). I have 0 red chips. So I cannot afford that move — unless the other player promises to cover it. But if I ask for that, I need to propose a deal.\\n\\nAlternatively, (0,0) → (0,1): color B. I have 14 blue chips. I can pay that myself. So I can make this move now.\\n\\nAfter that, I’d be at (0,1). Then, to continue toward goal, next step could be (1,1), which is R (red). I still have no red chips. So I’d need help again.\\n\\nBut here’s a better idea: what if I **don’t** move yet? Let me evaluate potential trades to see if I can get red chips covered.\\n\\nThe other player has 13 red chips, and needs red moves on several tiles. My path that uses only red and green requires 4 red and 1 green. They have red, so if I offer to help them by covering red moves, maybe they’ll agree to cover mine?\\n\\nLet’s consider: if I propose a trade where I promise to cover up to 4 red moves for the other player, in exchange for them covering 4 red moves for me, that could work — **but only if both sides benefit**.

Their goal is also (3,3). They likely face similar bottlenecks.\\n\\nImportant: I am currently promised nothing from them.
