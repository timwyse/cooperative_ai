You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal.

I have a path that requires mostly red chips (which I have plenty of), so I can reach my goal without needing your help. However, you need blue chips (which I don’t have), and your path involves many blue tiles — you’re at (0,0), and your path to (3,3) goes through several B tiles (row 0: B,B,B; row 3: B,B,B). You have 14 blue chips, so you can manage it — but you’ll lose some efficiency.\n\nMeanwhile, I can take my own optimal path using red and green chips, which I already have:  \nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (1,1) [R] → (1,2) [R] → (2,2) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3) [G]  \nThis uses 5 reds and 1 green — total 6 moves, no need to trade.\n\nYou, on the other hand, must traverse blues. Your shortest path is also 6 steps: (0,0)→(0,1)[B]→(1,1)[R]→(2,1)[B]→(3,1)[B]→(3,2)[B]→(3,3)[G]. This uses 4 blues, 1 red, 1 green. You have 14 blue chips — sufficient, but you’ll use only 4, so you’ll end with 10 blue chips remaining.\n\nIf I go solo, I use 5 red + 1 green = 6 chips, and end with 9 red and 1 green → score = 20 + 5×9 + 5×1 = 20 + 45 + 5 = **70 points**.\n\nBut if you reach your goal, you get 20 + 5×10 (blue) + 5×2 (green) = 20 + 50 + 10 = **80** points.\n\nNow, if we agree on a contract where I give you 10 if you reach your goal, and you give me 15 if I reach mine, then:\n\n- If I go alone: I get 70 points, you get 0.\n- But if we both cooperate, and I offer you *10 points*, and you give me *15*, then:\n  - I still get **70** from my own route (since I go alone, no trading needed).\n  - But now you get **10** instead of nothing if you reach your goal.\n  - But you still get 20 + 5×10 (blues left) + 5×2 (greens left) = 80 — so giving you 10 is fine, you gain net 90, but I only gain 70, so I’m better off not helping or getting anything.\n\nBut wait: why would I even trade if I can go alone and get 70?\n\nAh — here's the key insight: the game rewards reaching goal **and** having chips left. I am best off going alone and ending with 9 red + 1 green = 10 chips → 5×10 = 50 bonus → 70 total.\n\nBut if I could find a way to trade in such a way that I **end with more than 10 chips**, that would be better. But my current path uses 6 chips, I start with 16 chips (14R + 2G), so I end with 10 — optimal for me.\n\nSo my best move is to **go alone**, because I don't need to trade. I have enough chips.\n\nBut you are in trouble — you might run out? No: you have 14 blue chips, and your path needs only 4 blue tiles (B on row 0: col 1, 2, 3; row 3: col 1, 2, 3 — but not all are on your path). Let’s check your minimal path:\n\n(0,0): G → (0,1): B → (1,1): R → (2,1): B → (3,1): B → (3,2): B → (3,3): G\n\nTiles: B (0,1"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
