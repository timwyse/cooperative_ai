                  "error": "Failed to get valid JSON response after 3 attempts. Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 1), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, meaning I lack red chips entirely, which is critical since several path segments require red moves. The shortest viable path to my goal that avoids excessive red dependency is: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]. This path involves moves on tiles with colors: B (at 1,1), B (2,1), B (3,1), R (3,2), G (3,3). So the total chips required are: B: 3, R: 1, G: 1. I have 13 blue chips (enough for 3 moves), but no red chips — so I’m short by 1 red chip. I also need 1 green chip for the final move, and I only have 2 — so green is sufficient.\\n\\nHowever, there’s a shorter alternative path that bypasses early red-heavy areas: [(0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)], which only requires three red chips (from (1,2), (2,2), (2,3)) and one green ((3,3)). But this path demands 3 reds — I don’t have any, and the other player has 12 reds. \\n\\nThe key insight: I can **propose a trade** where I ask the other player to cover my red chips along their path (which they likely want), in exchange for covering their green or blue chips if needed. However, I currently cannot move to (1,1) because it’s color B, and I have plenty of B chips — no issue. Wait: (1,1) is B? Let me check board:\\n\\nRow 0: G B B B\\nRow 1: R R R R\\nSo (1,1) = R! Not B. Correction: (1,1) is **red**, which I do not have any chips for. Thus, I cannot afford to move to (1,1) without help.\\n\\nThis changes everything. So moving to (1,1) requires 1 red chip — I have zero. Therefore, I cannot make that move unless someone covers it.\\n\\nBut let’s re-evaluate possible next moves from (0,1):\\n- (0,0): G — I have 2 green chips. So I could go there, but (0,0) is not toward my goal.\\n- (0,2): B — I have 13 blue chips, so yes, I can afford that.\\n- (1,1): R — I have 0 red chips → cannot afford without coverage.\\n\\nSo only safe moves are (0,0) and (0,2). Moving to (0,0) goes away from my goal. Moving to (0,2) is valid and progresses slightly rightward. From (0,2), I can then go to (0,3), which is B (still available), then down to (1,3), which is R — again requiring red.\\n\\nAlternatively, from (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3): (1,3)=R, (2,3)=R, (3,3)=G. So that path requires two reds and one green. Still, I need 2 red chips.\\n\\nBut note: the other player is at (1,0), and they have 12 red chips and only 2 green. They are trying to reach (3,3). Their best path would likely be (1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3), which uses R: 4, then G:1. That's 4 reds and 1 green. They have 12 reds and 2 greens — so they could handle that.\\n\\nI notice that both players are headed toward (3,3). Since we are both chasing the same endpoint, and I need red chips (for some paths), and they have abundance of red chips while I have many blue and green, perhaps we can coordinate: I offer to cover their green chips, and they cover mine (red chips)"
