The tile (2,0) is R (red). I have 1 R chip in my inventory. Moving to (2,0) requires 1 red chip — I have exactly 1, so I can afford it. After that, the next tile (3,0) is also R — I’ll need another red chip. I currently have only 1 red chip, so after this move, I’ll have 0 red chips. But I do have 12 blue and 2 green chips. The path (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires: R (2), B (1), G (1) — from (2,0)→(3,0): R, (3,0)→(3,1): B, (3,1)→(3,2): B, (3,2)→(3,3): G.

They have no incentive to trade since they've already finished, and I can't move without red. So I propose a trade: offer 2 blue chips (I have 12) to get 1 red chip. That would give me 1 red chip, enabling me to move to (3, 0) or (2, 1). This is worth doing because otherwise I’m frozen.\n\nEven if I get only one red chip, I can then start moving. Once I start, I may be able to continue the path using my own blue/green chips later — but I still need red for (3,0) and (2,1), etc.\n\nBut critically: if I don't trade, I never move → I never reach goal → 0 points. If I trade and then move toward goal, I might reach goal and get 20 + 5 × (remaining chips). Even after trading 2 blue for 1 red, I’ll have 10 blue and 1 red and 2 green = 13 chips remaining if I go all the way. That gives me 20 + 5×13 = 85 points, much better than 0.\n\nSo yes — trading now is necessary. I can't move yet without red. So I must stay put and propose a trade to get 1 red chip (by offering 2 blue). I do not want to move now, but I *must* initiate a trade to make progress.\n\nTherefore, I do **not** move yet. I instead use this turn to propose a trade to acquire the red chip I need.",
