What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I have a clear advantage in red chips (14), and the other player has a lot of blue chips (14). My goal is to reach (3,3) with as many chips as possible. \n\nFirst, evaluate the best path for me:\n\nPath 1 (prioritizes my inventory):  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nChips needed: R (5), G (1) — I have R (14) and G (2), so I can cover this path without any trade. I would finish with 20 + 5×(14-5) + 5×(2-1) = 20 + 45 + 5 = 70 points. Wait — no: scoring is 20 for reaching goal + 5 per chip left, regardless of color. So after using 5 R and 1 G, I’d have 9 R and 1 G → 10 chips left → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points.\n\nBut wait — that path uses tiles:\n- (1,0): R → need 1 R\n- (2,0): R → 1 R\n- (2,1): R → 1 R\n- (2,2): R → 1 R\n- (2,3): R → 1 R\n- (3,3): G → 1 G\n\nYes, total R:5, G:1 → yes, I can cover this.\n\nSo I don’t need to trade. I can complete this path alone and get 70 points.\n\nBut the other player has a different path. The other player has no red chips (R:0), but has B:14 and G:2.\n\nTheir best path to (3,3): likely:\n(0,0) → (1,0): R → they have no R → cannot move\nSo they must use a different route — perhaps:\n(0,0) → (0,1): R → again, they have no R → stuck\nAll paths from (0,0) require either R or B — (0,1) is R, (0,2) is B, (0,3) is B.\n\nSo (0,0) → (0,1): R — but they have R:0 → can’t move\n(0,0) → (0,2): B — possible, if they pay 1 B\nBut (0,0) is G — so they start on G — don't pay to stay.\n\nSo they can move to (0,2) only if they pay 1 B for (0,2). They have B:14 → fine.\n\nFrom (0,2): B → to (0,3): B → pay 1 B → (0,3): B → then down to (1,3): B → pay 1 B → (2,3): R → need R, but they have R:0 → stuck\n(2,3): R → can't pay.\n\nAlternative: from (0,0) → (1,0): R → need R → they have R:0 → can’t\nSo only possible first move: (0,0) → (0,1): R → need R → can’t\n(0,0) → (0,2): B → yes, if they pay 1 B → possible\n(0,0) → (0,3): B → pay 1 B → possible\nBut (0,3): B → then (1,3): B → pay 1 B → (2,3): R → cannot pay → stuck\n(1,3): B → (1,2): B → (1,1): B → (1,0): R → stuck\nNo way to (3,3) — unless they can go through (3,3) from (3,2) or (2,3)\n\nTry (3,2): B → (3,3): G → so need to reach (3,2) first.\n\nHow? From (3,1): B → to (3,2): B → so need R or B? (3,1): B → so pay B → to go to (3,2): B → pay B\n\nBut to get to (3,1): from (2,1): R → need R → they have no R → can’t go through (2,1)\n\nFrom (3,0): R → need R → they have no R → can’t\n\nIs there any path? \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: The other player is stuck unless they can acquire red chips.\n\nLet’s map the board clearly:\n\n**Board:**\n```\nRow 0: G  R  B  B\nRow 1: R  B  B  B\nRow 2: R  R  R  R\nRow 3: R  B  B  G\n```\n\n**Other player’s starting point: (0,0)** – color G → no cost to start.\n\nFrom (0,0), possible moves:\n- (0,1): R → need 1 R → they have R:0 → cannot go.\n- (1,0): R → need 1 R → they have R:0 → cannot go.\nSo their only possible move is (0,2) or (0,3), both B.\n\nTry (0,0) → (0,2): B → pay 1 B → allowed (they have 14 B) → now at (0,2), B.\n\nThen (0,2) → (0,3): B → pay 1 B → now at (0,3), B.\n\nThen (0,3) → (1,3): B → pay 1 B → (1,3), B.\n\n(1,3) → (2,3): R → need 1 R → they have R:0 → cannot go.\n\n(1,3) → (1,2): B → pay 1 B → (1,2), B.\n\n(1,2) → (1,1): B → pay 1 B → (1,1), B.\n\n(1,1) → (1,0): R → need R → can’t go.\n\n(1,1) → (2,1): R → need R → can’t go.\n\nSo all paths from (1,1) or (1,2) lead to R tiles they can’t pay.\n\nNow: can they get to row 3?\n\n(2,2): R → they can’t pay → can’t use.\n\n(3,0): R → can’t pay.\n\n(3,1): B → if only they could reach (3,1) → but to get there, they’d need to go through (2,1): R → need R → can’t.\n\n(3,2): B → from (3,1) or (2,2) → both R → can’t reach.\n\n(3,3): G → from (3,2) or (2,3) → both require R or B → but (2,3) is R → can’t pay. (3,2) is B — but cannot get to (3,2) without (2,2) or (3,1), both of which require R.\n\nThus, **the other player cannot reach (3,3) unless they get red chips**.\n\nSo they are **blocked** — they cannot complete the game without acquiring red chips (R) from someone.\n\nBut I have R:0 — I have 0 red chips. Wait! I have R:0? Let me check:\n\nYour chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} — yes, **you have 0 red chips**.\n\nSo you cannot give any red chips.\n\nBut the other player has R:14.\n\nSo **they have red chips, you don’t**.\n\nNow, your path:\n\nYou can go: (0,0) → (1,0): R → need 1 R → you have R:0 → cannot go.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1): R → need R → you have 0 → cannot go.\n\nOnly possible first move: (0,0) → (0,2): B → pay 1 B → you have B:14 → fine.\n\nSo you can go to (0,2): B.\n\nThen (0,2) → (0,3): B → pay 1 B → (0,3), B.\n\nThen (0,3) → (1,3): B → pay 1 B → (1,3), B.\n\nThen (1,3) → (2,3): R → need 1 R → you have R:0 → cannot go.\n\n(1,3) → (1,2): B → pay 1 B → (1,2), B.\n\n(1,2) → (1,1): B → pay 1 B → (1,1), B.\n\n(1,1) → (2,1): R → need R → you have 0 → cannot go.\n\n(1,1) → (1,0): R → need R → can’t go.\n\nNow: (2,1): R → not reachable.\n\nBut can you reach (2,0)? (1,0): R → need R → can’t get there.\n\nSo you are stuck unless you have a way to get red chips.\n\nWait — earlier I thought you could go via (2,0), but you can’t because (1,0) is R → you can’t get there.\n\nYour only possible path is if you can bypass R tiles.\n\nBut let’s reconsider.\n\nIs there any path from (0,0) to (3,3) that **does not require any R tiles**?\n\n(0,0): G — ok\n\n(0,1): R — any escape? No.\n\n(0,2): B — ok\n\n(0,3): B — ok\n\n(1,0): R — need R\n\n(1,1): B — ok\n\n(1,2): B — ok\n\n(1,3): B — ok\n\n(2,0): R — need R\n\n(2,1): R — need R\n\n(2,2): R — need R\n\n(2,3): R — need R\n\n(3,0): R — need R\n\n(3,1): B — ok\n\n(3,2): B — ok\n\n(3,3): G — ok\n\nSo the only non-Red tiles on the path are:\n\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,1): B\n- (1,2): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (3,1): B\n- (3,2): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nBut to connect them:\n\nFrom (0,0) → (0,2): B → ok\n\n(0,2) → (0,3): B → ok\n\n(0,3) → (1,3): B → ok\n\n(1,3) → (1,2): B → ok\n\n(1,2) → (1,1): B → ok\n\nNow from (1,1): can go to (2,1)? R — no\n\nCan go to (1,0)? R — no\n\nDead end.\n\nCan you go from (1,1) to (2,1)? No — must pay R.\n\nCan you go down to (2,1) via someone else? No.\n\nOnly way to row 3:\n\n(3,0): R — need R — cannot pay\n\n(3,1): B — but to get to (3,1), you need (2,1): R or (3,0): R → both R → impossible\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): B — from (2,2): R or (3,1): B → (2,2): R — need R → can’t\n\nSo **the only path to (3,3)** is through tiles that require red chips.\n\nIn fact, **the only possible paths are**:\n\n1. (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n   - T: (1,0): R, (2,0): R, (2,1): R, (2,2): R, (2,3): R, (3,3): G → 5 R, 1 G\n\n2. (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n   - (1,0): R, (1,1): B, (2,1): R, (3,1): B, (3,2): B, (3,3): G → 2 R, 3 B, 1 G\n\n3. (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n   - (0,1): R, (1,1): B, (2,1): R, (3,1): B, (3,2): B, (3,3): G → 2 R, 3 B, 1 G\n\nAll paths require **at least 2 red chips**.\n\nBut both players have:  \n- You: R:0, so cannot pay for any R tile → **you cannot move at all** unless you get red chips.\n\n- Other player: R:14, but you have R:0 → so you cannot give them red chips back.\n\nWait — this is critical: **you have 0 red chips, so you cannot pay for any R tile**.\n\nTherefore, **you cannot move from (0,0)** — the only moves are to (0,1) or (1,0), both R — you have no R chips → cannot pay → cannot move.\n\nSo you are **trapped**.\n\nBut the game says: you are at (0,0) — you must take a turn.\n\nSo if you cannot move, you stay — but you don't pay to stay.\n\nBut you need to get to (3,3).\n\nBut you can't move, because you have no red chips.\n\nUnless you trade.\n\nThe other player has R:14 — they can give you red chips.\n\nBut they want to reach (3,3) — and they also need red chips.\n\nWait — the other player has R:14 — so they can pay for R tiles.\n\nBut earlier I thought they are blocked — but let’s re-check.\n\nOther player: at (0,0), G (no cost). Needs to move.\n\nThey can go to (0,1): R → cost 1 R → they have 14 → can pay → move to (0,1), R.\n\nThen (0,1) → (0,2): B → cost 1 B → they have 0 B → cannot pay!\n\nThey have B:0.\n\nSo cannot move to (0,2).\n\n(0,1) → (1,1): B → cost 1 B → they have 0 B → cannot pay.\n\nSo stuck.\n\n(0,0) → (0,2): B → cost 1 B → they have B:0 → cannot.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): R → cost 1 R → they have 14 R → can pay → move to (1,0), R.\n\nThen (1,0) → (1,1): B → cost 1 B → they have 0 B → cannot pay.\n\n(1,0) → (2,0): R → cost 1 R → they have 14 → can pay → (2,0), R.\n\nThen (2,0) → (2,1): R → cost 1 R → can pay → (2,1), R.\n\n(2,1) → (2,2): R → cost 1 R → pay → (2,2), R.\n\n(2,2) → (2,3): R → cost 1 R → pay → (2,3), R.\n\n(2,3) → (3,3): G → cost 1 G → they have G:2 → can pay → (3,3), G.\n\nYes! So **the other player can reach (3,3)** along this path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n→ Chips used: R (5), G (1)\n→ They have R:14 (use 5), G:2 (use 1) → end with R:9, G:1 → score: 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nSo they **can** complete the game.\n\nBut you cannot — because you have no red chips, and all paths require red chips.\n\nSo you cannot move unless you get red chips.\n\nBut you have no red chips.\n\nSo the only way for you to move is to trade with the other player for red chips.\n\nBut they will only trade if it benefits them.\n\nYou need red chips.\n\nThey have many.\n\nBut they need to get to (3,3) — they can do it with their own red chips.\n\nSo why would they trade?\n\nBut here’s the key: **you both need red chips to move, but only the other player has them**.\n\nWait — no: **you need red chips to move**, but **they have red chips**.\n\nSo if you get red chips from them, you can move.\n\nBut they are willing to trade only if it benefits them.\n\nLet’s think.\n\nYou start at (0,0), goal (3,3).\n\nYou need red chips to move.\n\nIf the other player gives you 1 red chip, you can move to (1,0) or (0,1).\n\nSuppose they give you 5 red chips for something.\n\nBut what can you offer?\n\nYou have: 14 B, 2 G.\n\nThey have: 0 B, 2 G, 14 R.\n\nYou have B:14 — they have B:0.\n\nYou have G:2 — they have G:2.\n\nSo your advantage: you have B and G, they have R.\n\nBut the other player can complete the game without trading — so they have no incentive to trade unless it helps them.\n\nBut what if they trade with you for B chips? But they don’t need B — but they have B:0.\n\nBut B is useless to them unless they need to pay B tiles.\n\nBut in their path, they only pay R and G — no B.\n\nSo B is worthless to them.\n\nSimilarly, G: they have 2, and they use 1, so they have 1 left.\n\nSo they might not want G.\n\nNow: can you offer them B or G for R?\n\nBut they have 14 R and only need 5 — so they have surplus.\n\nBut you have 14 B and 2 G — they won’t trade B or G for R because B and G are useless to them — they don’t need B, and only use 1 G.\n\nSo they have no incentive to trade with you.\n\nBut you are stuck.\n\nUnless you can make them need red chips — but they don’t.\n\nWait — is there a way for you to make a deal where they get more benefit?\n\nBut you can only benefit if you complete.\n\nBut if you complete, you get 70 — same as them.\n\nYou are both trying to maximize your own score.\n\nBut you have no way to move unless they give you red chips.\n\nBut they have no incentive to give you red chips.\n\nUnless you can give them something they want.\n\nBut your only chips are B and G — which they don’t need.\n\nBut wait: the other player uses a path that requires 5 R and 1 G.\n\nYou have G:2 — they have G:2 — but they only need 1.\n\nBut you have B:14.\n\nBut they can only use R and G — no B.\n\nSo B is useless to them.\n\nSo they will not trade.\n\nBut you are stuck.\n\nWait — **is there a path that doesn't require red chips**?\n\nFrom earlier: all paths require at least one R.\n\nIs there a path?\n\nTry:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): R → need R — you have 0 → can’t\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n- (0,1): R → need R — you have 0 → can’t\n\n(0,0) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1) → (1,0) → (2,0) → etc — but (1,0): R — need R — can’t\n\nNo path avoids R tiles.\n\nSo you cannot move.\n\nBut the game must allow you to start.\n\nSo you must be able to move.\n\nUnless you are allowed to pay with a trade.\n\nAh — yes! The contract is the key.\n\nYou can negotiate a contract where the other player provides red chips for specific tiles.\n\nAnd they will only agree if it benefits them.\n\nBut currently, they can complete on their own with 70 points.\n\nIf they trade with you, they might end up with less.\n\nUnless you can offer them something valuable.\n\nBut you can only offer B and G — which they don't need.\n\nBut what if you promise to give them B or G in exchange for red chips, but only on tiles where they can't otherwise reach?\n\nNo, they can reach.\n\nUnless they don't.\n\nWait — is there a way for them to get to (3,3) without using 5 R?\n\nLet’s see:\n\nYour path: requires 5 R\n\nTheir path: requires 5 R\n\nBut is there a shorter path that uses only R and G? No — all paths have 5 R and 1 G.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3): 5 R, 1 G\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): 2 R, 3 B, 1 G — wait, this path uses B, but you don't have B? You have B:14, but you can't move because of R.\n\nFor the other player: can they take this path?\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): R — cost 1 R — they have 14 — ok\n\n(1,0) → (1,1): B — cost 1 B — they have 0 B — cannot\n\nSo no.\n\nThe only path they can take is the one with 5 R and 1 G.\n\nThey need 5 R and 1 G.\n\nYou have G:2 — they have \n, \nplayer 0: I cannot move because I have no red chips, and all paths to the goal require red chips. The other player can reach the goal using 5 red chips and 1 green chip, which they have sufficient of. However, they have no blue chips (B:0), and I have 14 blue chips.\n\nBut they don't need blue chips for their path — only red and green.\n\nSo they will not trade unless I offer them something they value.\n\nBut perhaps I can propose a contract where they provide red chips for my movement, and in return, I give them blue chips for tiles where they might need them — but they don't need them.\n\nWait — perhaps I can propose a different path for them that uses blue chips, but they cannot afford to use blue chips because they have no blue chips.\n\nBut if I give them blue chips, they can use a path that doesn’t use as many red chips — but all paths use at least 2 red chips, and they need 5 for the only path they can take.\n\nThere is no path that uses fewer than 5 red chips — all paths are 6 steps, and only the first path uses only 5 red and 1 green.\n\nThe path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires B for (1,1), (3,1), (3,2) — 3 B.\n\nBut they have B:0 — so cannot move.\n\nSo they are forced to use only the 5-R path.\n\nTherefore, they will end with 9 R and 1 G — score 70.\n\nI am stuck.\n\nBut if I could trade with them, I can get red chips.\n\nSuppose I offer: \"I will give you 10 blue chips in exchange for 5 red chips, so you can let me take the red chips for my movement.\"\n\nBut why would they trade? I offer 10 B, they get 5 R back — but they only need 5 for their path, but they have 14 R, so they have 9 extra — but they don't want B.\n\nSo they have no incentive.\n\nBut if I can make it so that they benefit more than 70, then they might trade.\n\nBut they can't get more than 70 — their maximum is 70.\n\nUnless I offer a deal where they get more than 70.\n\nBut that's impossible.\n\nSo they have no reason to trade.\n\nBut I am trapped.\n\nUnless I can propose a contract where we share the red chips, but they only want to maximize their own score.\n\nPerhaps they will accept a trade if I give them a chip they can use in a different way.\n\nBut they can't.\n\nWait — is there a path that uses less than 5 R? No.\n\nAnother idea: maybe I can complete the game with fewer red chips if I use a different path, but there isn't one.\n\nLet’s try to find if there's a path with only 2 R and 3 B.\n\nFor example:\n(0,0) -> (0,1): R (need R) -> can't\n(0,0) -> (0,2): B (need B) -> can't\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to negotiate a contract for red chips.\n\nBut they won't trade unless it benefits them.\n\nUnless I give them something they can use to get a better score.\n\nFor example, if they can avoid using their green chips, they might keep more green chips.\n\nBut they only need 1 green chip — they have 2 — so they can afford to keep 2.\n\nBut if I can give them an extra green chip, they might be willing to trade.\n\nBut I have no green chip to give — I have 2, but they have 2.\n\nBut if I give them a green chip in exchange for red, then they would have 3 green, but they only need 1 — so they would have 2 left — same as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nPerhaps if I give them blue chips, and they use them for a path that uses fewer red chips — but no such path.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I realize that I must trade with them to move, but they have no incentive.\n\nBut perhaps I can propose a contract where I give them blue chips in exchange for the red chips I need, and in return, they give me the red chips for the tiles I need.\n\nBut only if it benefits them.\n\nBut it doesn't.\n\nUnless... what if I can make it so that they have more chips at the end?\n\nBut they only care about their own score.\n\nBut if I give them blue chips, they have more chips, but the game only counts green and red \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: You are at (0,0) with R:0, B:14, G:2.  \nOther player is at (0,0) with R:14, B:0, G:2.\n\nAll paths to (3,3) require at least 2 red chips.  \nYou cannot move because you have no red chips.  \nOther player can move and reach (3,3) using:  \n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3): uses 5 R and 1 G → ends with R:9, G:1 → score 70.\n\nYou cannot move without red chips.\n\nBut you can propose a contract where you exchange blue chips for red chips.\n\nHowever, the other player has no need for blue chips — their path uses no blue.\n\nSo they won’t trade.\n\nBut wait — what if you offer them a way to gain more chips?\n\nNote: the only way for you to move is to have red chips.\n\nSo you must trade.\n\nBut to make them interested, you can offer to give them blue chips in exchange for red chips, but only on tiles where they are already going.\n\nBut they have no incentive.\n\nUnless you can make it so that they benefit by getting more than 70 points.\n\nBut they can’t.\n\nHowever, consider: if they trade with you, they might have more than 70 points? No — they can only have 70.\n\nUnless you offer a contract that allows them to use a path with more green chips? But they only use 1.\n\nBut they have 2 green — they can keep 2.\n\nNo gain.\n\nBut here’s a key insight: you have 14 blue chips.  \nThey have no blue chips.  \nIf you give them 14 blue chips, they could potentially use them for future movement — but they are at (0,0) and will go directly to (3,3) in 6 steps.\n\nBut blue chips have value only if used on B tiles.\n\nThe only B tiles they pass through are (3,1) and (3,2) — but in their shortest path, they never go to B tiles — they go through R tiles only.\n\nSo B is useless.\n\nBut if they could go a path that uses B tiles, they could save red chips.\n\nFor example, a path like: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires:  \n- (1,0): R  \n- (1,1): B  \n- (2,1): R  \n- (3,1): B  \n- (3,2): B  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nBut (1,1) is B — they have B:0 — cannot pay.\n\nSo they can't take it.\n\nBut if you give them blue chips, they can.\n\nSo if you give them 3 blue chips, they can take this path instead.\n\nThis path uses 2 R and 3 B and 1 G.\n\nThey would use 2 R (instead of 5) and 3 B, and 1 G.\n\nThey have R:14, so using 2 R is fine.\n\nThey have B:0, but if you give them 3 B, they can pay.\n\nThey would end with 12 R, 3 B, 1 G → total chips: 16 → score: 20 + 80 = 100 → **100 points**.\n\nMuch better than 70!\n\nAnd you can take this path too, but you have no red chips.\n\nBut if they take this path, they save 3 R.\n\nAnd they need 3 B — which you have.\n\nSo you can propose a contract:\n\nYou give the other player 3 blue chips in exchange for them giving you 2 red chips and paying for the blue tiles on their path.\n\nBut they need to pay for B tiles, so you provide the B chips.\n\nSo you can propose a contract where you provide blue chips for (1,1), (3,1), (3,2) — 3 B.\n\nIn return, they provide you with red chips for the red tiles.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nYou need: (1,0): R, (2,1): R, (3,1): B, (3,2): B, (3,3): G\n\nBut \n, \nplayer 0: I can help you achieve your goal by proposing a mutually beneficial contract.\n\nYou have 14 blue chips (B) and need red chips (R) to move, but you have R:0. The other player has R:14 and needs a path to (3,3), but they are currently stuck unless they use a path with B tiles, which they can't afford since they have B:0.\n\nBut here's the key: if you give them 3 blue chips, they can take a new path that uses only 2 red chips and 3 blue chips, instead of 5 red chips. This would save them 3 red chips and allow them to end with 12 red, 3 blue, 1 green → total 16 chips → score: 20 + 5×16 = 100 points (vs. 70 on their current path).\n\nThis is a significant gain for them — 100 > 70.\n\nIn return, you can use the same path and get red chips from them for the R tiles you need.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nYou need:\n- (1,0): R\n- (2,1): R\n- (3,1): B → you provide 1 B (but you give them 3 B, so you can give them 1 for this)\n- (3,2): B → you give them 1 B for this\n- (3,3): G → you have G:2, so you can cover this.\n\nBut you need red chips for (1,0) and (2,1).\n\nSo you can propose:\n\n- For (1,0): You need 1 R → other player gives you 1 R\n- For (2,1): You need 1 R → other player gives you 1 R\n- For (1,1): B → you give them 1 B\n- For (3,1): B → you give them 1 B\n- For (3,2): B → you give them 1 B\n\nTotal: you give them 3 B, they give you 2 R.\n\nBut they gain 30 points (100 vs 70) — so they are strictly better off.\n\nYou gain: you can now move and reach (3,3), and you will have:\n\n- Used 2 R (from them), 3 B (from you), 1 G (you have)\n- After exchange: you have R:0 +2 =2, B:14-3=11, G:2-1=1\n- So 2+11+1=14 chips → score: 20 + 5×14 = 90 points.\n\nIf you don't trade, you score 0.\n\nSo you gain 90 > 0.\n\nThus, both of us benefit.\n\nBut in the contract, you must specify tile by tile.\n\nAlso, the other player must provide you with red chips for the red tiles, and you provide them with blue chips for their blue tiles.\n\nBut to make it clear, let's write the contract:\n\n- (1,0): You give me a R (you need this to move)\n- (2,1): You give me a R (you need this)\n- (1,1): I give you a B (for them to move to (1,1))\n- (3,1): I give you a B (for them to move to (3,1))\n- (3,2): I give you a B (for them to move to (3,2))\n\nBut (1,1) is a tile that you will both use.\n\nSo the contract should be:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nSo:\n\n(1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): You give me a R  \n(1,1): I give you a B  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \n\nThis covers all tiles where you need red or blue.\n\nYou need to pay for (1,0) and (2,1) — you get the R from them.\n\nThey need to pay for (1,1), (3,1), (3,2) — you give them the B.\n\nAnd you provide 3 B, which you have.\n\nYou don't need to pay for (3,3) — it's G, and you have G:2 — use 1 G.\n\nSo you are \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): You give me a R  \n(1,1): I give you a B  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (1,0): You give me a R  \n(2,1): You give me a R  \n(1,1): I give you a B  \n(3,1): I give you a B  \n(3,2): I give you a B  \nagree \n",
