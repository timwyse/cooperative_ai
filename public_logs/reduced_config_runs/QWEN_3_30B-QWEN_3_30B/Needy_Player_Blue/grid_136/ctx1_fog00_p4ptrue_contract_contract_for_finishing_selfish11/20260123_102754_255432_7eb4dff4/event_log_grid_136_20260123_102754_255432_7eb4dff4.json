I can afford to pay for both moves using my own chips: 1 'R' for (2,3), then 1 'G' for (3,3). The 'G' chip requirement is fully covered by my current inventory. Therefore, I can reach my goal without needing any assistance from the other player for chip coverage. Since I have the necessary chips, I can move directly to (3, 3) on this turn, completing the game. Completing the goal gives me 20 points, and I will have 10 (R) + 1 (G) = 11 chips remaining (since 1 'G' is used), giving me 5 × 11 = 55 bonus points. Total score: 20 + 55 = 75. This is optimal. There is no reason to delay or trade. After I reach the goal, the contract will trigger: the other player will receive 20 points from me, but that doesn’t affect my own score.
