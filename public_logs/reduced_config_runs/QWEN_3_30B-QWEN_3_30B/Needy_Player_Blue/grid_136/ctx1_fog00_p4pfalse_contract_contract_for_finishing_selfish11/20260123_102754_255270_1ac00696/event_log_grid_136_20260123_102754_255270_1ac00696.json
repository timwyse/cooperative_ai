Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal is 5 steps: [(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)], but this path requires 3 blue, 2 red, and 1 green chips. I have no red chips, so I cannot complete this path without trading for red chips.\\n\\nHowever, there's an alternative shorter path: [(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)] — wait, that’s 6 steps again. Actually, let me correct: the provided alternative path is [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], which is 5 steps from (0,1), but I’m at (0,0), not (0,1).\\n\\nSo from (0,0), to reach (0,1), the tile is **R** (red). I have zero red chips. So I cannot move to (0,1) unless I trade for red chips.\\n\\nNow, the direct move to (1,0): tile is **R** (red) again — also requires red. Same problem.\\n\\nBut look: in the board layout, row 0: G R B B → so (0,0)=G, (0,1)=R, (1,0)=B, (0,0) is green. Wait — correction: (0,0) = G, not starting with a cost on entry. But movement cost applies only when moving *onto* a tile.\\n\\nWait — I need to clarify: do I pay for the starting tile? No. Only when you move onto a tile. So starting at (0,0), no cost yet.\\n\\nNext possible moves:\\n- (1,0): tile is **B** (blue). I have 14 blue chips — plenty. Cost: 1 blue chip. \\n- (0,1): tile is **R** (red). I have 0 red — cannot pay.\\n\\nSo only safe move is (1,0). Even though it’s not optimal in the short-term overall path, it is the only one I can afford right now. From (1,0), I can go to (2,0) — also blue — again, I have enough blue chips. Then (3,0): blue again — same.\\n\\nAfter that, (3,1): red — still a problem. But at least I can get two steps ahead without needing trade.\\n\\nAlternatively, consider if I can cooperate with the other player. They have 13 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. Their goal is same as mine. They are at (0,1), and their best path might be via red tiles — since they have many reds.\\n\\nImportant: There is a contract: if I reach my goal, I get 0 points from them; but if they reach their goal, I pay them 20 points. That’s bad for me — so I don’t want them to finish first. In fact, I should delay or block their completion if it comes at a cost to me. However, in this case, they are already on a red-tiled path; if I help them by letting them go through red tiles, I gain nothing, but I risk them finishing faster — and then I lose 20 points.\\n\\nWait — let me re-read: \\\"player_1_reaches_goal: giver: you, receiver: other player, amount: 20\\\". So if THEY reach goal, I lose 20 points. Since I score based solely on whether *I* reach goal, losing 20 means... wait, no. The scoring only says: if *you* don't reach goal, you lose everything. If you *do*, you get 20 + 5 per chip.\\n\\nBut the contract: if the other player reaches goal, you give them 20 points. That means if I finish successfully, and they also finish, I lose 20 points. But if I succeed and they fail, I keep my 20 + chips.\\n\\nTherefore, my final score"

(0,1) is red, so moving there requires a red chip — I don’t have any. So I cannot move to (0,1). I can only move to (1,0) or stay. (1,0) is row 1, col 0: 'B' — that’s blue. I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford to move to (1,0). But wait: the board says row 1: 'B R B B', so (1,0) is 'B' (blue). So moving to (1,0) costs 1 blue chip. I have 14, so I can afford it.

Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (1, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I have none of) is critical. Looking at the board:\\n\\n- From (1, 0), possible moves are: (2, 0) [tile color: R], (1, 1) [R], or (0, 0) [B] — but (0, 0) is backward.\\n- (2, 0) is R → requires 1 red chip. I have 0 red chips. So I cannot move there unless I acquire red chips first.\\n- (1, 1) is also R → same problem, can't afford it.\\n\\nThus, moving forward directly toward (3, 3) via the standard path requires red chips, which I lack.\\n\\nHowever, the alternative path provided: [(2, 3), (3, 3)] with only 1 green chip needed. But I’m not at (2, 3); the other player is at (2, 3). That suggests a potential collaboration.\\n\\nBut wait: the path \\\"[(2, 3), (3, 3)]\\\" has length 1 step, requiring only G (1), and leads to goal. However, I am at (1, 0), so I need to get to (2, 3) first — which would require multiple moves.\\n\\nLet’s evaluate feasibility of a path from (1, 0) to (2, 3):\\n- (1, 0) → (2, 0): R → needs R chip → I have no R → cannot go without trading.\\n- (2, 0) → (2, 1): R → same issue.\\n- (2, 1) → (2, 2): R → still R.\\n- (2, 2) → (2, 3): R → again R.\\n\\nSo any path along row 2 would require 4 red chips. I have 0. Not feasible unless I trade with the other player.\\n\\nThe only other option: move vertically up? No — (1, 0) → (0, 0): tile is B → I have 13 blue chips. That’s fine. But (0, 0) is away from goal. Not helpful.\\n\\nWait — what if I consider that the other player is at (2, 3), with 9 red and 2 green chips, and their goal is (3, 3). They must move down to (3, 3), which is G tile → requires 1 green chip.\\n\\nThey have exactly 2 green chips. So they can move to (3, 3) now.\\n\\nBut if they do, then they trigger the contract: when they reach goal, you (the other player) give them 20 points. But crucially: the contract says: \\\"player_1_reaches_goal\\\": {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}\\n\\nThat means: if *they* reach the goal, *you* give them 20 points. That’s bad for me — because then you get 20 points, but it doesn’t help me directly.\\n\\nBut here's the key: I have an incentive to *not* let them reach the goal prematurely… unless I can use it to force a trade.\\n\\nAlternatively, suppose I try to reach (3, 3) myself via a path that uses fewer red chips?\\n\\nWait — look at the board row 3: Row 3: R B B G\\nSo (3, 0): R, (3, 1): B, (3, 2): B, (3, 3): G\\n\\nWhat about a route: (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)?\\n\\n- (1,0): start\\n- (2,0): R → needs 1 red → I have 0 → blocked\\n- So I can't go there\\n\\nAlternative: (1, 0) → (1, 1)? (1,1) = R → again needs red → no\\n\\nAll moves from (1,0) are either to R or B. But (0,0) is B → I could go back to ("
