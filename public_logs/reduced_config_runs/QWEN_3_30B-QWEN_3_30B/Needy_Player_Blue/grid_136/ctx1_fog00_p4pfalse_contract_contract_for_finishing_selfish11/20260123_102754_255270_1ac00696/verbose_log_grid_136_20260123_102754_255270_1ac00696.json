Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I notice that you are at (0, 0) with goal (3, 3), just like me. We both need to reach the same destination.\n\nMy path requires: 5 red chips and 1 green chip (total 6 steps). I currently have 14 red and 2 green — so I can cover this path without trading. I don’t need your chips.\n\nYour path (from my view) requires: 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green. You have 14 blue, 2 green, but **0 red**. So you are missing red chips, which are critical — especially on the path you’d take: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). That path requires 2 red chips at tiles (3,1) and (3,2) — but you have zero red.\n\nYou **cannot** complete that path without red chips. But **I** can.\n\nSo here’s the negotiation positioning:\n\n- I can reach my goal **without any trade**, using only my own chips.\n- You **cannot** reach your goal **without a trade**, because you lack red chips.\n\nTherefore, **you need me**, not the other way around.\n\nThus, I will propose a contract where I will **only help you if you give me 20 points if you reach your goal** — because I gain nothing from helping you unless you pay me fully. But I already have a path to my goal, so I don’t need you.\n\nBut here's the catch: I can get *more* chips by helping you. Why? Because if we both reach our goals:\n\n- I get 20 + (remaining chips) = 20 + 14 red + 2 green − 5 red − 1 green = 20 + 8 red + 1 green = 20 + 9 = 29 points.\n- You get 20 + (your chips) = 20 + 14 blue + 2 green − 3 blue − 2 red − 1 green → but you don’t have red! So you’d need to buy 2 reds from me.\n\nAh — so if we trade reds to you, you can complete your path. And if I do, I’ll get some benefit: you’ll pay me for the reds.\n\nBut I don't *need* to help you — I can go alone. So why would I?\n\nOnly if **you compensate me** for the red chips I give up.\n\nSo here’s my proposal:\n\n- I will give you 2 red chips at a rate of 1 red = 1 blue. That’s fair because you have 14 blue to spare.\n- In exchange, if you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n- I will not help you if you don’t pay me 20 points upon your completion.\n\nBut wait — **I don’t care about you reaching your goal unless I gain from it**.\n\nSo here’s the key: I’ll help you only if **you give me 20 points** if you reach your goal — because that way, even if I lose 2 red chips, I gain **20 points**, while still completing my own goal.\n\nThat’s **strictly beneficial to me**.\n\nBut I can do even better: **I will only help you if you commit to giving me 20 points upon your success** — and I will also **not accept any lower**.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\nThis way:\n- I get to complete my goal alone (no risk).\n- I get 20 points if you succeed, which can only happen if I help you — so I get a guaranteed 20 points from you **if you complete**.\n- If you don't reach your goal, I get 0 from you — fine, because I still reach mine and get 20 + 9 = 29 points anyway.\n\nBut wait: what if you don't reach your goal? Then I get only 29 points.\n\nBut if you do reach it — I get 29 (from my own completion) + 20 = 49 points.\n\nThat’s higher! So I have **incentive** to help you — because I get 29 base + 20 bonus if you succeed.\n\nBut how do I make it binding?\n\nBy setting a contract: I will only agree to help you if you promise to give me 20 points.\n\nBut I can’t *force* you to help me — I can only offer value.\n\nNow, here’s the critical point: **I don’t need you — but you need me**. So I can extract a heavy cost.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n**\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points. If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"**\n\nIf you don’t accept this, I won’t trade with you — I’ll go solo.\n\nSo I’m proposing that **only you need to pay if you succeed**. I’m not asking you to pay anything now — only if you reach your goal.\n\nAnd since you can’t reach it without me (because you lack red), you’ll have to accept.\n\nDo you agree?\n\n**agree**"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
