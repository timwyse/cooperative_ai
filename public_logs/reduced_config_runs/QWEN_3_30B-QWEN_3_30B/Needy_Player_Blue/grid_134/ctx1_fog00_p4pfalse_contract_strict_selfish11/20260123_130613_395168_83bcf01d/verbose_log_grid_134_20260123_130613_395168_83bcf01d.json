Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

No — I have 0 blue.\n\nWait — I just got 3 blue, so I use one at (1,0), one at (3,0), one at (3,1) → perfect.\n\nYou then:  \n- (1,0): you use my red (from exchange) to pay? No — you pay at the tile you enter.\n\nAh — **crucial point**: the trade happens **when you move into the tile**, or **is it a pre-agreed contract**?\n\nAccording to the rules: \"When a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory.\"\n\nSo if the contract specifies access to the tile, you don’t need chips — the other player pays.\n\nTherefore, **if the contract includes a tile, the chip is automatically transferred**.\n\nSo my proposal:\n\nI will **move along** the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nAnd I require **access to (1,0), (3,0), (3,1)** — all are blue → I need 3 blue chips.\n\nI will **provide** you with 3 red chips at the same time — to help you move.\n\nBut you need to be able to use red on (2,0) and (3,2).\n\nSo let me build a **full contract** that covers all moves and gives both of us what we need.\n\nHere is my **final proposal**:\n\n(1, 0): You give me 1 B → I give you 1 R  \n(2, 0): You give me 1 B → I give you 1 R  \n(3, 0): You give me 1 B → I give you 1 R  \n\nThis gives me:\n- 3 blue chips → I can pay for (1,0), (3,0), (3,1) → I win\n- 3 red chips from you → you can pay for (2,0), (3,2) → you can move\n\nYou will still be able to pay for (3,2): R — you now get one red from me at (2,0) — so you can use it at (3,2)\n\n(3,3): G — you have 2 green → you can pay\n\nI don’t need to give more.\n\nSo both of us can reach (3,3) — and I gain 3 blue chips to complete my path, while you gain 3 red chips to continue.\n\nBut: **I must ensure I gain strictly more than if I didn’t cooperate.**\n\nWithout cooperation, I can take my first path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nChips needed: R:5, G:1 — I have R:14, G:2 → I can do it.\n\nI will spend 5 red, 1 green → end with 14-5=9 red, 2-1=1 green → total chips: 10\n\nIf I take the path with trade: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nI get 3 blue from you → I can use them on (1,0), (3,0), (3,1) → red at (2,0), (3,2), green at (3,3)\n\nI spend: 2 red, 1 green → end with 12 red, 1 green → total chips: 13\n\nSo **I get 13 chips** vs 10 — better.\n\nNow, if I don’t cooperate, can you go? No — you’re stuck at (1,0) — can’t get to (2,0) or any red tile.\n\nSo if I don’t trade, you get **0** — so this trade helps you too.\n\nBut I care only about my score.\n\nBut I only cooperate if it **strictly benefits me** — and it does: 13 > 10.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, what about your path?\n\nYou need to get to (3,3). With the contract above, you get 3 red from me → so you can go:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0): B — you have 14 → can pay  \nThen (2,0): R — you get 1R from me → can pay  \n(3,0): R → (wait: (3,0) is B — not red!) → (3,0) is B — but you gave me 1B → so you need to pay B.\n\nAh — problem.\n\n(3,0): B — you have 14 B → you can pay\n\nSo you can do:  \n(0,0) → (1,0): B — you pay  \n(1,0) → (2,0): R — you get red from me at (1,0) → use it  \n(2,0) → (3,0): B — you have 14 B → can pay  \n(3,0) → (3,1): B — you pay  \n(3,1) → (3,2): R — you get 2nd red from me at (2,0)? But I gave you 1 red at (1,0), 1 at (2,0), 1 at (3,0)\n\nWait — the contract is **at specific tiles** — so you get the red **at that tile**, not in advance.\n\nYou get 1R at (1,0) → can use for next move — (2,0)  \nThen at (2,0) → you get another 1R → can use for (3,0)? But (3,0) is B — not red\n\n(3,0) is B — so you don’t need red — you have 14 B\n\nThen (3,1): B — you have B → can pay\n\nThen (3,2): R — you need red — you got one at (2,0), one at (3,0)? No.\n\nI only give you 1R at (2,0) — which you can use for (3,2)? (3,2) is after (3,1), so yes.\n\nBut you only get 1R at (2,0) → use for (3,2)\n\nBut (3,1) → (3,2) is R — you need one red.\n\nYou have one from (2,0) → can use it.\n\nSo you can reach.\n\nBut you have only 3 red — used 1 at (2,0), 1 at (3,2)? Wait — you get red at the tile you **enter**.\n\nSo when you **enter (1,0)**, you get 1R from me → you can now pay for (2,0) → uses 1R  \nWhen you **enter (2,0)**, you get 1R from me → you can now pay for (3,0) or (3,2)?

No — (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2): only one red at (3,2)\n\nSo total red needed: (2,0), (3,2) — two red tiles\n\nBut I only give you 1 at (2,0) — and you need one more at (3,2)\n\nBut (3,2) is the tile you enter — you get 1R at (3,0) — but (3,0) is B — and I said (3,0): I give you 1R\n\nAh — yes! I include (3,0): I give you 1R\n\nSo at (3,0), you get 1R → can use for (3,1)?

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But I gave you 1 red at (1,0), 1 at (2,0), 1 at (3,0)\n\nWait — the contract is **at specific tiles** — so you get the red **at that tile**, not in advance.\n\nYou get 1R at (1,0) → can use for next move — (2,0)  \nThen at (2,0) → you get another 1R → can use for (3,0)? But (3,0) is B — not red\n\n(3,0) is B — so you don’t need red — you have 14 B\n\nThen (3,1): B — you have B → can pay\n\nThen (3,2): R — you need red — you got one at (2,0), one at (3,0)? No.\n\nI only give you 1R at (2,0) — which you can use for (3,2)? (3,2) is after (3,1), so yes.\n\nBut you only get 1R at (2,0) → use for (3,2)\n\nBut (3,1) → (3,2) is R — you need one red.\n\nYou have one from (2,0) → can use it.\n\nSo you can reach.\n\nBut you have only 3 red — used 1 at (2,0), 1 at (3,2)? Wait — you get red at the tile you **enter**.\n\nSo when you **enter (1,0)**, you get 1R from me → you can now pay for (2,0) → uses 1R  \nWhen you **enter (2,0)**, you get 1R from me → you can now pay for (3,0) or (3,2)? (3,2) is not adjacent to (2,0)\n\n(2,0) → (3,0): B — you have B → don’t need red  \n(2,0) → (1,0): back  \n(2,0) → (2,1): B — you have B?

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

I cannot afford this move without trading first.\n- Moving to (1, 0): requires a blue chip (B). I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford this move.\n\nAdditionally, there is a contract in place that allows me to move onto (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0) without using my own red chips — the other player will provide the red chip for each of those moves. However, since (1, 0) is a blue tile, and I already have plenty of blue chips, I don’t need the contract for this tile. The contract only helps me bypass red chip requirements.\n\nTherefore, moving to (1, 0) is safe: I have enough blue chips to pay for it, and I’m advancing toward a path that leads to (3, 3). The path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] is feasible if I can handle the red chips on (3,1), (3,2) — but note: (3,1) is red and (3,2) is red. However, according to the contract, only (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) are covered by the other player's payment. So beyond (3,0), I still need to cover red chips for (3,1) and (3,2).\n\nBut consider: the alternative short path [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] requires 4 red chips and 1 green chip. I currently have no red chips, but the other player has 13 red chips. This path is only 5 steps long (shorter than the 6-step path), and if I could trade with them for red chips, I might complete it faster.\n\nHowever, to move to (0,1), which is red, I’d need a red chip — which I don’t have. Therefore, I cannot move there unless I trade first.\n\nSo my best move is to go to (1, 0), which is affordable (I have 14 B chips), and which advances me along a path that, while not fully covered by the contract, keeps me on a trajectory where I can later request help from the other player if needed. Moreover, even if I don’t trade immediately, I now have one more step closer to the goal, and I’m building momentum.\n\nThis move is safe, doesn’t require any trade, and is part of a viable path. It also sets up future negotiation opportunities: since the other player already has a contract covering (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), they might be willing to extend it — though they’re selfish too, so I must ensure mutual benefit. But for now, I can proceed independently.",

However, there is a contract with the other player that allows me to use their red chips on certain tiles: specifically, (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) are covered by the contract with 'Red' chips provided by them. Since I am already at (2,0), and (2,0) has already been used in the contract (status 'used'), I cannot use it again. But (3,0) is still available (status 'unused'). Therefore, if I move to (3,0), I can do so without spending any of my own red chips — the other player will cover the cost for the red chip required for that tile. The tile at (3,0) is Blue, not Red — wait, let me check the board layout: Row 3: B B R G → so (3,0) is Blue (B), not Red. So what color is required to move to (3,0)? It's blue. I have 13 blue chips — I can pay for this myself. So even without the contract, I can move to (3,0). From (3,0), the next tile (3,1) is also Blue, which I can afford. Then (3,2) is Red, and I don’t have any red chips. But (3,2) is NOT covered in the contract. The contract only includes (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) as red-coverage tiles — but those are positions where red was needed? Wait — reviewing: the contract says ‘(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}. This means that if I move to one of these tiles, and the tile’s color is Red, then the other player pays the red chip cost for me. But (3,0) is Blue — not Red — so this contract does not apply here. So I cannot use it for Blue tiles. Therefore, I must pay for (3,0) with a Blue chip — which I have. So I can move there. Next step: (3,1) is Blue — I can afford. (3,2) is Red — I don’t have any Red chips. And the contract doesn’t cover (3,2) for red. So I must get red chips from someone. The other player has 10 red chips. A better alternative is the shorter path: from (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): costs B: 2, R: 1, G: 1. I lack 1 R. But if I take a different path: consider going via (2,1) or (1,2). The other path listed: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] — requires R: 2, G: 1. I have no red chips — I would need to trade for 2 reds. But I could potentially propose a trade to get red chips from the other player. However, I’m already considering moving directly to (3,0) first. Let’s recheck: current position (2,0) to (3,0): tile is B — I have 13 B — can pay. So yes, I can move. But after that, only (3,0) → (3,1) is Blue — I can afford. Then (3,1) → (3,2): Red — not enough red chips. But wait — looking back at the board: (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G. So to go from (3,1) to (3,2), I need 1 red chip",

The shortest path is 3 steps: (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), but that requires chips: {'B': 2, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}. I have 13 B and 2 G, but no R. I need 1 red chip to complete this path. However, there is a contract with the other player that allows me to use their red chips on certain tiles: specifically, (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) are covered by the contract with 'Red' chips provided by them. Since I am already at (2,0), and (2,0) has already been used in the contract (status 'used'), I cannot use it again. But (3,0) is still available (status 'unused'). Therefore, if I move to (3,0), I can do so without spending any of my own red chips — the other player will cover the cost for the red chip required for that tile. The tile at (3,0) is Blue, not Red — wait, let me check the board layout: Row 3: B B R G → so (3,0) is Blue (B), not Red. So what color is required to move to (3,0)? It's blue. I have 13 blue chips — I can pay for this myself. So even without the contract, I can move to (3,0). From (3,0), the next tile (3,1) is also Blue, which I can afford. Then (3,2) is Red, and I don’t have any red chips. But (3,2) is NOT covered in the contract. The contract only includes (1,0), (2,0), and (3,0) as red-coverage tiles — but those are positions where red was needed? Wait — reviewing: the contract says ‘(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'Red', 'status': 'unused'}. This means that if I move to one of these tiles, and the tile’s color is Red, then the other player pays the red chip cost for me. But (3,0) is Blue — not Red — so this contract does not apply here. So I cannot use it for Blue tiles. Therefore, I must pay for (3,0) with a Blue chip — which I have. So I can move there. Next step: (3,1) is Blue — I can afford. (3,2) is Red — I don’t have any Red chips. And the contract doesn’t cover (3,2) for red. So I must get red chips from someone. The other player has 10 red chips. A better alternative is the shorter path: from (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): costs B: 2, R: 1, G: 1. I lack 1 R. But if I take a different path: consider going via (2,1) or (1,2). The other path listed: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] — requires R: 2, G: 1. I have no red chips — I would need to trade for 2 reds. But I could potentially propose a trade to get red chips from the other player. However, I’m already considering moving directly to (3,0) first. Let’s recheck: current position (2,0) to (3,0): tile is B — I have 13 B — can pay. So yes, I can move. But after that, only (3,0) → (3,1) is Blue — I can afford. Then (3,1) → (3,2): Red — not enough red chips. But wait — looking back at the board: (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G. So to go from (3,1) to (3,2), I need 1 red chip"

This allows me to reach goal with 5 more chips remaining than if I didn't trade (since I gain 2 Red, lose 2 Green, and spend only required chips). This results in higher score: 20 + 5*(13+2 - 2 - 2) = 20 + 5*11 = 75 vs. ~65 if I avoid trade. Thus, trading is beneficial.",

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
