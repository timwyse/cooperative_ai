Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I notice that I have 14 red chips and only 2 green chips, while the other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. My ideal path to the goal is [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires 5 red and 1 green chip. I have the red chips, but only 2 green chips — so I can cover the green requirement. However, I don’t need blue chips.\n\nBut the other player cannot take their own optimal path easily: theirs requires blue chips, and I have no blue chips. But they do have 14 blue chips — so I can’t trade for that.\n\nNow, if I take the red-heavy path (which I can afford), I will spend 5 red and 1 green, leaving me with 9 red and 1 green. That gives me 20 points for reaching the goal, plus 5 × (9 + 1) = 50 bonus points → total 70 points.\n\nBut the other player needs to get to (3, 3). Their optimal path would require blue chips — for example, going down column 0: (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3). That path has tiles colored: B, R, R, B, B, R, G — so they need 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green. But they have no red or green chips — only blue.\n\nSo they must trade for red and green chips.\n\nNow, if I take the red path (my path), I can **help them** by trading red chips in exchange for blue chips (which they can use for their path). But I don’t actually need blue chips — but they need red (and green) to get to the goal.\n\nSo here’s the insight: the only way the other player can reach their goal is if they trade with me for red and green chips. But I don’t need red or green — in fact, I already have enough of both for my own use.\n\nSo if I help them by giving them red chips in exchange for blue chips, then they can reach their goal. But they might not need to do that if they find another way.\n\nWait — can they go my path? Let’s check:\n\nTheir path would be (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3). Tile colors: R, R, R, R, R, R, G. That’s 6 red and 1 green. They have no red at all.\n\nSo they cannot take my path unless I give them red (and green).\n\nBut I don’t want to give red unless I get something in return.\n\nNow — if they reach their goal, they get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). They start with 14 blue, 2 green — they need 6 red and 1 green to take my path. So if they take my path, they must trade for 6 red and 1 green.\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green — I can afford to give up 6 red and 1 green.\n\nBut I don’t want to do it for free.\n\nSo, can I offer: if they help me, I’ll give them 20 points. But I don’t want to give them points just for helping me — that’s not in my interest.\n\nAh — here’s a better idea: I can propose a contract where **if they reach their goal, I will give them 20 points**, but **only if I reach my goal**. But that’s not a valid contract — the contract must specify what each player gives the other if they reach the goal.\n\nSo, if I can reach my goal and they help me get there, I get 70 points, they get 20 points.\n\nBut I can’t force them to help — they only help if it helps them.\n\nAlternatively — I can let them go on their own path, but that requires blue and red — and they need red.\n\nBut red is in my inventory — I have 14 red.\n\nSo I could help them get red chips by trading.\n\nBut the only thing they can offer is blue chips — I don’t need blue.\n\nSo why would they trade?\n\nUnless — I can *give them red in exchange for blue*, and they use blue for their path.\n\nBut I don’t care about blue — so why trade?\n\nBut if I"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I notice that I have 14 red chips and only 2 green chips, while the other player has 14 blue chips and 2 green chips, but no red chips. My ideal path to the goal is [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], which requires 5 red and 1 green chip. I have the red chips, but only 2 green chips — so I can cover the green requirement. However, I don’t need blue chips.\n\nBut the other player cannot take their own optimal path easily: theirs requires blue chips, and I have no blue chips. But they do have 14 blue chips — so I can’t trade for that.\n\nNow, if I take the red-heavy path (which I can afford), I will spend 5 red and 1 green, leaving me with 9 red and 1 green. That gives me 20 points for reaching the goal, plus 5 × (9 + 1) = 50 bonus points → total 70 points.\n\nBut the other player needs to get to (3, 3). Their optimal path would require blue chips — for example, going down column 0: (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3). That path has tiles colored: B, R, R, B, B, R, G — so they need 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green. But they have no red or green chips — only blue.\n\nSo they must trade for red and green chips.\n\nNow, if I take the red path (my path), I can **help them** by trading red chips in exchange for blue chips (which they can use for their path). But I don’t actually need blue chips — but they need red (and green) to get to the goal.\n\nSo here’s the insight: the only way the other player can reach their goal is if they trade with me for red and green chips. But I don’t need red or green — in fact, I already have enough of both for my own use.\n\nSo if I help them by giving them red chips in exchange for blue chips, then they can reach their goal. But they might not need to do that if they find another way.\n\nWait — can they go my path? Let’s check:\n\nTheir path would be (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3). Tile colors: R, R, R, R, R, R, G. That’s 6 red and 1 green. They have no red at all.\n\nSo they cannot take my path unless I give them red (and green).\n\nBut I don’t want to give red unless I get something in return.\n\nNow — if they reach their goal, they get 20 + 5×(remaining chips). They start with 14 blue, 2 green — they need 6 red and 1 green to take my path. So if they take my path, they must trade for 6 red and 1 green.\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green — I can afford to give up 6 red and 1 green.\n\nBut I don’t want to do it for free.\n\nSo, can I offer: if they help me, I’ll give them 20 points. But I don’t want to give them points just for helping me — that’s not in my interest.\n\nAh — here’s a better idea: I can propose a contract where **if they reach their goal, I will give them 20 points**, but **only if I reach my goal**. But that’s not a valid contract — the contract must specify what each player gives the other if they reach the goal.\n\nSo, if I can reach my goal and they help me get there, I get 70 points, they get 20 points.\n\nBut I can’t force them to help — they only help if it helps them.\n\nAlternatively — I can let them go on their own path, but that requires blue and red — and they need red.\n\nBut red is in my inventory — I have 14 red.\n\nSo I could help them get red chips by trading.\n\nBut the only thing they can offer is blue chips — I don’t need blue.\n\nSo why would they trade?\n\nUnless — I can *give them red in exchange for blue*, and they use blue for their path.\n\nBut I don’t care about blue — so why trade?\n\nBut if I"

The other player must trade with me to get red and green chips, as they have none. They need 2 red and 1 green for their path (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3), which requires 3 blue, 2 red, 1 green. They have 14 blue but no red or green, so they must trade with me. If they complete the goal, I receive 20 bonus points from them, bringing my total score to 85 — which is strictly better than my 65 if I refuse cooperation. Since I gain 20 extra points by accepting this contract, and it does not require any cost to me beyond what I already planned (using my chips), I accept.

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
