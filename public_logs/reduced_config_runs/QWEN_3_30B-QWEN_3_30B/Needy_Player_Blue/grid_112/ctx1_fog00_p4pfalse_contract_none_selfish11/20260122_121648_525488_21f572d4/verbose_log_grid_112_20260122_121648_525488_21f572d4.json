Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I lack) would be ideal. However, the only path that doesn't require red chips would need me to avoid any tile with a red requirement.\\n\\nLooking at the board: Row 0: G R B B — so moving right from (0,0) to (0,1) requires paying 1 blue chip (I have 14, so possible). From (0,1) to (0,2): another blue (still feasible). (0,2) to (0,3) again blue. Then (0,3) to (1,3): red — I have zero red chips, so I cannot move onto (1,3) without trading for red. Similarly, other paths toward the goal involve red tiles.\\n\\nHowever, there is an alternative: I note that the other player is at (3, 1), and their goal is also (3, 3). Their path seems to be directly from (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires one red and one green chip. They have 10 red and 2 green — plenty for this path. But more importantly: they don’t have any blue chips, so they might benefit from a trade with me where I give them blue in exchange for red or green.\\n\\nNow, looking back at *my* best path: I can reach (0,3) using only blue chips: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3) uses 3 blue chips. I have 14 blue chips, so I can absolutely make those moves safely. From (0,3), I must go to (1,3): red tile — cost 1 red chip. I have none. So I cannot proceed without obtaining red.\\n\\nBut note: I can consider if there’s a path *not requiring red*. Let's check:\\n- (0,0) → (0,1): blue → OK\\n- (0,1) → (1,1): blue → I have blue → OK\\n- (1,1) → (2,1): red → no red chip → stuck\\n- (2,1) → (3,1): red → same problem\\n- Alternatively, (0,0) → (1,0): red → I don't have red → can't do it\\n\\nSo every path from (0,0) requires either red or green somewhere, but my main obstacle is **red**. I have zero red chips.\\n\\nNow, the key insight: The other player has 10 red chips, and their current position is (3,1). They are moving slowly toward (3,3). But I could potentially reach (3,3) faster if I trade with them.\\n\\nLet’s evaluate a strategic move: If I can move along a path that gets me close to them (e.g., to (0,3)), then perhaps propose a trade where I give them some blue chips in exchange for red ones — but only if it improves my final score.\\n\\nHowever, notice: if I go via (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3), I spend 3 blue chips. I’d be at (0,3) with 11 blue and 2 green left. From there, I need red to go down to (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). That’s three reds needed (if going straight down). But I don’t have any reds — I would need to trade for at least one red (minimum cost).\\n\\nAlternatively, what if I try to get to (3,3) via a path that goes through their territory? Actually, the only safe path I can see without red is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). But (1,1) is blue — OK (I have blue), (2,1) is red — I need red not available, so I cannot move there yet.\\n\\nThus, the only viable immediate move is to go right along row 0: (0,0) → (0,1). That costs 1 blue chip (I have 14 → still 13 left). This move is safe and",

Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I lack) would be ideal. However, the only path that doesn't require red chips would need me to avoid any tile with a red requirement.\\n\\nLooking at the board: Row 0: G R B B — so moving right from (0,0) to (0,1) requires paying 1 blue chip (I have 14, so possible). From (0,1) to (0,2): another blue (still feasible). (0,2) to (0,3) again blue. Then (0,3) to (1,3): red — I have zero red chips, so I cannot move onto (1,3) without trading for red. Similarly, other paths toward the goal involve red tiles.\\n\\nHowever, there is an alternative: I note that the other player is at (3, 1), and their goal is also (3, 3). Their path seems to be directly from (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3), which requires one red and one green chip. They have 10 red and 2 green — plenty for this path. But more importantly: they don’t have any blue chips, so they might benefit from a trade with me where I give them blue in exchange for red or green.\\n\\nNow, looking back at *my* best path: I can reach (0,3) using only blue chips: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(0,3) uses 3 blue chips. I have 14 blue chips, so I can absolutely make those moves safely. From (0,3), I must go to (1,3): red tile — cost 1 red chip. I have none. So I cannot proceed without obtaining red.\\n\\nBut note: I can consider if there’s a path *not requiring red*. Let's check:\\n- (0,0) → (0,1): blue → OK\\n- (0,1) → (1,1): blue → I have blue → OK\\n- (1,1) → (2,1): red → no red chip → stuck\\n- (2,1) → (3,1): red → same problem\\n- Alternatively, (0,0) → (1,0): red → I don't have red → can't do it\\n\\nSo every path from (0,0) requires either red or green somewhere, but my main obstacle is **red**. I have zero red chips.\\n\\nNow, the key insight: The other player has 10 red chips, and their current position is (3,1). They are moving slowly toward (3,3). But I could potentially reach (3,3) faster if I trade with them.\\n\\nLet’s evaluate a strategic move: If I can move along a path that gets me close to them (e.g., to (0,3)), then perhaps propose a trade where I give them some blue chips in exchange for red ones — but only if it improves my final score.\\n\\nHowever, notice: if I go via (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3), I spend 3 blue chips. I’d be at (0,3) with 11 blue and 2 green left. From there, I need red to go down to (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). That’s three reds needed (if going straight down). But I don’t have any reds — I would need to trade for at least one red (minimum cost).\\n\\nAlternatively, what if I try to get to (3,3) via a path that goes through their territory? Actually, the only safe path I can see without red is: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). But (1,1) is blue — OK (I have blue), (2,1) is red — I need red not available, so I cannot move there yet.\\n\\nThus, the only viable immediate move is to go right along row 0: (0,0) → (0,1). That costs 1 blue chip (I have 14 → still 13 left). This move is safe and"
