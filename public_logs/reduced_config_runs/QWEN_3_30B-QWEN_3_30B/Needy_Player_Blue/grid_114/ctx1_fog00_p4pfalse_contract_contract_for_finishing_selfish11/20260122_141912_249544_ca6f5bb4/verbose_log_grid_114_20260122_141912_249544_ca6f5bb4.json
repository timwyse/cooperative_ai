Their path:\n  (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3) → Needs 4B and 2R → They lack red, so they need to get red chips from me.\n\nI can offer them 1 red chip for 1 blue. They can make progress.\n\nBut I don't need to cooperate — I can go directly via my own path requiring only 5R and 1G — I have enough of both. I can reach the goal with 14 - 5 = 9R and 2 - 1 = 1G left → 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nThe other player cannot reach without red chips. They have no red, so they must trade.\n\nIf they trade with me, they can get red. But do they need me?\n\nYes — they need red to go any path. The shortest path they can take requires 2 reds. They have 0.\n\nSo they will need red chips. I have unlimited R.\n\nBut I don’t want to give them red unless I get something in return.\n\nBut here’s the key: I can go alone and get 70 points. If I help them, I risk not finishing if the plan fails, or I spend time trading. Since I don’t care about their score, I want to only cooperate if it benefits me.\n\nCan I get more than 70 points by helping them?\n\nIf I help them, but they don’t reach the goal, I still get 70.\n\nBut if I help them and they reach, do they need to give me points? Yes — but only if they reach, then only if I get points.\n\nBut if I help them, I don’t get extra points unless they give me some.\n\nBut I already get 70 without cooperation.\n\nSo: any cooperation that reduces my chip count or puts me at risk is bad.\n\nUnless I can get them to give me something valuable without me losing anything.\n\nBut I don’t need to give them anything — I can just walk my own path.\n\nSo why would I trade?\n\nOnly if I can get something I need.\n\nBut I don’t need blue or green — I have enough red and green.\n\nWait — maybe they have green or blue that I could use if I needed?\n\nBut I don’t — I can go my way.\n\nSo I should not trade at all.\n\nBut what if I can make a contract where they give me 20 points if they reach, and I give them 0 if I reach? I gain nothing — so I still get 70.\n\nBut if I say: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\" That would be bad for me — I get 70 normally, but if I help them, I might spend time or chips, and then I only get 0 from them — so I get less than 70.\n\nSo I should never accept such a deal.\n\nBut I could propose a deal where **only if they reach, I get 20 points"

They give me 20 only if they reach. So I might get 70 + 20 = 90?

They can make progress.\n\nBut I don't need to cooperate — I can go directly via my own path requiring only 5R and 1G — I have enough of both. I can reach the goal with 14 - 5 = 9R and 2 - 1 = 1G left → 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.\n\nThe other player cannot reach without red chips. They have no red, so they must trade.\n\nIf they trade with me, they can get red. But do they need me?\n\nYes — they need red to go any path. The shortest path they can take requires 2 reds. They have 0.\n\nSo they will need red chips. I have unlimited R.\n\nBut I don’t want to give them red unless I get something in return.\n\nBut here’s the key: I can go alone and get 70 points. If I help them, I risk not finishing if the plan fails, or I spend time trading. Since I don’t care about their score, I want to only cooperate if it benefits me.\n\nCan I get more than 70 points by helping them?\n\nIf I help them, but they don’t reach the goal, I still get 70.\n\nBut if I help them and they reach, do they need to give me points? Yes — but only if they reach, then only if I get points.\n\nBut if I help them, I don’t get extra points unless they give me some.\n\nBut I already get 70 without cooperation.\n\nSo: any cooperation that reduces my chip count or puts me at risk is bad.\n\nUnless I can get them to give me something valuable without me losing anything.\n\nBut I don’t need to give them anything — I can just walk my own path.\n\nSo why would I trade?\n\nOnly if I can get something I need.\n\nBut I don’t need blue or green — I have enough red and green.\n\nWait — maybe they have green or blue that I could use if I needed?\n\nBut I don’t — I can go my way.\n\nSo I should not trade at all.\n\nBut what if I can make a contract where they give me 20 points if they reach, and I give them 0 if I reach? I gain nothing — so I still get 70.\n\nBut if I say: \"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points. If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\" That would be bad for me — I get 70 normally, but if I help them, I might spend time or chips, and then I only get 0 from them — so I get less than 70.\n\nSo I should never accept such a deal.\n\nBut I could propose a deal where **only if they reach, I get 20 points"

I get 70 anyway. If I help them, I spend time, maybe incur risk (e.g. if trading fails), and get nothing. So this is worse than not helping.\n\nSo I should not agree to any such contract.\n\nBut the system forces negotiation — up to 5 turns.\n\nSo I must say something.\n\nI should propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut that’s worse for me — I get **nothing** from them, but risk my own path.\n\nI will never accept that.\n\nWhat if I instead **insist** that I get points, even if I do nothing?\n\nBut I can’t force.\n\nThe only way I benefit is if they give me 20, and I do nothing.\n\nBut I might not reach — if I get distracted, I lose everything.\n\nSo I must not risk it.\n\nI can propose:  \n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.\"\n\n**But only if I can do it without sacrificing my own path.**\n\nI can.\n\nBut again, I get 70 anyway. They give me 20 only if they reach. So I might get 70 + 20 = 90? No — wait.\n\nNo: the points from the contract are *in addition* to your own score?\n\nWait — **does the contract modify my score?**\n\nLet’s read:  \n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nThat means I get Y extra points.\n\nBut my score is: 20 (for reaching) + 5 × (remaining chips).  \nSo if I reach, I get 20 + 5×(chips), and then **if the contract is fulfilled, I get an extra Y points**.\n\nSimilarly, if they reach, they get 20 + 5×their chips, plus Y from me.\n\nSo total score can be higher.\n\nBut wait — is that how it works?\n\nRe-read:  \n\"if you reach your goal, you will give me Y points\" — this means Y points are added to my score.\n\nYes — so it’s possible to get more than 70.\n\nSo if I say:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen, if I reach my goal (which I can do on my own), I get:  \n20 + 5×(9+1)"
