Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade.

Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only.

Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
