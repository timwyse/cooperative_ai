But I’m not at (0,1).

I can afford that move: I have 11 red chips, so I can pay for it without needing help.\\n\\nTherefore, I will move to (1,3) now. After that, I’ll be at (1,3), then I can ask for help with the next move: (2,3), which is blue. At that point, I can propose: \\\"I'll pay your red move if you cover my blue move.\\\" Since I have red chips and they have blue chips, that’s a good exchange. \\n\\nBut since I *can* make the first move (to (1,3)) without requiring any prior agreement, and doing so brings me closer to my goal while keeping flexibility, I should do it now.\\n\\nMoreover, if I delay, the other player might move and block paths, or use their chips elsewhere.

I currently have: R: 11, G: 2, B: 0 — so I have enough red and green chips, but no blue chips. Since I don't have any blue chips, I cannot move to (2, 3) unless the other player covers that cost for me.\n\nHowever, examining the other player’s inventory: they have B: 13, G: 2, R: 0 — so they have plenty of blue chips but no red. That makes them ideal for covering blue moves.\n\nIf I propose a trade where they cover my blue moves (e.g., cover the cost of stepping on (2, 3)), and I cover their red moves (e.g., if they need to step on red tiles), this could be mutually beneficial — but only if it leads me to strictly increase my final score.\n\nLet’s analyze the options:\n\nOption A: Move directly toward goal via (1,3), (2,3), (3,3):\n- (1,3): red → require 1 red chip → I have 11 → OK\n- (2,3): blue → require 1 blue chip → I have 0 → Not OK → must negotiate or avoid.\n\nSo I can only proceed if the other player agrees to cover my blue move(s).\n\nI could instead consider a longer path: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n- (2,2): blue → same issue\n- (3,2): blue → also blue\n→ two blue costs → would need coverage from other player.\n\nAlternatively, the path given in the analysis: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] — that's 5 steps with R:1, B:3, G:1. But I’m not at (0,1). To take that path, I’d need to go back to (2,1), etc. — but that’s not efficient and increases steps unnecessarily.\n\nBut here’s the key: I currently have 11 red chips, and the other player has 0. They can’t help me with red, but I can help them with red.\n\nMy best chance is to **propose a trade** where I cover the cost of one red move for them, and they cover up to 1 (or more) blue move(s) for me.\n\nSince I’m at (1,2), the immediate next move toward my short path is (1,3) — red tile. I can afford that move: I have 11 red chips, so I can pay for it without needing help.\n\nTherefore, I will move to (1,3) now. After that, I’ll be at (1,3), then I can ask for help with the next move: (2,3), which is blue. At that point, I can propose: \"I'll pay your red move if you cover my blue move.\" Since I have red chips and they have blue chips, that’s a good exchange. \n\nBut since I *can* make the first move (to (1,3)) without requiring any prior agreement, and doing so brings me closer to my goal while keeping flexibility, I should do it now.\n\nMoreover, if I delay, the other player might move and block paths, or use their chips elsewhere. Moving now maximizes my control.\n\nThus, I will proceed with (1,3) as the next move.",

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently.

The other player has 9 red chips and only 1 green, so they are rich in red. I can trade red chips I have surplus of for their red coverage to enable a shorter path.

The only viable path without trading requires 1 red chip, which I don't possess. But the other player already reached goal and has no incentive to help me. Since I cannot gain red coverage from them (as they didn't promise it), and I have no red chips to trade, no beneficial trade exists. I must consider an alternative path using only available chips. Using only my current B and G chips, I could try a longer path avoiding red tiles—this would work if I don’t need red. Checking the board: from (0,1), moving down to (1,1): B (need 1 B), then (2,1): B (another B), (3,1): B (third B), (3,2): B (fourth B), (3,3): G (needs 1 G).

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement.

The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
