In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you.

However, the other player has 14 blue chips, 2 green chips, and 0 red chips, and their path to the goal likely requires red chips, which they lack.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- My path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [R] → (2,1) [R] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [R] → (3,3): requires 5R, 1G. I have enough R and G.\n- Their path: (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3): requires 3B, 2R. They have 14B, but 0R — they cannot make the final two moves without red.\n\nThey cannot reach their goal without help — they need red chips, which I have. I, on the other hand, can reach my goal independently using my red and green chips.\n\nSo, I have leverage: I can choose not to trade, and I can still win. But if I help them, I can gain points in return, which might be worth it.\n\nBut: if I do not help them, they’ll fail → get 0 points. If they do not reach their goal, I get nothing from them. So I must get a reward from them only if they *actually* reach the goal.\n\nSo, I propose:\n- If I help them reach their goal (by covering their red chip costs where needed), and they reach (3,3), then they will give me 20 points.\n- In return, if they help me reach my goal, I will give them 0 points.\n\nWhy? Because:\n- I can reach my goal without them.\n- They cannot reach their goal without me.\n- So if I help them, they will succeed and give me 20 points.\n- I don’t need them to help me — so I don’t owe them anything.\n- So I get 20 points from them if they succeed (which they will only do if I help).\n- I still reach my goal anyway, so I get 20 points for reaching it, plus 5 points per chip left.\n- My path uses 5R and 1G → I’ll have 14 - 5 = 9R, and 2 - 1 = 1G → 10 chips left → 50 points from chips.\n- Total: 20 (goal) + 50 = 70 points from me.\n- Plus 20 from them, if I help them → total **90 points**.\n\nWait — but the other player’s path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1) [B] → (0,2) [B] → (0,3) [B] → (1,3) [R] → (2,3) [R] → (3,3): 3B + 2R\n- But I have plenty of R, but no B? Wait — do I have B? My inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14} — no blue chips.\n\nSo if I cover red for them, I can help — they need 2 red moves — so I commit to covering 2 red moves for them.\n\nBut — they are at (0,0), same as me.\n\nSo if I help them via trade, I can do:\n- Propose: I will cover 2 red moves for you (for their path) — so they can go from (0,3) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (3,3) without spending their own red chips.\n- In return, *if they reach their goal, they give me 20 points*.\n\nI don’t need their help — I can go by path with 5R and 1G. I’ll have 9R and 1G left → 10 chips → 50 points from chips, plus 20 = 70.\n\nBut if I help them, and they succeed, I get an extra 20 → 90 points.\n\nThey, if I help them, will have 14B - 3B = 11B left → 11 chips → 55 points from chips,"

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 0}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 20}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
