HOWEVER, THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE PATH: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)] THAT REQUIRES 4 RED AND 1 GREEN CHIPS. THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE FOR ME SINCE I HAVE NO RED CHIPS. THERE IS NO SHORT PATH AVAILABLE THAT USES ONLY MY CURRENT CHIPS WITHOUT A DEFICIT. BUT TRADING RED CHIPS ISN'T POSSIBLE SINCE I HAVE ZERO. I CANNOT RECEIVE RED CHIPS UNLESS THE OTHER PLAYER OFFERS THEM, BUT THEY HAVE 13 RED CHIPS — THEY MIGHT TRADE RED FOR SOMETHING I HAVE. HOWEVER, I HAVE NO EXCESS RED CHIPS TO OFFER.

SINCE I ALREADY HAVE A PATH WITHOUT NEEDING TO TRADE (BUT WITH A DEFICIT), I MUST TRADE. BUT I CAN’T OFFER RED CHIPS.

BUT THIS ONLY WORKS IF THE OTHER PLAYER AGREES. CRUCIALLY, I’M NOT SURE THEY’LL ACCEPT. ALTERNATIVELY, I CAN USE THE LONGER PATH WITH 4 BLUE, 1 GREEN, 1 RED — STILL MISSING 1 RED. SO I MUST FIND A WAY TO GET 1 RED CHIP. SINCE I HAVE EXTRA BLUE, I CAN TRADE SOME BLUE FOR RED. BEST MOVE: OFFER 1 BLUE CHIP TO THE OTHER PLAYER TO COVER MY RED MOVE COST — BUT THEY MAY NOT ACCEPT. WAIT: IN 'PAY FOR OTHER' MODE, I CAN AGREE TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR MOVEMENT ON A COLOR, IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM COVERING MY MOVEMENT ON THAT COLOR. SO IF I PROMISE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR THEM, THEY CAN PROMISE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR ME. THAT ALLOWS ME TO STEP ON A RED TILE WITHOUT SPENDING MY OWN RED CHIP. BUT I HAVE 0 RED CHIPS — SO I CAN'T PAY FOR MY OWN MOVES. THEREFORE, IF I REQUEST THAT THEY COVER MY 1 RED MOVE, AND I AGREE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR THEM, IT’S BALANCED — WE EACH COVER 1 RED MOVE. THAT SAVES ME 1 RED CHIP, AND GIVES THEM 1 RED CHIP CREDIT. BUT I HAVE NO RED CHIPS TO SPEND ANYWAY — SO I CAN'T AFFORD TO COVER THEIR MOVE UNLESS THEY COMPENSATE ME.

IF I AGREE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR THEM, AND THEY COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR ME, I SAVE MY RED CHIP REQUIREMENT — I DON’T NEED TO SPEND ANY. SINCE I HAVE 0 RED CHIPS AND THEY HAVE 13, I SHOULD PROPOSE: I’LL COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR YOU IF YOU COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR ME.
