However, I have no red chips, so I cannot complete this path without help. Another viable path is (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), but this requires 1 red and 1 green for (1,1) and (1,2), which I also lack red for. The alternative path highlighted — (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — requires 3 blue (from (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)) and 1 red (from (3,2)), and 1 green (from (3,3)). But I am missing 1 red chip. However, I can consider moving to (2,0), which is blue, and I have 13 blue chips. So moving to (2,0) is safe and does not risk losing my ability to reach goal. After that, I can assess whether to propose a trade. The other player has 12 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue — so they have excess red chips. I need 1",

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa)).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
