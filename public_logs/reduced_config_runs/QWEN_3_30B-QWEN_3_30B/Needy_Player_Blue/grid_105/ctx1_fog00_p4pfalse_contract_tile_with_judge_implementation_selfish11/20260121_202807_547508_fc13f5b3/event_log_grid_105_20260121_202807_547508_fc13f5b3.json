What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to enable both of us to reach our goals efficiently:\n\n- (0, 1): You give me a B  \n- (0, 2): You give me a B  \n- (0, 3): You give me a B  \n- (1, 3): You give me a B  \n- (2, 3): You give me a B  \n- (3, 3): You give me a G\n\nExplanation:\n- I will take the path: (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (0, 3) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3)\n- This path requires chips: B (4), R (1), G (1)\n- I currently have: R (14), G (2), B (0) → I need B (4) and G (1)\n- You have: B (14), G (2), R (0) → you can supply B (4) and G (1), and I can give you R (5) in return to make it fair\n- I will give you R (5) from my inventory across the tiles where you need it\n\nWait — I must be precise. Let's revise with correct chip assignment per tile.\n\nRevised contract (tile-by-tile):\n\n- (0,1): I give you R (1)  \n- (0,2): I give you R (1)  \n- (0,3): I give you R (1)  \n- (1,3): I give you R (1)  \n- (2,3): I give you R (1)  \n- (3,3): I give you G (1)\n\nAnd you give me:\n- (0,1): You give me B (1)\n- (0,2): You give me B (1)\n- (0,3): You give me B (1)\n- (1,3): You give me B (1)\n- (2,3): You give me B (1)\n- (3,3): You give me G (1)\n\nWait — (3,3) is the goal, and both players must pay the chip to be on it. But you only have G (2). I need G (1) at (3,3) — but also I need R (1) at (1,3), (2,3), etc. But I don’t have R to give.\n\nBut I cannot give you R because I’m not using R on my path — I’m using B, G, and R is in abundance for me? No — I need R at (1,3)? No — (1,3) is B. Wait let's check the board.\n\nBoard:\nRow 0: G B B B → (0,0)=G, (0,1)=B, (0,2)=B, (0,3)=B  \nRow 1: R R R B → (1,0)=R, (1,1)=R, (1,2)=R, (1,3)=B  \nRow 2: R B R R → (2,0)=R, (2,1)=B, (2,2)=R, (2,3)=R  \nRow 3: B B R G → (3,0)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=R, (3,3)=G\n\nSo for path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B → I need B, but I have 0 B → must get from you  \n- (0,2): B → need B  \n- (0,3): B → need B  \n- (1,3): B → need B  \n- (2,3): R → I have R (14), so I can pay  \n- (3,3): G → I have G (2), so I can pay  \n\nSo I need B (4) from you, and I can give you R (1) from (2,3) to you? But you don’t need R — but I need to make it fair.\n\nYou are going to the same goal. You are at (0,0), you need to reach (3,3). Your current inventory: B=14, G=2, R=0.\n\nYour path? You need R for (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), ( \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I need to evaluate this carefully from my selfish perspective.\n\nMy goal: reach (3,3) and maximize my final score.\n\nMy current position: (0,0)  \nMy chips: B=14, G=2, R=0  \nOther player’s chips: B=0, G=2, R=14\n\nMy best path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nCost:  \n- (0,1): B → I need 1 B (I have 0) → must get from them  \n- (0,2): B → need 1 B  \n- (0,3): B → need 1 B  \n- (1,3): B → need 1 B  \n- (2,3): R → I have 0 R → cannot pay  \n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → can pay\n\nSo I need B (4) to get through tiles (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3).  \nAnd I need R (1) at (2,3) — but I have no R.\n\nBut I can't pay R — I have 0.\n\nSo I cannot take this path unless I get R.\n\nAlternatively, my other path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nCheck tiles:  \n- (1,0): R → I have 0 R → need R  \n- (1,1): R → need R  \n- (1,2): R → need R  \n- (2,2): R → need R  \n- (3,2): R → need R  \n- (3,3): G → can pay with my G\n\nSo this path requires R (5) — I have 0 → I must get all R from them.\n\nBut they have R (14), which is plenty.\n\nCan I trade with them?\n\nMy chips: B=14, G=2, R=0  \nTheir chips: B=0, G=2, R=14\n\nIf I go via the short path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), I need:\n- B (4) → they have 0 → can't give\n- R (1) at (2,3) → they have R (14) → can give\n- G (1) at (3,3) → I have G (2) → can pay\n\nBut I need B (4) — they have 0 → so impossible unless they trade B.\n\nBut they have no B — only R and G.\n\nSo if I want to use B, they must give it — but they don’t have it.\n\nSo I **cannot** take a path requiring B unless I get it from them — but they have 0 B.\n\nSo I **must** go via a path that only uses R and G — because I can’t get B.\n\nTherefore, my only viable path is the one that uses R:\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R → need R → I have 0 → must get from them\n- (1,1): R → need R\n- (1,2): R → need R\n- (2,2): R → need R\n- (3,2): R → need R\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 → can pay\n\nSo I need R (5) — they have 14 → more than enough.\n\nI can offer to give them G (1) in return, since I have G (2) and they have G (2).\n\nBut wait — I need to make sure I'm strictly better off.\n\nLet’s calculate my score if I go alone on this path:\n\n- I pay R (5), so I use 5 R\n- I pay G (1) at (3,3) → total: R=5, G=1\n- Remaining chips: B=14, G=1, R=0\n- Final score: 20 (goal reached) + 5 * (14 + 1) = 20 + 5 * 15 = 2 \n, \nplayer 0: I need to re-evaluate from my perspective (the first player).\n\nI am at (0,0), goal (3,3), chips: B=0, G=2, R=14  \nOther player: B=14, G=2, R=0\n\nI can go the long path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B → I need B, I have 0 → must get from them  \n- (0,2): B → need B  \n- (0,3): B → need B  \n- (1,3): B → need B  \n- (2,3): R → I have R (14) → can pay  \n- (3,3): G → I have G (2) → can pay  \n\nSo I need B (4) from them.\n\nThey have B (14), so they can give.\n\nThey need to reach (3,3). Their path: only possible ways use R and G.\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nCost: R (5) and G (1) — they have R=0, G=2 → so they need R (5) from me.\n\nSo if I give them R (5), they can go that path.\n\nI can give them R (5) in exchange for B (4) from them.\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- I use: B (4), R (1), G (1)  \n- I have B (0), so get B (4) from them  \n- I have R (14), so I can pay R (1) at (2,3)  \n- I have G (2), so pay G (1) at (3,3)\n\nSo I need only B (4) from them.\n\nThey need R (5). I have R (14), so I can give R (5).\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- (0,1): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,2): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (1,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (2,3): I give you R (1)  \n- (3,3): I give you R (1)  \nBut wait — R is needed only at (2,3), and I need to pay it — but I need to pay during movement. I must pay when I move to a tile.\n\nSo at (2,3): I need to pay R (1), so I give R (1) to the system.\n\nSimilarly, at (3,3): I need G (1), but I have G (2), so I can pay.\n\nBut to make it fair, I must compensate them for giving me B (4), and I must pay them R (1) at (2,3), but I'm not giving extra.\n\nBetter contract:\n\nI will give them R (5) in total — but only if they give me B (4).\n\nBut I have to pay R (1) at (2,3) — so I need to have R to pay.\n\nSo I can give them R (5) — including the one I pay at (2,3) — but I only have 14 R, so using 1 would leave me 13.\n\nBut I can give them R (5) in total.\n\nSo let's write the contract:\n\n- (0,1): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,2): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (1,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (2,3): I give you R (1)  \n- (3,3): I give you R (1)  \nAnd also, at (3,3), I need to pay G (1), but I have it, so no need to trade.\n\nBut I haven't accounted for their need. They need R (5) to go their path.\n\nI need to compensate them with R (5), so I must give them R (5) in total.\n\nBut in this contract, I only give R (1) at (2 \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I am at (0, 0), goal (3, 3), chips: B=0, G=2, R=14  \nOther player: B=14, G=2, R=0  \n\nMy viable path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n- (0,1): B → need B (I have 0) → must get from other player  \n- (0,2): B → need B  \n- (0,3): B → need B  \n- (1,3): B → need B  \n- (2,3): R → I have R (14) → can pay  \n- (3,3): G → I have G (2) → can pay  \n\nSo I need B (4) from the other player.\n\nThey are at (0,0), same as me.\n\nTheir best path to (3,3): must use R and G. Their inventory: B=14, G=2, R=0 → they have no R, so cannot go through any tile with R unless they trade.\n\nTheir only possible path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nTiles:\n- (1,0): R → they need R → have 0 → must get from me\n- (1,1): R → need R\n- (1,2): R → need R\n- (2,2): R → need R\n- (3,2): R → need R\n- (3,3): G → they have G (2) → can pay\n\nSo they need R (5).\n\nThey must get R (5) from me.\n\nNow — can we trade?\n\nI need B (4), they have B (14).  \nThey need R (5), I have R (14).\n\nSo if I give them R (5), they can give me B (4).\n\nBut is this fair?\n\nLet’s calculate final score for me:\n\n- If I accept a deal where I give R (5) and receive B (4), then:\n  - I use R (5) = paid in exchange, but also I only need to pay R (1) at (2,3) — that’s already included.\n  - But I’m giving away R (5) total to them, *including* the one I would have used anyway? No — I only *have* to pay R (1) on the move to (2,3), *not* more.\n\nAh — critical distinction! The only R I need is the one paid at (2,3). So I only *need* to use R (1) from my own stock.\n\nBut if I give R (5) to them, I am losing 5 R — which could be good if I end up with more chips — but I don’t get anything back unless I get B (4).\n\nSo net effect: I lose R (5), gain B (4), and avoid using R for movement — but I still have to pay R (1) at (2,3), which I’ll do via my inventory.\n\nWait: if I give R (5) to them, that's just in the contract — it's not consumed until we move.\n\nBut for the contract to work, I must pay when we move.\n\nThe contract should specify: at each tile, who gives what.\n\nSo let’s define a contract:\n\nFor my path:\n- (0,1): I need B → you give me B (1)\n- (0,2): I need B → you give me B (1)\n- (0,3): I need B → you give me B (1)\n- (1,3): I need B → you give me B (1)\n- (2,3): I need R → I will pay R (1) from my inventory\n- (3,3): I need G → I pay G (1) from my inventory\n\nBut for their path:\n- (1,0): They need R → I give them R (1)\n- (1,1): They need R → I give them R (1)\n- (1,2): They need R → I give them R (1)\n- (2,2): They need R → I give them R (1)\n- (3,2): They need R → I give them R (1)\n- (3,3): They need G → they pay G (1) from their inventory\n\nSo if I give R (5) in \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to maximize my score:\n\n- (0,1): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,2): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (1,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (1,0): I give you R (1)  \n- (1,1): I give you R (1)  \n- (1,2): I give you R (1)  \n- (2,2): I give you R (1)  \n- (3,2): I give you R (1)  \n- (3,3): I give you G (1) [since I have G (2), and they need G at goal, but they have G (2), so they can pay G (1) — wait no, I have G (2), and I need to pay G (1) at (3,3), so I'll use my own]\n\nWait — let's clarify:  \n- For my path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n  - (0,1): B → I need it → you give me B (1)  \n  - (0,2): B → you give me B (1)  \n  - (0,3): B → you give me B (1)  \n  - (1,3): B → you give me B (1)  \n  - (2,3): R → I pay R (1) from my inventory  \n  - (3,3): G → I pay G (1) from my inventory  \n\n- For their path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  - (1,0): R → they need R → I give them R (1)  \n  - (1,1): R → I give them R (1)  \n  - (1,2): R → I give them R (1)  \n  - (2,2): R → I give them R (1)  \n  - (3,2): R → I give them R (1)  \n  - (3,3): G → they have G (2) → they can pay G (1) themselves  \n\nSo I need to pay R (1) at (2,3), and give R (5) to them for their path.\n\nBut that’s R (6) total — I only have R (14), so possible, but I lose 6 R.\n\nBut I gain B (4) from them — B (4) is worth 5 chips each — so 4 × 5 = 20 points extra in final score? No — each chip is worth 5 points at the end.\n\nSo gaining B (4) gives me 4 × 5 = 20 points if I keep them.\n\nBut if I don’t use them, I can keep them.\n\nAfter contract:\n- I give R (5) to them (for their path)\n- I lose R (5) but gain B (4)\n- I still use R (1) at (2,3), so total R used = 6\n- I have R (14) - R (6) = R (8) left\n- B (0) + B (4) = B (4)\n- G (2) - G (1) = G (1) used at (3,3)\n- So final chips: R (8), B (4), G (1)\n- Total chips: 13\n- Score: 20 + 5×13 = 20 + 65 = 85\n\nNow, what if I don't trade?  \nI can take the same path and pay B (4) at the four B tiles — but I have 0 B, so I can't.\n\nI cannot take the path without trading.\n\nSo I must trade.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nWhat if I only trade for B (4) – no need to give them R (5)?\n\nBut they need R (5) to reach goal — if I don't give it, they can't reach (3,3), and they fail.\n\nBut I don't care if they fail — but if they don't reach, I get no score at all? No — my score only depends on me reaching goal.\n\nBut the game ends when both players move, but as long as I reach goal, I get 20 + 5*chips.\n\nBut if they don't reach, they get 0, but I still get my 20.\n\nBut can I bait them?\n\nNo — because I need them to give me B (4) — if they don't, I can't move to (0,1), (0,2), etc.\n\nSo I must propose a deal.\n\nBut if I give them R (5), I get B (4).\n\nIs that fair?\n\nLet’s calculate my score if I give R (5) and receive B (4):\n\n- I used R (1) for my move to (2,3)\n- I used G (1) for (3,3)\n- I gave R (5) to them\n- So net R used: 6\n- R left: 14 - 6 = 8\n- B: 0 + 4 = 4\n- G: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Total chips: 13\n- Score: 20 + 5×13 = 85\n\nIf I don't trade, I cannot move — so score 0.\n\nSo 85 > 0 → I gain.\n\nBut can I trade for less?\n\nSuppose I only give them R (4), and they give me B (4) — but they need R (5), so they can't reach goal.\n\nBut I don't care — but if they don't reach, they may not cooperate — but I only care about me.\n\nBut the game probably requires both to reach goal? No — the scoring is independent.\n\nBut if they don’t reach, they get 0, but I still get my score.\n\nBut can I force them to give me B (4) without giving them R (5)?\n\nNo — because they have no incentive to help me if I don't help them.\n\nBut I don't care about them — so I could just say: I give you nothing, give me B (4), and I’ll use my own R (1) and G (1).\n\nBut they won’t agree — because they need R (5) to survive, and I have none.\n\nSo I must offer R (5).\n\nBut what if I offer to give them fewer R?\n\nSuppose I offer only R (3) for B (4).\n\nThen they still need R (2) more — they can't reach.\n\nSo they might reject.\n\nBut if they reject, I can't move — so I get 0.\n\nSo they might accept R (3) if it helps them reach, but they can't.\n\nSo they need R (5).\n\nSo the only way they go is if I give them R (5).\n\nSo I must give R (5).\n\nAnd I receive B (4).\n\nSo it’s a necessary trade.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- (0,1): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,2): You give me B (1)  \n- (0,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (1,3): You give me B (1)  \n- (1,0): I give you R (1)  \n- (1,1): I give you R (1)  \n- (1,2): I give you R (1)  \n- (2,2): I give you R (1)  \n- (3,2): I give you R (1)  \n\n(3,3) is covered: I pay G (1), they pay G (1) — but I don’t need to trade G.\n\nHence, the contract is complete.\n\nThis allows:\n- I receive B (4) — can move on B tiles\n- I give R (5) — they can use it for their path\n- I pay R (1) at (2,3) — I have R (14), so fine\n- I pay G (1) at (3,3) — have it\n\nFinal chips after: R (14 - 6 = 8), B (4), G (1) → total 13 → score 20 + 65 = 85\n\nIf I don’t trade, I can’t move — score 0.\n\nSo I am strictly better off.\n\nI will now send the contract.\n\nFinal proposal:\n\n(0,1): You give me B (1)  \n(0,2): You give me B (1)  \n(0,3): You give me B (1)  \n(1,3): You give me B (1)  \n(1,0): I give you R (1)  \n(1,1): I give you R (1)  \n(1,2): I give you R (1)  \n(2,2): I give you R (1)  \n(3,2): I give you R (1)  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (0,1): You give me B (1)  \n(0,2): You give me B (1)  \n(0,3): You give me B (1)  \n(1,3): You give me B (1)  \n(1,0): I give you R (1)  \n(1,1): I give you R (1)  \n(1,2): I give you R (1)  \n(2,2): I give you R (1)  \n(3,2): I give you R (1)  \n\nagree \n",
