Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

But I don’t *need* to — I can reach goal alone using my own chips.\n\nNow look at other player:  \nThey have R:0, so cannot use any R-path.  \nTheir best path? Likely:  \n(0,0) G → (0,1) R → but they have 0 R → they cannot move to (0,1).  \nSo they must avoid R tiles.\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (1,0) R → no, they have no R.  \n(0,0) G → (0,1) R → no R, cannot go.  \n(0,0) G → (0,1) → invalid? Only way forward: down to (1,0). But (1,0) is R → they have no R → cannot pay.\n\nSo unless they trade, they **cannot move at all**.\n\nBut they are at (0,0) — the G tile → no cost to stay. But to move, they must pay 1 chip of the tile's colour.\n\nSo they cannot move to (0,1) (R), cannot move to (1,0) (R) — both require R.\n\nTheir only possible moves: none. They are stuck.\n\nTherefore, **they cannot reach their goal unless I help them**, either by **trading** or **letting them use my chips** — but I cannot let them use chips without trading.\n\nWait: they have B:14, G:2.  \nCan they take a path using B and G?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → invalid (no R)  \n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → invalid (no R)\n\nDead end. So no valid path unless they get R.\n\nThus, the only way for them to reach goal is to **trade for R chips**.\n\nThey need R chips to move.\n\nI have 14 R, no B, little G.\n\nThey have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nSo I can trade R → B or R → G.\n\nBut **they cannot move unless they get R**.\n\nSo they depend on **me** to give them R chips.\n\nI can reach my goal alone, using only my own chips.\n\nSo I have all the leverage.\n\nThus: they must trade with me to move.\n\nBut I can achieve 70 points on my own.\n\nIf I help them, I will get some points from them **in return** — but I must be strictly better off.\n\nSo I must set a contract where I give **less than 70** points to them, but still get **more than 70** in return.\n\nBut I get 20 points if I reach goal, plus 5 per chip remaining.\n\nIf I help them, I must spend some R chips on them.\n\nSuppose I give them 5 R chips in exchange for 2 B and 1 G (for example).\n\nBut they need R to move.\n\nBut: I must **help them move**, so they can reach goal.\n\nBut the cost is: I must give up R chips.\n\nSuppose I give them 5 R chips.\n\nThen"

They are completely dependent on me to trade them R chips so they can progress.\n\nHowever, I have no incentive to help them unless I receive more than 70 points in return — but the maximum I can receive is 20 (from them reaching their goal) plus 5 points per chip they give me, *if I accept a trade*.\n\nBut I can already get 70 points by going alone.\n\nSo to make cooperation beneficial for me, I would need to receive **more than 70** points from them via the contract.\n\nBut they can only give me up to 20 points (if they reach goal) — I can't get 50 more from chips unless they give me a large number of chips.\n\nBut if I help them reach goal, I might **lose** R chips in trade, which reduces my final chip count and thus final score.\n\nFor example:  \n- If I give them 5 R chips to help them move, I start with 14 R → 9 R left.  \n- If I reach goal alone: 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → 50 points from chips → 70 total.  \n- If I help them: I give 5 R → I have 9 R, 2 G → same as before?

But I used 5 R in trade, so I need to get something back.\n\nThe trade is **equal value**? But they need R to move; I have R. So I can trade R for their B or G.\n\nSuppose I trade 5 R for 5 B (from them). Then I now have:  \n- R: 9  \n- G: 2  \n- B: 5\n\nBut I still need to use my own chips to reach goal.\n\nMy path: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → (0,2) R → (1,2) R → (2,2) R → (2,3) R → (3,3) G  \nThat requires: 5 R and 1 G → yes, I have that.\n\nSo I can still go this path.\n\nBut now I have **5 extra B chips**, which don't help me, but I can keep them — they still count toward score.\n\nAfter using 5 R and 1 G, I have: 9 R, 1 G, 5 B → total chips: 15 → score = 20 + 5×15 = 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nBut wait — I didn’t use any B chips in my path. But I still have them — and they count.\n\nSo by trading 5 R for 5 B **before** moving, I now have 15 chips at the end.\n\nBut the trade is only beneficial if I get **more chips** in return.\n\nBut I traded 5 R for 5 B — same number of chips.\n\nBut I can get more B or G?\n\nThey have: 14 B, 2 G.\n\nI can trade for 5 B and 1 G, for example.\n\nBut they may not agree.\n\nBut crucially: I **don’t need to trade** to reach goal.\n\nIf I trade 5 R for 5 B, I end up with: 9 R, 2 G, 5 B → 16 chips → score: 20 + 5×16 = 20 + 80 = 100.\n\nWait — that’s better.\n\nBut I used 5 R to trade → I had 14 R → now 9 R → still enough for my path.\n\nAnd I still have 2 G — my path uses 1 G → so I have 1 G left.\n\nAnd I got 5 B → so total chips at end: 9 R + 1 G + 5 B = 15 → 75"

Or not?\n\nBut if I help them, I might lose more than I gain.\n\nNo — in this case, by giving them 5 R, I gain 5 B (extra chips), so net win.\n\nAnd I still have enough R to move.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n\"I will give you 5 red chips for 5 blue chips. In return, I will ensure you can move toward your goal. If you reach your goal, I will give you 10 points. If I reach my goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nBut I need to maximize my score.\n\nSince I can get 95 points by trading 5 R for 5 B **and going alone**, and **they cannot move without R**, I can set the price high.\n\nBut they have no choice.\n\nSo let's think: I can offer to give them R (to move)"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Only way forward: down to (1,0). But (1,0) is R → they have no R → cannot pay.\n\nSo unless they trade, they **cannot move at all**.\n\nBut they are at (0,0) — the G tile → no cost to stay. But to move, they must pay 1 chip of the tile's colour.\n\nSo they cannot move to (0,1) (R), cannot move to (1,0) (R) — both require R.\n\nTheir only possible moves: none. They are stuck.\n\nTherefore, **they cannot reach their goal unless I help them**, either by **trading** or **letting them use my chips** — but I cannot let them use chips without trading.\n\nWait: they have B:14, G:2.  \nCan they take a path using B and G?\n\nTry: (0,0) G → (0,1) R → invalid (no R)  \n(0,0) G → (1,0) R → invalid (no R)\n\nDead end. So no valid path unless they get R.\n\nThus, the only way for them to reach goal is to **trade for R chips**.\n\nThey need R chips to move.\n\nI have 14 R, no B, little G.\n\nThey have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nSo I can trade R → B or R → G.\n\nBut **they cannot move unless they get R**.\n\nSo they depend on **me** to give them R chips.\n\nI can reach my goal alone, using only my own chips.\n\nSo I have all the leverage.\n\nThus: they must trade with me to move.\n\nBut I can achieve 70 points on my own.\n\nIf I help them, I will get some points from them **in return** — but I must be strictly better off.\n\nSo I must set a contract where I give **less than 70** points to them, but still get **more than 70** in return.\n\nBut I get 20 points if I reach goal, plus 5 per chip remaining.\n\nIf I help them, I must spend some R chips on them.\n\nSuppose I give them 5 R chips in exchange for 2 B and 1 G (for example).\n\nBut they need R to move.\n\nBut: I must **help them move**, so they can reach goal.\n\nBut the cost is: I must give up R chips.\n\nSuppose I give them 5 R chips.\n\nThen"

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
