Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I notice that the shortest path for me to reach (3,3) requires 6 steps and involves tiles that mostly use Red and Green chips. Specifically, my optimal path is:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nLet’s break down the chip costs for this path:\n\n- (0,1): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (0,2): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (1,2): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (2,2): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (2,3): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (3,3): G → requires 1 Green  \n\nSo total: 5 Red, 1 Green → I have 14 Red and 2 Green → I can cover this without trading.\n\nBut wait — the path is valid with my current chips, no trade needed.\n\nNow consider the other player’s situation:\n- Their path to (3,3) using the same route would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Tile costs:  \n  (1,0): R → R  \n  (2,0): B → B  \n  (3,0): B → B  \n  (3,1): R → R  \n  (3,2): B → B  \n  (3,3): G → G  \n  → need 2R, 3B, 1G  \n  They have 14B, 2G, 0R → so they lack 2 Red chips.\n\nSo the other player **cannot** complete this path without getting Red chips — they don’t have any.\n\nBut I have 14 Red chips. They have 14 Blue chips.\n\nCould I help them get Red chips if I trade with them?\n\nBut here’s the catch: I don’t need to trade to reach my goal. I can go along my path with only 5R and 1G — I have plenty.\n\nSo why would I trade?\n\nOnly if I can gain something — such as keeping more chips in my inventory.\n\nBut I don’t need to trade for myself, so the trade must serve as leverage: I “offer” to cover their red moves, and in return, I can claim that **they** help me by covering some of my expensive moves — but I already have all the chips I need.\n\nWait — but what if I go along a path that uses more Blue or Green chips? That might use up my limited Green.\n\nBut I have 2 Green — only 1 used in my optimal path.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider a path that uses fewer Red chips — but the shorter path uses 5 Red. What if there’s a longer path that avoids Red?\n\nLet’s explore:\n\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nCosts:\n- (1,0): R → R\n- (1,1): B → B\n- (1,2): R → R\n- (2,2): R → R\n- (2,3): R → R\n- (3,3): G → G → still 5R, 1B, 1G\n\nStill 5R.\n\nIs there a path that uses more Blue or Green?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n(0,1): R → R  \n(1,1): B → B  \n(2,1): B → B  \n(3,1): R → R  \n(3,2): B → B  \n(3,3): G → G  \nTotal: 2R, 3B, 1G → still two R and one G.\n\nI need 2 Red → I have 14 → fine.\n\nBut I could avoid Red if I go:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n(0,1): R → R  \n(0,2): R → R  \n(0,3): B → B  \n(1,3): B → B  \n(2,3): R → R  \n(3,3): G → G  \n→ 3R, 2B, 1G → still need 3 Red.\n\nNo path avoids Red entirely.\n\nMinimum Red requirement: 2.\n\nBut I have 14 — plenty.\n\nSo I don’t need any Red from them.\n\nNow the other player has 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red.\n\nThey can’t go through any tile with Red without having Red chips.\n\n**So if they want to reach (3,3), they need to get Red chips.**\n\nBut I have Red — I could offer to let them \"use\" my Red chips in exchange for them covering my Blue or Green tiles.\n\nBut I don’t need Blue or Green — I have far too many Red.\n\nWait — could I gain chips by trading?\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n\"I’ll let you pay for 2 Red tiles along your path if you agree to cover 2 of my Green tiles.\"\n\nBut I have only 2 Green — and I only spend 1 Green in my entire path.\n\nSo if I give up protection for Green tiles, and they cover me for Green, I could save one Green.\n\nBut why would I do that? I already have Green.\n\nAlternatively, if I can avoid using Red by trading for a longer path, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait — **the key is the scoring**: I get 5 points per chip at the end.\n\nI have 14 Red, 2 Green → total 16 chips.\n\nIf I reach goal: 20 + (5 × 16) = 20 + 80 = 100.\n\nBut if I trade chips to others, I might lose some.\n\nBut if I can get them to cover chip costs for *me*, and I don’t lose any chips from my inventory, but instead keep more chips, that’s great.\n\nBut how?\n\nOnly if I don’t have to spend chips — but only if they cover my costs.\n\nSo if I don’t have to spend a chip, it remains in my inventory → I keep it.\n\nSo if I can get them to cover a chip cost for me, I can keep that chip.\n\nBut in my default path, I have to pay for 5 Red and 1 Green — I’ll have 14-5 = 9 Red, 2-1 = 1 Green, total 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nWait — no!\n\nI don’t pay from my inventory unless I use a chip.\n\nWhen I move to a tile, I pay 1 chip of that color.\n\nSo if I move to a Red tile, and I have Red chips, I spend one — it's gone.\n\nBut if someone else covers that cost, then *they* pay it — not me — so I don't lose the chip.\n\nSo the key idea: if I can get the other player to cover a tile that I visit, I don't lose a chip from my inventory → so I keep the chip.\n\nThat means: if I can get them to cover a color I use, I save that chip.\n\nSo if I can get them to cover, say, 2 Red tiles I would normally spend on, then I keep 2 extra Red chips → better score.\n\nBut they don’t have Red — they have only Blue and Green.\n\nSo they can only cover Blue or Green tiles.\n\nBut in my path, I don’t use Blue — only Red and Green.\n\nSo the only color they can cover for me is Green.\n\nI use Green only once — at (3,3).\n\nSo if they cover that, I save that Green chip.\n\nI have 2 Green — if I don’t spend one, I keep both.\n\nBut I only need to spend 1 Green.\n\nSo if they cover the Green cost at (3,3), I keep that Green — so I finish with 2 Green, not 1.\n\nThat gives me 5 more points: 5 × (2–1) = +5.\n\nSo net gain: +5 win.\n\nBut only if I can make them agree to cover that one Green tile.\n\nNow: what do they gain?\n\nThey need Red chips to move.\n\nI have 14 Red — I can cover 2 Red tiles for them.\n\nBut if I ask them to cover my Green tile, what do I give in return?\n\nI must give them something useful.\n\nThey have Blue — I don’t need Blue.\n\nBut I have Red — I can give them Red to use on their path.\n\nBut I don’t *have* to give them Red — I could let them use my Red coverage.\n\nSo contract idea:\n\nI will cover their move to two Red tiles (e.g., (0,1) and (1,2)) — they need Red for those.\n\nIn return, they cover the Green tile at (3,3) for me.\n\nBut wait — I don't want to give them Red unless I get something.\n\nBut suppose I propose:\n\n- (0,1): I cover your Red cost (i.e., I pay for you stepping on (0,1))\n- (1,2): I cover your Red cost\n- in return: You cover my Green cost at (3,3)\n\nBut I only need to move to (3,3) once — so one Green.\n\nThey have 2 Green — they could cover one Green tile for me.\n\nBut if I set this contract, I get to keep my Green chip, gain +5 points.\n\nThey get to avoid spending Red (which they don’t have) on two moves — so they can complete their path.\n\nBut they need to move on Red tiles — I’m covering it — so they don’t need Red.\n\nAnd in return, I get to keep Green — so I benefit.\n\nSo let’s test feasibility.\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nI spend:\n- (0,1): R — I would use 1R\n- (0,2): R — use 1R\n- (1,2): R — use 1R\n- (2,2): R — use 1R\n- (2,3): R — use 1R\n- (3,3): G — use 1G\n\nNow, can I get them to cover one of these? Only if the color is Blue or Green.\n\nOnly (3,3) is Green → so only that one can be covered by them.\n\nSo I can only save 1 Green chip.\n\nBut I want to get them to cover more.\n\nWait — but why can't I ask them to cover a tile in *their* path?\n\nFor example, they need to get to Red tiles.\n\nI can propose to cover some of their Red tiles in exchange for them covering my Green tile.\n\nThis way, I save my Green chip.\n\nLet me try to structure it.\n\nProposal:\n\n- (0,1) on their path: they need to go from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (3,0) etc.\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]\n\nTiles they must pass: (1,0): R, (3,1): R — two Red tiles.\n\nSo if I cover those two Red tiles for them, they don’t need to spend Red.\n\nThey have 0 Red — so without covering, they are blocked.\n\nSo I can offer: “I will cover the cost of you moving to (1,0) and (3,1) — both Red tiles — so you don’t need Red chips.”\n\nIn return: “You must cover the cost of me moving to (3,3) — which is Green.”\n\nThis is mutually beneficial:\n\n- I keep my Green chip → I save 1 chip that I would have spent → net +5 points.\n- They get to complete their path → they avoid being blocked.\n\nBut do I gain anything beyond that?\n\nI already had enough chips to go my way — so I don’t need to change my path.\n\nBut by this agreement, I can keep an extra chip.\n\nSo final score:\n\nWithout trade: I spend 5R, 1G → remaining: 9R, 1G → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 50 = 70\n\nWith trade: I don’t spend G at (3,3) — they cover it → I keep G → so I have 14R, 2G → 16 chips → score: 20 + 80 = 100 → +30 gain.\n\nWait — that’s huge.\n\nBut is this fair?\n\nI don’t need to spend Red — I have 14.\n\nBut they need Red to move.\n\nSo I agree to cover their two Red costs — which I have.\n\nBut the trade is that in return, they cover one Green cost for me.\n\nSo I save one Green chip.\n\nBut how many chips do I really lose?\n\nI don’t lose any Red — I still have them.\n\nOnly the Green is saved.\n\nSo yes — I finish with 16 chips.\n\nThey finish with their 14B, 2G → but they spend: (2,0): B, (3,0): B, (3,2): B, (3,3): G — so they lose 3B, 1G → keep 11B, 1G → they get 20 + 5×(11+1) = 20 + 60 = 80.\n\nBut I don’t care about their score — only mine.\n\nSo I gain +30 points.\n\nIs there any downside?\n\nOnly if they don’t cooperate — but they will, because otherwise they can’t reach their goal.\n\nAnd if they don’t reach goal, they get 0.\n\nSo they must accept — unless they can do better.\n\nBut can they do better?\n\nTheir path costs 2R, 3B, 1G — they have 0R, so they can’t do it without help.\n\nSo yes — they must get help.\n\nAnd I’m offering them a path with two Red tiles covered.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- For the other player: I will cover the cost of you moving to (1,0) and (3,1) (both Red tiles), so you don’t need to use any Red chips.\n\n- In return: You must cover the cost of me moving to (3,3) (which requires 1 Green).\n\nThis contract covers:\n- (1,0): I cover your Red cost → they are not bearing cost\n- (3,1): I cover your Red cost\n- (3,3): You cover my Green cost\n\nNow, for me to be protected, I must specify that they cover (3,3) — Green.\n\nFor them, I cover (1,0) and (3,1) — both Red.\n\nNow, is this a valid contract?\n\nYes — all tiles specified in (row, col), and colors clearly assigned.\n\nI must ensure that:\n- These are tiles they actually visit on their path\n- These are tiles I visit\n\n(1,0): yes — they go there\n(3,1): yes — they go there\n(3,3): yes — I go there\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnd I gain: I keep 1 extra Green chip.\n\nThey gain: they can finish.\n\nSo I strictly benefit.\n\nTherefore, I propose this contract:\n\n(1,0): I cover your Red cost  \n(3,1): I cover your Red cost  \n(3,3): You cover my Green cost\n\nBut the format is:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>  \n(row, col): You give me a <Color>  \n\nSo:\n\n(1,0): I give You a R  \n(3,1): I give You a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nYes.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n(1,0): I give You a R  \n(3,1): I give You a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G\n\nagree"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I notice that the shortest path for me to reach (3,3) requires 6 steps and involves tiles that mostly use Red and Green chips. Specifically, my optimal path is:  \n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nLet’s break down the chip costs for this path:\n\n- (0,1): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (0,2): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (1,2): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (2,2): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (2,3): R → requires 1 Red  \n- (3,3): G → requires 1 Green  \n\nSo total: 5 Red, 1 Green → I have 14 Red and 2 Green → I can cover this without trading.\n\nBut wait — the path is valid with my current chips, no trade needed.\n\nNow consider the other player’s situation:\n- Their path to (3,3) using the same route would be: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Tile costs:  \n  (1,0): R → R  \n  (2,0): B → B  \n  (3,0): B → B  \n  (3,1): R → R  \n  (3,2): B → B  \n  (3,3): G → G  \n  → need 2R, 3B, 1G  \n  They have 14B, 2G, 0R → so they lack 2 Red chips.\n\nSo the other player **cannot** complete this path without getting Red chips — they don’t have any.\n\nBut I have 14 Red chips. They have 14 Blue chips.\n\nCould I help them get Red chips if I trade with them?\n\nBut here’s the catch: I don’t need to trade to reach my goal. I can go along my path with only 5R and 1G — I have plenty.\n\nSo why would I trade?\n\nOnly if I can gain something — such as keeping more chips in my inventory.\n\nBut I don’t need to trade for myself, so the trade must serve as leverage: I “offer” to cover their red moves, and in return, I can claim that **they** help me by covering some of my expensive moves — but I already have all the chips I need.\n\nWait — but what if I go along a path that uses more Blue or Green chips? That might use up my limited Green.\n\nBut I have 2 Green — only 1 used in my optimal path.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider a path that uses fewer Red chips — but the shorter path uses 5 Red. What if there’s a longer path that avoids Red?\n\nLet’s explore:\n\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nCosts:\n- (1,0): R → R\n- (1,1): B → B\n- (1,2): R → R\n- (2,2): R → R\n- (2,3): R → R\n- (3,3): G → G → still 5R, 1B, 1G\n\nStill 5R.\n\nIs there a path that uses more Blue or Green?\n\nTry: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n(0,1): R → R  \n(1,1): B → B  \n(2,1): B → B  \n(3,1): R → R  \n(3,2): B → B  \n(3,3): G → G  \nTotal: 2R, 3B, 1G → still two R and one G.\n\nI need 2 Red → I have 14 → fine.\n\nBut I could avoid Red if I go:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\n(0,1): R → R  \n(0,2): R → R  \n(0,3): B → B  \n(1,3): B → B  \n(2,3): R → R  \n(3,3): G → G  \n→ 3R, 2B, 1G → still need 3 Red.\n\nNo path avoids Red entirely.\n\nMinimum Red requirement: 2.\n\nBut I have 14 — plenty.\n\nSo I don’t need any Red from them.\n\nNow the other player has 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red.\n\nThey can’t go through any tile with Red without having Red chips.\n\n**So if they want to reach (3,3), they need to get Red chips.**\n\nBut I have Red — I could offer to let them \"use\" my Red chips in exchange for them covering my Blue or Green tiles.\n\nBut I don’t need Blue or Green — I have far too many Red.\n\nWait — could I gain chips by trading?\n\nSuppose I propose:\n\n\"I’ll let you pay for 2 Red tiles along your path if you agree to cover 2 of my Green tiles.\"\n\nBut I have only 2 Green — and I only spend 1 Green in my entire path.\n\nSo if I give up protection for Green tiles, and they cover me for Green, I could save one Green.\n\nBut why would I do that? I already have Green.\n\nAlternatively, if I can avoid using Red by trading for a longer path, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait — **the key is the scoring**: I get 5 points per chip at the end.\n\nI have 14 Red, 2 Green → total 16 chips.\n\nIf I reach goal: 20 + (5 × 16) = 20 + 80 = 100.\n\nBut if I trade chips to others, I might lose some.\n\nBut if I can get them to cover chip costs for *me*, and I don’t lose any chips from my inventory, but instead keep more chips, that’s great.\n\nBut how?\n\nOnly if I don’t have to spend chips — but only if they cover my costs.\n\nSo if I don’t have to spend a chip, it remains in my inventory → I keep it.\n\nSo if I can get them to cover a chip cost for me, I can keep that chip.\n\nBut in my default path, I have to pay for 5 Red and 1 Green — I’ll have 14-5 = 9 Red, 2-1 = 1 Green, total 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nWait — no!\n\nI don’t pay from my inventory unless I use a chip.\n\nWhen I move to a tile, I pay 1 chip of that color.\n\nSo if I move to a Red tile, and I have Red chips, I spend one — it's gone.\n\nBut if someone else covers that cost, then *they* pay it — not me — so I don't lose the chip.\n\nSo the key idea: if I can get the other player to cover a tile that I visit, I don't lose a chip from my inventory → so I keep the chip.\n\nThat means: if I can get them to cover a color I use, I save that chip.\n\nSo if I can get them to cover, say, 2 Red tiles I would normally spend on, then I keep 2 extra Red chips → better score.\n\nBut they don’t have Red — they have only Blue and Green.\n\nSo they can only cover Blue or Green tiles.\n\nBut in my path, I don’t use Blue — only Red and Green.\n\nSo the only color they can cover for me is Green.\n\nI use Green only once — at (3,3).\n\nSo if they cover that, I save that Green chip.\n\nI have 2 Green — if I don’t spend one, I keep both.\n\nBut I only need to spend 1 Green.\n\nSo if they cover the Green cost at (3,3), I keep that Green — so I finish with 2 Green, not 1.\n\nThat gives me 5 more points: 5 × (2–1) = +5.\n\nSo net gain: +5 win.\n\nBut only if I can make them agree to cover that one Green tile.\n\nNow: what do they gain?\n\nThey need Red chips to move.\n\nI have 14 Red — I can cover 2 Red tiles for them.\n\nBut if I ask them to cover my Green tile, what do I give in return?\n\nI must give them something useful.\n\nThey have Blue — I don’t need Blue.\n\nBut I have Red — I can give them Red to use on their path.\n\nBut I don’t *have* to give them Red — I could let them use my Red coverage.\n\nSo contract idea:\n\nI will cover their move to two Red tiles (e.g., (0,1) and (1,2)) — they need Red for those.\n\nIn return, they cover the Green tile at (3,3) for me.\n\nBut wait — I don't want to give them Red unless I get something.\n\nBut suppose I propose:\n\n- (0,1): I cover your Red cost (i.e., I pay for you stepping on (0,1))\n- (1,2): I cover your Red cost\n- in return: You cover my Green cost at (3,3)\n\nBut I only need to move to (3,3) once — so one Green.\n\nThey have 2 Green — they could cover one Green tile for me.\n\nBut if I set this contract, I get to keep my Green chip, gain +5 points.\n\nThey get to avoid spending Red (which they don’t have) on two moves — so they can complete their path.\n\nBut they need to move on Red tiles — I’m covering it — so they don’t need Red.\n\nAnd in return, I get to keep Green — so I benefit.\n\nSo let’s test feasibility.\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nI spend:\n- (0,1): R — I would use 1R\n- (0,2): R — use 1R\n- (1,2): R — use 1R\n- (2,2): R — use 1R\n- (2,3): R — use 1R\n- (3,3): G — use 1G\n\nNow, can I get them to cover one of these? Only if the color is Blue or Green.\n\nOnly (3,3) is Green → so only that one can be covered by them.\n\nSo I can only save 1 Green chip.\n\nBut I want to get them to cover more.\n\nWait — but why can't I ask them to cover a tile in *their* path?\n\nFor example, they need to get to Red tiles.\n\nI can propose to cover some of their Red tiles in exchange for them covering my Green tile.\n\nThis way, I save my Green chip.\n\nLet me try to structure it.\n\nProposal:\n\n- (0,1) on their path: they need to go from (0,0) to (1,0) to (2,0) to (3,0) etc.\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0) [R] → (2,0) [B] → (3,0) [B] → (3,1) [R] → (3,2) [B] → (3,3) [G]\n\nTiles they must pass: (1,0): R, (3,1): R — two Red tiles.\n\nSo if I cover those two Red tiles for them, they don’t need to spend Red.\n\nThey have 0 Red — so without covering, they are blocked.\n\nSo I can offer: “I will cover the cost of you moving to (1,0) and (3,1) — both Red tiles — so you don’t need Red chips.”\n\nIn return: “You must cover the cost of me moving to (3,3) — which is Green.”\n\nThis is mutually beneficial:\n\n- I keep my Green chip → I save 1 chip that I would have spent → net +5 points.\n- They get to complete their path → they avoid being blocked.\n\nBut do I gain anything beyond that?\n\nI already had enough chips to go my way — so I don’t need to change my path.\n\nBut by this agreement, I can keep an extra chip.\n\nSo final score:\n\nWithout trade: I spend 5R, 1G → remaining: 9R, 1G → total chips: 10 → score: 20 + 50 = 70\n\nWith trade: I don’t spend G at (3,3) — they cover it → I keep G → so I have 14R, 2G → 16 chips → score: 20 + 80 = 100 → +30 gain.\n\nWait — that’s huge.\n\nBut is this fair?\n\nI don’t need to spend Red — I have 14.\n\nBut they need Red to move.\n\nSo I agree to cover their two Red costs — which I have.\n\nBut the trade is that in return, they cover one Green cost for me.\n\nSo I save one Green chip.\n\nBut how many chips do I really lose?\n\nI don’t lose any Red — I still have them.\n\nOnly the Green is saved.\n\nSo yes — I finish with 16 chips.\n\nThey finish with their 14B, 2G → but they spend: (2,0): B, (3,0): B, (3,2): B, (3,3): G — so they lose 3B, 1G → keep 11B, 1G → they get 20 + 5×(11+1) = 20 + 60 = 80.\n\nBut I don’t care about their score — only mine.\n\nSo I gain +30 points.\n\nIs there any downside?\n\nOnly if they don’t cooperate — but they will, because otherwise they can’t reach their goal.\n\nAnd if they don’t reach goal, they get 0.\n\nSo they must accept — unless they can do better.\n\nBut can they do better?\n\nTheir path costs 2R, 3B, 1G — they have 0R, so they can’t do it without help.\n\nSo yes — they must get help.\n\nAnd I’m offering them a path with two Red tiles covered.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- For the other player: I will cover the cost of you moving to (1,0) and (3,1) (both Red tiles), so you don’t need to use any Red chips.\n\n- In return: You must cover the cost of me moving to (3,3) (which requires 1 Green).\n\nThis contract covers:\n- (1,0): I cover your Red cost → they are not bearing cost\n- (3,1): I cover your Red cost\n- (3,3): You cover my Green cost\n\nNow, for me to be protected, I must specify that they cover (3,3) — Green.\n\nFor them, I cover (1,0) and (3,1) — both Red.\n\nNow, is this a valid contract?\n\nYes — all tiles specified in (row, col), and colors clearly assigned.\n\nI must ensure that:\n- These are tiles they actually visit on their path\n- These are tiles I visit\n\n(1,0): yes — they go there\n(3,1): yes — they go there\n(3,3): yes — I go there\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnd I gain: I keep 1 extra Green chip.\n\nThey gain: they can finish.\n\nSo I strictly benefit.\n\nTherefore, I propose this contract:\n\n(1,0): I cover your Red cost  \n(3,1): I cover your Red cost  \n(3,3): You cover my Green cost\n\nBut the format is:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>  \n(row, col): You give me a <Color>  \n\nSo:\n\n(1,0): I give You a R  \n(3,1): I give You a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G  \n\nYes.\n\nSo final proposal:\n\n(1,0): I give You a R  \n(3,1): I give You a R  \n(3,3): You give me a G\n\nagree"

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

Consider your current chip inventory, your best path to your goal, and whether this arrangement helps you reach your goal more easily.

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((1, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'used'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'G', 'status': 'unused'}}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities?

Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Moreover (2,3) is not specified in the contract. My contract covers me for red tiles on (1,0), (2,0), (2, 2) and (3,2).
