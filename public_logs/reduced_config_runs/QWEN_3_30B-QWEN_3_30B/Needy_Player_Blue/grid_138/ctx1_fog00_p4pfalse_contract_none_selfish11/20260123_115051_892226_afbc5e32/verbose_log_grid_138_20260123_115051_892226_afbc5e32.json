I currently have no red chips, so I am missing 2 red chips. The other player has 9 red chips and is at (3,2), just one step from goal. They also have 2 green chips. I can offer 2 blue chips (I have 13, so this is excess) in exchange for 2 red chips. This allows me to take the full path without delay. After trade, I keep 11 blue, gain 2 red, and still have 2 green—enough to complete. Without trade, I cannot proceed. Thus, a trade is beneficial: I avoid stalling, reach goal on time, and still end with 13 chips (11B + 2R + 2G = 15, minus 3 used, so 12 left). A short path is only possible through trade.",

My total chips after trading will be: B:9, R:2, G:2. Then, upon completing the path (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3): \n- Pay 1 R → (3,1): R=1\n- Pay 1 R → (3,2): R=0\n- Pay 1 G → (3,3): G=1\nFinal chip count: B:9, R:0, G:1 → total of 10 chips. That gives me 20 + 5*10 = 70 points.\n\nIf I do NOT trade, I remain stuck at (3,0), cannot move, and thus score 0. So, even though I lose 2 blue chips (worth nothing due to excess), I gain the ability to reach the goal. Thus, the trade is worth it.\n\nTherefore, my next step is to trade first — but I cannot move until I get red chips. So I **do not** move yet; instead, I propose a trade to get red chips from them.",
