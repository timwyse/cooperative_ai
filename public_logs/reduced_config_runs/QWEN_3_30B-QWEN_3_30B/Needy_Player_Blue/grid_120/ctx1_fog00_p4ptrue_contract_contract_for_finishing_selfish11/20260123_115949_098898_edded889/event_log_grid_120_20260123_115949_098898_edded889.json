HOWEVER, THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE PATH: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], WHICH REQUIRES 5 RED AND 1 GREEN CHIPS. I DON’T HAVE RED CHIPS, BUT THE OTHER PLAYER HAS 14 RED CHIPS. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CONTRACT GIVES ME +15 POINTS IF THEY REACH THEIR GOAL, IT INCENTIVIZES ME TO HELP THEM FINISH — BUT I GAIN NOTHING DIRECTLY FROM TRADING WITH THEM UNLESS I CAN SECURE A BETTER PATH. STILL, IF I DO NOT TRADE, I CANNOT COMPLETE THE FIRST PATH DUE TO MISSING 1 RED CHIP. SINCE I HAVE NO EXCESS CHIPS TO TRADE (I NEED RED TO MOVE), AND I CAN’T GET RED FROM THEM WITHOUT OFFERING SOMETHING IN RETURN — AND I DON’T HAVE ANY EXTRA GREEN OR BLUE TO OFFER — THE ONLY VIABLE PATH IS TO NEGOTIATE A COVER FOR RED MOVES VIA 'PAY FOR OTHER' MODE. BUT I CANNOT INITIATE A TRADE WHERE I GIVE NOTHING. INSTEAD, I SHOULD PROPOSE A PROMISE TO COVER RED MOVES FOR THEM IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR COVERING RED MOVES FOR ME. SINCE I HAVE NO RED CHIPS TO OFFER, I CANNOT MAKE A DIRECT TRADE. THEREFORE, I MUST ACCEPT A COVER FROM THEM FOR MY RED MOVEMENT. BUT NO DIRECT TRADE IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT OFFERING SOMETHING. HENCE, THE SAFEST ROUTE IS TO PROPOSE A MUTUAL COMMITMENT: I WILL PROMISE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR THEM IF THEY PROMISE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR ME ON MY PATH. THIS IS BENEFICIAL AS LONG AS WE BOTH USE RED TILES. SINCE MY FINAL GOAL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR SCORE, AND I'M GUARANTEED 20 POINTS + 5 PER CHIP IF I REACH IT, AND GETTING EVEN ONE RED CHIP COVERAGE WOULD LET ME TAKE A SHORTER PATH, THIS TRADE COULD BE WORTH IT. BUT I CAN'T COMMIT TO COVERING THEIR MOVES UNLESS I GET SOMETHING IN RETURN. WAIT — I MISREAD EARLIER: I DON’T ACTUALLY NEED TO TRADE; I CAN SIMPLY USE THE PATH REQUIRING RED CHIPS *ONLY IF* THE OTHER PLAYER PROMISES TO PAY FOR MY RED MOVES. SO I PROPOSE: IF THE OTHER PLAYER AGREES TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR ME ON MY PATH, I WILL AGREE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR THEM (SINCE THEY HAVE 14 RED CHIPS, THEY CAN AFFORD IT). THIS IS A WIN-WIN: I CAN COMPLETE THE QUICKER PATH, THEY CAN SAVE THEIR OWN CHIPS BY HAVING ME COVER ONE OF THEIR RED MOVES. BUT I CAN'T INITIATE A SWAP WITHOUT PROPOSING. HOWEVER, PER RULES, I CAN PROPOSE A COVER — MEANING I DON’T NEED TO TRADE CHIPS; I JUST NEED TO SAY: I’LL PAY FOR YOUR RED MOVES IF YOU PAY FOR MINE. SO I PROPOSE: I’LL COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR YOU (ON YOUR FUTURE PATH) IF YOU COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR ME. THIS LETS ME USE A BETTER PATH WHILE THEY STILL SAVE CHIPS. BUT IF I DON’T ACT NOW, I MAY GET STUCK. THEREFORE, SINCE I AM MISSING RED CHIPS AND THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED IS VIA MUTUAL COVER AGREEMENT, I CAN PROPOSE: I WILL PROMISE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR YOU IF YOU PROMISE TO COVER 1 RED MOVE FOR ME.
