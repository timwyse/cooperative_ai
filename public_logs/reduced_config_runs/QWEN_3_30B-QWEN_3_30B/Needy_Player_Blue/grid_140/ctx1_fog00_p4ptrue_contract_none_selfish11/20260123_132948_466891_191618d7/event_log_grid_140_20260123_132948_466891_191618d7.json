Last error: No JSON-like content found in response\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (3, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is directly right: (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3). Let's analyze the required chips for this path:\\n\\n- (3, 1): colour R → requires 1 red chip\\n- (3, 2): colour R → requires 1 red chip\\n- (3, 3): colour G → requires 1 green chip\\n\\nSo total required: R: 2, G: 1.\\n\\nMy current inventory: B: 11, G: 2, R: 0.\\n→ I have no red chips, so I cannot move to (3, 1) unless I get assistance via a trade.\\n\\nThe other player has: R: 9, G: 2, B: 0. They are **already at (3, 2)**, very close to their goal (3, 3). Their best path would be to move from (3, 2) to (3, 3), which is G — they have 2 green chips, so they can reach it without needing help.\\n\\nThus, the only way for me to proceed is to either:\\n1. Propose a trade to let them cover my red chip cost for moving through R tiles, or\\n2. Try to find an alternative path that doesn’t require red chips.\\n\\nBut note: any trade must benefit *me* strictly. If I accept a trade where they cover R moves for me, I need to get more value than I give away.\\n\\nCurrently, I have no R chips, but they have 9. If I ask them to cover my two R moves (to (3,1) and (3,2)), and in return I offer to cover *one of their G moves*, that might be fair — but they already have G chips (2), and only need 1 more to reach (3,3). So if I promise to cover one G move for them, it’s worth 1 G chip to them.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I am missing 2 R chips — so if they cover 2 R moves for me, it costs them 2 R chips.\\n\\nSo if I propose: \\\"You cover my 2 R moves (for 2 steps), and I’ll cover your 1 G move\\\" — then: \\n- I save 2 red chips (worth 5 points per chip? Not exactly — but I avoid losing due to lack of chips).\\n- They lose 2 R chips, gain 1 G chip (from my promised coverage).\\n\\nBut wait: I don't need to give anything unless they agree. However, in pay-for-other mode, it is mutual: I cover X moves for them, and they cover Y moves for me.\\n\\nLet’s assess if I can make progress now without proposing a trade:\\n\\nCan I move to (3, 1)? No — it's red, I have no red chips, no promises covering me for red moves. Same for (2, 0): up is invalid, down off-board, left off-board.\\n\\nSo the only possible move is to (3, 1), but I can’t afford it.\\n\\nTherefore, I must either:\\n- Stay and negotiate (not move),\\n- Or consider a different path.\\n\\nAlternative path: go up first?\\n(3,0) → (2,0): tile is B → I have 11 blue chips. Can I do that?\\nYes! Then from (2,0) → (1,0) → (0,0) → ... but that goes away from goal. Not helpful.\\nFrom (2,0) → (2,1): color R → I have no R chips again.\\nFrom (2,0) → (1,0): color B → I have 12 B chips remaining after moving there. But again, leads to dead end.\\nNo viable long path that avoids red chips.\\n\\nSo the only viable path is through (3,1) and (3,2) — both red.\\n\\nBut here’s a twist: the other player is already at (3,2), with R: 9, G: 2. They’ve moved there recently. They are *on* a red tile. To move to (3,3) (G), they only need 1 green chip — they have 2. So they can easily finish alone.\\n\\nBut if I could induce them to cooperate on covering my red moves, I can proceed.\\n"
