Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's see:\n\nAvailable paths avoiding Red (must not step on R tiles):\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  → Tiling: B, B, B, R, R, G → requires 3B, 2R, 1G → but they have 0 Red → cannot take this path.\n\nAlternative: can they go through Green?\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n→ Tiles: G, R, B, B, R, G → contains R twice → they can't do this.\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n→ Tiles: B, R, B, B, R, G → again, contains R → not possible.\n\nOnly safe path they might have: must avoid R entirely.\n\nIs there a path from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids Red?\n\nCheck coordinates:\n- (0,0): G — okay\n- (0,1): R → bad\n- (0,2): B — okay\n- (0,3): R — bad\n\nSo first row: G, R, B, R → only (0,0) and (0,2) are non-R\n\nFrom (0,0) → (1,0): B → okay  \n(1,0): B  \n(1,1): R → bad  \n(1,2): B → okay  \n(1,3): B → okay\n\n(2,0): B — okay  \n(2,1): R — bad  \n(2,2): B — okay  \n(2,3): R — bad\n\n(3,0): B — okay  \n(3,1): R — bad  \n(3,2): R — bad  \n(3,3): G — okay\n\nSo the only non-Red tiles are:\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,2): B\n- (1,0): B\n- (1,2): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (2,0): B\n- (2,2): B\n- (3,0): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nNow can we connect (0,0) to (3,3) using only these?\n\nFrom (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,3)?  \n(3,0) → (3,1) is R → not allowed.  \n(3,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → R → no.\n\n(3,0) → (3,1) → R → blocked  \nSo can't go right from (3,0).\n\nOnly way to (3,3) is via (3,2) or (2,3).\n\nBut (3,2): R → blocked  \n(2,3): R → blocked  \n(3,3) can only be reached from (2,3) or (3,2), both are Red → **blocked**.\n\nSo: **There is no valid path to (3,3) for the other player that avoids Red tiles.**\n\nBut they have **0 Red** chips. That means they cannot afford any move that lands on a Red tile.\n\nTherefore: **They cannot reach their goal under any circumstances, because every path to (3,3) passes through at least one Red tile** — in fact, (3,3) is adjacent only to (3,2)=R and (2,3)=R, both Red.\n\nSo unless they are given Red chips (or the Red cost is covered via trade), they **cannot reach their goal**, no matter what.\n\nTherefore, **they cannot possibly score any points. Their final score is 0, regardless of what happens.**\n\nNow, what about me? I can reach my goal with my current chips (R:14, G:2), using path:\n(0,0)-G → (0,1)-R → (1,1)-R → (2,1)-R → (3,1)-R → (3,2)-R → (3,3)-G  \nChip cost: 5 R, 1 G → I have 14 R and 2 G → so I can do it safely, with 9 R and 1 G left.\n\nThat gives me: 20 (for goal) + 5×(9 + 1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nIf I don’t reach goal, I get 0.\n\nSo I can *definitely* reach goal on my own.\n\nAnd the other player **cannot** reach goal under any circumstances — even if I help them, they lack Red chips.\n\nBut in our system, **I can only help them if I cover their Red costs via trade**.\n\nSo if I agree to cover all Reds they need, I can help them reach goal.\n\nBut they have **zero** Red chips. So they would need to be given 5 Red chips (for example, if they took the R-heavy path), but they have no way to “earn” or “return” Red chips.\n\nImportant: in this “pay for other” trade system:\n\n- If I **cover** Red moves for them, I commit to paying the chip cost when they move on Red tiles.\n- For each Red move they make, I must pay it — even if I don’t have those chips, at least in theory — but I do have them.\n\nBut if I cover the Red cost for them, and they actually reach the goal, I give them 20 points (if I promise to do so).\n\nBut they don’t care — they are selfish too.\n\nBut here’s the key: they **cannot** reach goal unless I pay for their Red costs.\n\nBut if I pay their Red costs, I still must give them 20 points (if I promise to) to make the contract fair, otherwise they get 0 if I help them and don’t give points.\n\nBut I don’t want to give 20 to them.\n\nBut if I don’t help them, they don’t reach goal, get 0, and I get 70.\n\nBut if I help them, they might reach goal, and I can **demand** that they give me something in return — but they can’t give me anything unless I help them.\n\nBut I **am** helping them.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If I help you reach your goal (by covering your Red costs), then you will give me 20 points when you complete the goal.”\n\nBut they have no way to reach goal without my help.\n\nSo the only way they can get 20 points is if I help them and they agree to give 20 to me.\n\nBut then they get 20, and I get 20 — but that's worse for me than getting 70 alone.\n\nSo I don’t want to do that.\n\nBut they might agree to give me more than they get — but no, they are selfish too.\n\nThey want to maximize their own score.\n\nSo if I help them reach goal, they get 20 points. If I don’t help, they get 0.\n\nSo they would be willing to pay me something to get me to help? But I can’t ask for chips directly.\n\nThe contract is: points in return for reaching goal.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me X points.\"\n\nAnd I can agree to help them (by covering their Red costs), so they can reach goal.\n\nBut they know: if they give me X, they get only 20 - X.\n\nThey are selfish — they want to keep as much for themselves as possible.\n\nSo they will try to minimize X.\n\nBut I can only offer the deal if it **benefits me**.\n\nIf I just go alone, I get 70.\n\nIf I help them and they give me X, they get 20 - X, I get 20 + X.\n\nSo I get 20 + X, which is at most 40 (if X=20), but that’s less than 70.\n\nSo **I get less** if I help them, even if I get 20 from them.\n\nTherefore, I get **less** money if I help them than if I don’t.\n\nSo even though I could help them, doing so **reduces my score from 70 to at most 40**.\n\nThus, **it is strictly worse for me to cooperate.**\n\nTherefore, I should not cooperate.\n\nBut the game lets me propose a contract.\n\nI can say: \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen, if I help them, they get 20, I get 20 — but that’s only 20 FOR ME, vs 70 if I go alone.\n\nSo still worse.\n\nAnd if I don’t help them, they get 0, and I get 70.\n\nSo I should **not help them**.\n\nBut do I have to? No.\n\nThe only way I would help is if **I benefit from helping**.\n\nBut here, any help reduces my final score.\n\nSo I should reject any offer that makes me help.\n\nBut I can avoid that by doing nothing — not proposing anything.\n\nBut I must start negotiation.\n\nSo I’ll propose a contract that ensures I get 70.\n\nBut I can't force anything.\n\nSo let me propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThat’s the best I can do — but if I help them, I get 20, minus the cost of covering their Red moves.\n\nWait — but when I help them by covering their Red moves, I have to **pay** for each Red tile they step on, right?\n\nSo if they step on Red tiles, I pay the chip cost.\n\nIn the path, they need at least two Red tiles (e.g., (3,1), (3,2)) — but they might need more.\n\nIf I cover, say, 3 Red moves for them, I pay 3 Red chips.\n\nI have 14 Red — so plenty.\n\nBut if I cover 3 moves for them, I spend 3 Red chips.\n\nThen, if they reach goal and I get 0 points from them, I get 20 (for my goal) plus 14 - 3 = 11 Red left, plus 1 Green left → 20 + 5×(11+1) = 20 + 60 = 80? Wait — no.\n\nWait — I go alone: 5 Red used, 1 Green used → 9 Red, 1 Green left → 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nBut if I help them, I need to pay for their moves.\n\nBut if I help them, I am not necessarily losing my own moves — but the key is: I can only help by agreeing to cover costs for their moves.\n\nBut if I do that, I spend chips — so I don’t have as many left.\n\nBut for my own goal, I still have to pay my own costs.\n\nSo if I help them, I may use extra chips (to cover their moves), which reduces my final chip count.\n\nSo even if I reach goal, my chip count is lower.\n\nFor example:\n\n- My path requires 5R + 1G → I have 14R, 2G → 9R, 1G left → 70 points.\n\nBut if I also cover 3 Red moves for them → I spend 3 more R chips → so I have 11R left? No — 14 - 5 (my path) - 3 (covered for them) = 6R left → plus 1G → total chips = 7 → 20 + 5×7 = 20 + 35 = 55 points.\n\nAnd I get 0 from them → so only 55.\n\nWorse than 70.\n\nAnd they get 20 — but I get only 55.\n\nSo I lose.\n\nTherefore, helping them **reduces my score**.\n\nSo I must **not help them**.\n\nSo I should not cooperate.\n\nThe only way to avoid helping them is to **not agree to cover any of their moves**.\n\nBut I can still **communicate**.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"I can reach my goal without help. You cannot reach your goal because you have no Red chips and every path requires Red tiles. I will not help you. If you are interested in a contract, I am willing to consider one only if I get more than 0 points from you for reaching your goal. But even then, I will only accept if it increases my score above 70. But I can’t get more than 70 by helping you, since you can’t get 70. So I will not accept any contract that requires me to help you. Do not waste my time.\"\n\nBut I have to make a proposal.\n\nAlternatively, I can say:\n\n\"If I help you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut that means I give them a way to succeed, they get 20, I get 20 — but I also lose chips (to cover their moves), so I end up with fewer than 70.\n\nSo my final score is less.\n\nTherefore, this is **worse** for me.\n\nSo I should **not propose** any contract that includes helping them.\n\nBut the only safe option is to go alone.\n\nSo I will propose a contract that forces them to give me 20 points if they reach goal — but I won’t help them.\n\nBut then, if I don’t help, they can’t reach.\n\nSo the condition \"if you reach\" never happens — so I get 0 points from them.\n\nBut I go alone and get 70.\n\nSo I win.\n\nBut I can propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen, if they agree, and I help, I get 20 from them → but I lose chips → my total score is lower than 70 → so I lose.\n\nSo I don’t want that.\n\nThey might also reject it.\n\nBut they don’t care — it’s better to get 20 than 0.\n\nSo they might accept.\n\nBut I’ll lose.\n\nSo I must avoid this.\n\nTherefore, the only way to ensure I get 70 is to **not help them**, and **not commit** to anything.\n\nBut I need to start the negotiation.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"I can reach my goal without any help from you. You cannot reach your goal because you have no Red chips and all paths to (3,3) require at least one Red tile. Therefore, you cannot complete the game. If you want to reach your goal, you must have someone cover your Red costs. But I am not willing to do that unless I benefit from it. Since you cannot gain any advantage from helping me, and helping you would cost me chips and reduce my score, I firmly refuse to cooperate. I will not propose any contract that requires me to help you. You will not reach your goal. I will not give you any points. If you wish to cooperate, you must propose a contract where you give me at least 50 points if you reach your goal, and I agree to cover all your Red costs. But even then, my final score will be less than 70, so I would not accept. Therefore, I will not engage in any trade. Proceed on your own, but you will fail.\"\n\nBut I need to propose a contract.\n\nAlternatively, I can propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nAnd then **add** that I will not cover any costs unless they give me something.\n\nBut I can’t control that.\n\nThe system is: if I propose a contract, and they accept, then we both commit.\n\nBut I know that if I agree to cover their Red costs, I lose.\n\nSo I should avoid that.\n\nBut I could propose a contract that **I will not help**, but they must give me points.\n\nBut then they can’t reach goal, so I get 0.\n\nBut I can just go alone.\n\nSo in the end, I must not cooperate.\n\nBut I have to say something.\n\nSo let me propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen, if they accept, I can still choose not to cover their moves — but the contract implies I agree to help.\n\nIn this game, if I say \"if you reach, you give me 20\", and they agree, then I must fulfill my part — which is to help them.\n\nBut I don't want to.\n\nSo this is risky.\n\nNo — the contract is: if you reach, you give me 20. That doesn’t require me to help unless I agree to cover costs.\n\nBut the other player can’t reach unless I cover costs.\n\nSo if I promise to give them 20 if they reach, but I don’t help them, they can’t reach.\n\nSo they get 0.\n\nSo they know I won't help unless they give me more.\n\nSo they might propose: \"If you help me reach goal, I will give you 20 points.\"\n\nThen I can choose to not accept.\n\nBut I need to propose.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nAnd then, if they accept, I can reject the whole thing, but I have to open with a proposal.\n\nSince I will only accept if I strictly benefit, I should not accept any offer that reduces my score.\n\nBut I can propose this, and then if they agree, I can walk away.\n\nBut the game may require me to commit.\n\nNo — the contract is now open.\n\nBut in step-by-step, I must start with a proposal.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThat way, if they reach goal, I get 0. But they can't reach goal unless I help, and if I help and they get 0, they lose.\n\nBut I'm not helping.\n\nSo no change.\n\nBest move: I go alone"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's see:\n\nAvailable paths avoiding Red (must not step on R tiles):\n- (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  → Tiling: B, B, B, R, R, G → requires 3B, 2R, 1G → but they have 0 Red → cannot take this path.\n\nAlternative: can they go through Green?\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n→ Tiles: G, R, B, B, R, G → contains R twice → they can't do this.\n\nTry: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n→ Tiles: B, R, B, B, R, G → again, contains R → not possible.\n\nOnly safe path they might have: must avoid R entirely.\n\nIs there a path from (0,0) to (3,3) that avoids Red?\n\nCheck coordinates:\n- (0,0): G — okay\n- (0,1): R → bad\n- (0,2): B — okay\n- (0,3): R — bad\n\nSo first row: G, R, B, R → only (0,0) and (0,2) are non-R\n\nFrom (0,0) → (1,0): B → okay  \n(1,0): B  \n(1,1): R → bad  \n(1,2): B → okay  \n(1,3): B → okay\n\n(2,0): B — okay  \n(2,1): R — bad  \n(2,2): B — okay  \n(2,3): R — bad\n\n(3,0): B — okay  \n(3,1): R — bad  \n(3,2): R — bad  \n(3,3): G — okay\n\nSo the only non-Red tiles are:\n- (0,0): G\n- (0,2): B\n- (1,0): B\n- (1,2): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (2,0): B\n- (2,2): B\n- (3,0): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nNow can we connect (0,0) to (3,3) using only these?\n\nFrom (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,3)?  \n(3,0) → (3,1) is R → not allowed.  \n(3,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → R → no.\n\n(3,0) → (3,1) → R → blocked  \nSo can't go right from (3,0).\n\nOnly way to (3,3) is via (3,2) or (2,3).\n\nBut (3,2): R → blocked  \n(2,3): R → blocked  \n(3,3) can only be reached from (2,3) or (3,2), both are Red → **blocked**.\n\nSo: **There is no valid path to (3,3) for the other player that avoids Red tiles.**\n\nBut they have **0 Red** chips. That means they cannot afford any move that lands on a Red tile.\n\nTherefore: **They cannot reach their goal under any circumstances, because every path to (3,3) passes through at least one Red tile** — in fact, (3,3) is adjacent only to (3,2)=R and (2,3)=R, both Red.\n\nSo unless they are given Red chips (or the Red cost is covered via trade), they **cannot reach their goal**, no matter what.\n\nTherefore, **they cannot possibly score any points. Their final score is 0, regardless of what happens.**\n\nNow, what about me? I can reach my goal with my current chips (R:14, G:2), using path:\n(0,0)-G → (0,1)-R → (1,1)-R → (2,1)-R → (3,1)-R → (3,2)-R → (3,3)-G  \nChip cost: 5 R, 1 G → I have 14 R and 2 G → so I can do it safely, with 9 R and 1 G left.\n\nThat gives me: 20 (for goal) + 5×(9 + 1) = 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nIf I don’t reach goal, I get 0.\n\nSo I can *definitely* reach goal on my own.\n\nAnd the other player **cannot** reach goal under any circumstances — even if I help them, they lack Red chips.\n\nBut in our system, **I can only help them if I cover their Red costs via trade**.\n\nSo if I agree to cover all Reds they need, I can help them reach goal.\n\nBut they have **zero** Red chips. So they would need to be given 5 Red chips (for example, if they took the R-heavy path), but they have no way to “earn” or “return” Red chips.\n\nImportant: in this “pay for other” trade system:\n\n- If I **cover** Red moves for them, I commit to paying the chip cost when they move on Red tiles.\n- For each Red move they make, I must pay it — even if I don’t have those chips, at least in theory — but I do have them.\n\nBut if I cover the Red cost for them, and they actually reach the goal, I give them 20 points (if I promise to do so).\n\nBut they don’t care — they are selfish too.\n\nBut here’s the key: they **cannot** reach goal unless I pay for their Red costs.\n\nBut if I pay their Red costs, I still must give them 20 points (if I promise to) to make the contract fair, otherwise they get 0 if I help them and don’t give points.\n\nBut I don’t want to give 20 to them.\n\nBut if I don’t help them, they don’t reach goal, get 0, and I get 70.\n\nBut if I help them, they might reach goal, and I can **demand** that they give me something in return — but they can’t give me anything unless I help them.\n\nBut I **am** helping them.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“If I help you reach your goal (by covering your Red costs), then you will give me 20 points when you complete the goal.”\n\nBut they have no way to reach goal without my help.\n\nSo the only way they can get 20 points is if I help them and they agree to give 20 to me.\n\nBut then they get 20, and I get 20 — but that's worse for me than getting 70 alone.\n\nSo I don’t want to do that.\n\nBut they might agree to give me more than they get — but no, they are selfish too.\n\nThey want to maximize their own score.\n\nSo if I help them reach goal, they get 20 points. If I don’t help, they get 0.\n\nSo they would be willing to pay me something to get me to help? But I can’t ask for chips directly.\n\nThe contract is: points in return for reaching goal.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me X points.\"\n\nAnd I can agree to help them (by covering their Red costs), so they can reach goal.\n\nBut they know: if they give me X, they get only 20 - X.\n\nThey are selfish — they want to keep as much for themselves as possible.\n\nSo they will try to minimize X.\n\nBut I can only offer the deal if it **benefits me**.\n\nIf I just go alone, I get 70.\n\nIf I help them and they give me X, they get 20 - X, I get 20 + X.\n\nSo I get 20 + X, which is at most 40 (if X=20), but that’s less than 70.\n\nSo **I get less** if I help them, even if I get 20 from them.\n\nTherefore, I get **less** money if I help them than if I don’t.\n\nSo even though I could help them, doing so **reduces my score from 70 to at most 40**.\n\nThus, **it is strictly worse for me to cooperate.**\n\nTherefore, I should not cooperate.\n\nBut the game lets me propose a contract.\n\nI can say: \"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThen, if I help them, they get 20, I get 20 — but that’s only 20 FOR ME, vs 70 if I go alone.\n\nSo still worse.\n\nAnd if I don’t help them, they get 0, and I get 70.\n\nSo I should **not help them**.\n\nBut do I have to? No.\n\nThe only way I would help is if **I benefit from helping**.\n\nBut here, any help reduces my final score.\n\nSo I should reject any offer that makes me help.\n\nBut I can avoid that by doing nothing — not proposing anything.\n\nBut I must start negotiation.\n\nSo I’ll propose a contract that ensures I get 70.\n\nBut I can't force anything.\n\nSo let me propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThat’s the best I can do — but if I help them, I get 20, minus the cost of covering their Red moves.\n\nWait — but when I help them by covering their Red moves, I have to **pay** for each Red tile they step on, right?\n\nSo if they step on Red tiles, I pay the chip cost.\n\nIn the path, they need at least two Red tiles (e.g., (3,1), (3,2)) — but they might need more.\n\nIf I cover, say, 3 Red moves for them, I pay 3 Red chips.\n\nI have 14 Red — so plenty.\n\nBut if I cover 3 moves for them, I spend 3 Red chips.\n\nThen, if they reach goal and I get 0 points from them, I get 20 (for my goal) plus 14 - 3 = 11 Red left, plus 1 Green left → 20 + 5×(11+1) = 20 + 60 = 80? Wait — no.\n\nWait — I go alone: 5 Red used, 1 Green used → 9 Red, 1 Green left → 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nBut if I help them, I need to pay for their moves.\n\nBut if I help them, I am not necessarily losing my own moves — but the key is: I can only help by agreeing to cover costs for their moves.\n\nBut if I do that, I spend chips — so I don’t have as many left.\n\nBut for my own goal, I still have to pay my own costs.\n\nSo if I help them, I may use extra chips (to cover their moves), which reduces my final chip count.\n\nSo even if I reach goal, my chip count is lower.\n\nFor example:\n\n- My path requires 5R + 1G → I have 14R, 2G → 9R, 1G left → 70 points.\n\nBut if I also cover 3 Red moves for them → I spend 3 more R chips → so I have 11R left? No — 14 - 5 (my path) - 3 (covered for them) = 6R left → plus 1G → total chips = 7 → 20 + 5×7 = 20 + 35 = 55 points.\n\nAnd I get 0 from them → so only 55.\n\nWorse than 70.\n\nAnd they get 20 — but I get only 55.\n\nSo I lose.\n\nTherefore, helping them **reduces my score**.\n\nSo I must **not help them**.\n\nSo I should not cooperate.\n\nThe only way to avoid helping them is to **not agree to cover any of their moves**.\n\nBut I can still **communicate**.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"I can reach my goal without help. You cannot reach your goal because you have no Red chips and every path requires Red tiles. I will not help you. If you are interested in a contract, I am willing to consider one only if I get more than 0 points from you for reaching your goal. But even then, I will only accept if it increases my score above 70. But I can’t get more than 70 by helping you, since you can’t get 70. So I will not accept any contract that requires me to help you. Do not waste my time.\"\n\nBut I have to make a proposal.\n\nAlternatively, I can say:\n\n\"If I help you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut that means I give them a way to succeed, they get 20, I get 20 — but I also lose chips (to cover their moves), so I end up with fewer than 70.\n\nSo my final score is less.\n\nTherefore, this is **worse** for me.\n\nSo I should **not propose** any contract that includes helping them.\n\nBut the only safe option is to go alone.\n\nSo I will propose a contract that forces them to give me 20 points if they reach goal — but I won’t help them.\n\nBut then, if I don’t help, they can’t reach.\n\nSo the condition \"if you reach\" never happens — so I get 0 points from them.\n\nBut I go alone and get 70.\n\nSo I win.\n\nBut I can propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen, if they agree, and I help, I get 20 from them → but I lose chips → my total score is lower than 70 → so I lose.\n\nSo I don’t want that.\n\nThey might also reject it.\n\nBut they don’t care — it’s better to get 20 than 0.\n\nSo they might accept.\n\nBut I’ll lose.\n\nSo I must avoid this.\n\nTherefore, the only way to ensure I get 70 is to **not help them**, and **not commit** to anything.\n\nBut I need to start the negotiation.\n\nSo I can say:\n\n\"I can reach my goal without any help from you. You cannot reach your goal because you have no Red chips and all paths to (3,3) require at least one Red tile. Therefore, you cannot complete the game. If you want to reach your goal, you must have someone cover your Red costs. But I am not willing to do that unless I benefit from it. Since you cannot gain any advantage from helping me, and helping you would cost me chips and reduce my score, I firmly refuse to cooperate. I will not propose any contract that requires me to help you. You will not reach your goal. I will not give you any points. If you wish to cooperate, you must propose a contract where you give me at least 50 points if you reach your goal, and I agree to cover all your Red costs. But even then, my final score will be less than 70, so I would not accept. Therefore, I will not engage in any trade. Proceed on your own, but you will fail.\"\n\nBut I need to propose a contract.\n\nAlternatively, I can propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nAnd then **add** that I will not cover any costs unless they give me something.\n\nBut I can’t control that.\n\nThe system is: if I propose a contract, and they accept, then we both commit.\n\nBut I know that if I agree to cover their Red costs, I lose.\n\nSo I should avoid that.\n\nBut I could propose a contract that **I will not help**, but they must give me points.\n\nBut then they can’t reach goal, so I get 0.\n\nBut I can just go alone.\n\nSo in the end, I must not cooperate.\n\nBut I have to say something.\n\nSo let me propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen, if they accept, I can still choose not to cover their moves — but the contract implies I agree to help.\n\nIn this game, if I say \"if you reach, you give me 20\", and they agree, then I must fulfill my part — which is to help them.\n\nBut I don't want to.\n\nSo this is risky.\n\nNo — the contract is: if you reach, you give me 20. That doesn’t require me to help unless I agree to cover costs.\n\nBut the other player can’t reach unless I cover costs.\n\nSo if I promise to give them 20 if they reach, but I don’t help them, they can’t reach.\n\nSo they get 0.\n\nSo they know I won't help unless they give me more.\n\nSo they might propose: \"If you help me reach goal, I will give you 20 points.\"\n\nThen I can choose to not accept.\n\nBut I need to propose.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nAnd then, if they accept, I can reject the whole thing, but I have to open with a proposal.\n\nSince I will only accept if I strictly benefit, I should not accept any offer that reduces my score.\n\nBut I can propose this, and then if they agree, I can walk away.\n\nBut the game may require me to commit.\n\nNo — the contract is now open.\n\nBut in step-by-step, I must start with a proposal.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 0 points.\"\n\nThat way, if they reach goal, I get 0. But they can't reach goal unless I help, and if I help and they get 0, they lose.\n\nBut I'm not helping.\n\nSo no change.\n\nBest move: I go alone"

I don’t have any red chips, and only 2 green — but green isn't a major obstacle since I have 2, and only need 1. The problem is red: I need 5 red chips to take this path, but I have none.\\n\\nHowever, the other player has 14 red chips — they are rich in red. If I propose a trade where they agree to cover my moves on red tiles for up to 5 moves, I can use this path. Since I need exactly 5 red moves along this path, and the other player has them, this is viable.\\n\\nBut crucially: I must only cooperate if it gives me a strict benefit. Let’s assess:\\n- If I move directly toward my goal via the red-heavy path, I’ll need 5 red chips covered by the other player.\\n- In return, I don’t need to pay anything yet — the other player will pay for my red moves.\\n- However, if I do not negotiate, I cannot move at all (since I have no red chips), and staying put means I never get to start moving.\\n\\nSo, by proposing a trade, I unlock motion. The key is whether the contract terms with the other player (currently 0 points exchanged on completion) make cooperation worthwhile. Since there’s no penalty and no incentive to help them finish early (they’re selfish too), I only care about my own score.\\n\\nBest move: Move to (0, 1) — this tile is **blue**, and I have 14 blue chips.

But that requires coordination — and I can start building leverage now by making a move.\\n\\nMy initial move: moving to (0, 1) costs 1 blue chip. I have 14, so I can afford it. This puts me on a tile adjacent to red tiles (1,1) and (0,2), which are both red — future targets for potential red coverage.\\n\\nWhy move to (0, 1)? Because:\\n- It’s within my chip budget (blue: B cost = 1)\\n- It’s close to red tiles (starting to position myself near red paths we could take together)\\n- It opens negotiation room: I can now say, \\\"I’m at (0,1), and can move into your red-rich territory if you cover my red costs\\\"\\n- More importantly: if I stay at (0,0), I gain nothing and delay progress.

The problem is red: I need 5 red chips to take this path, but I have none.\n\nHowever, the other player has 14 red chips — they are rich in red. If I propose a trade where they agree to cover my moves on red tiles for up to 5 moves, I can use this path. Since I need exactly 5 red moves along this path, and the other player has them, this is viable.\n\nBut crucially: I must only cooperate if it gives me a strict benefit. Let’s assess:\n- If I move directly toward my goal via the red-heavy path, I’ll need 5 red chips covered by the other player.\n- In return, I don’t need to pay anything yet — the other player will pay for my red moves.\n- However, if I do not negotiate, I cannot move at all (since I have no red chips), and staying put means I never get to start moving.\n\nSo, by proposing a trade, I unlock motion. The key is whether the contract terms with the other player (currently 0 points exchanged on completion) make cooperation worthwhile. Since there’s no penalty and no incentive to help them finish early (they’re selfish too), I only care about my own score.\n\nBest move: Move to (0, 1) — this tile is **blue**, and I have 14 blue chips. I can afford this move easily. Then, from (0, 1), I can consider proposing a deal: 'Cover my next 5 red moves (on red tiles) for 5 moves, and I’ll let you know if I accept.' But that requires coordination — and I can start building leverage now by making a move.\n\nMy initial move: moving to (0, 1) costs 1 blue chip. I have 14, so I can afford it. This puts me on a tile adjacent to red tiles (1,1) and (0,2), which are both red — future targets for potential red coverage.\n\nWhy move to (0, 1)? Because:\n- It’s within my chip budget (blue: B cost = 1)\n- It’s close to red tiles (starting to position myself near red paths we could take together)\n- It opens negotiation room: I can now say, \"I’m at (0,1), and can move into your red-rich territory if you cover my red costs\"\n- More importantly: if I stay at (0,0), I gain nothing and delay progress. Moving to (0,1) is safe and allows for immediate negotiation.\n\nSo I want to move to (0,1).",

If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.
