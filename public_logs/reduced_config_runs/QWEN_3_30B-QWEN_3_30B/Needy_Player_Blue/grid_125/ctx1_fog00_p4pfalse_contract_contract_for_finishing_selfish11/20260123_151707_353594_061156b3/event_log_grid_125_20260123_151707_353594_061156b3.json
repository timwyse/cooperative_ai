Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I lack) is not viable due to red tile requirements. However, I can evaluate paths based on available chips.\\n\\nThe path [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] requires 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green chips — but I have 0 red chips, so I cannot complete this path without trading. Since I don’t have red chips, I cannot move into any red tile unless I acquire them via trade.\\n\\nThe alternative path [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] is shorter (only 4 steps) and only requires 3 red and 1 green. But I start at (0,0), not (2,0). To reach that path, I must go through (1,0) first. (1,0) is a red tile — which costs 1 red chip to enter. Since I have no red chips, I cannot legally move there unless I first obtain red chips.\\n\\nHowever, looking at the other player: they are at (1,0), with 13 red chips and only 2 green and 0 blue. They have abundant red chips. They also have a contract obligation: if *I* reach my goal, they must pay me 15 points. Conversely, if *they* reach theirs, I must pay them 5 points. \\n\\nThus, I have incentive to help them finish early if it benefits me — but only if I gain more from it than from finishing myself. However, since I cannot move toward the goal unless I get red chips, and the only source is the other player, I need to propose a trade.\\n\\nImportant: I should consider whether I can reach the goal at all. If I stay put and never move, I get 0 points. So some move is necessary.\\n\\nBut I can't make any move that requires a red chip until I get red chips. Thus, I must either:\\n- Stay and propose a trade for red chips\\n- Or try to find a different path\\n\\nWait — what about moving to (0,1)? (0,1) is red → costs 1 red chip → same problem.\\n(0,1) = R → need red chip → I have none → can’t move.\\n(1,0) = R → same issue.\\n\\nSo every adjacent cell from (0,0) is either red or blue? Let's confirm:\\n- (0,0) = G → I have 2 green chips\\n- (0,1) = R → red → need 1 red chip → I have 0 → can't move\\n- (1,0) = R → red → same problem\\n→ So **I cannot move anywhere right now** because all adjacent tiles are red, and I have zero red chips.\\n\\nTherefore, I must remain in place and attempt to negotiate a trade for red chips.\\n\\nBest trade: Request red chips from the other player (who has 13), offer blue (I have 14) since they have 0 blue. They might accept a blue-for-red trade.\\n\\nBut I already tried offering 2 blue for 2 red — they rejected. Now I should re-propose, perhaps with better terms or justification.\\n\\nAlso, note: if I eventually reach goal, I get 20 + 5 × remaining chips. I’d want to minimize chip loss. The short path requires 3 red + 1 green = 4 chips. If I trade for 3 red and 1 green, I can take that path and finish with many blue chips (since I start with 14 blue, and don’t use them).\\n\\nIf I give 3 blue and 1 green for 3 red and 1 green, that’s 4 chips lost, but then I can use only 3 red and 1 green to finish. Net savings: I keep 14 - 3 = 11 blue, plus 1 green after giving away 1 — wait, I give up 1 green too?\\n\\nLet’s suppose I trade: give 3 blue, get 3 red. Then I have: B:11, G:2, R:3. Then take path (0,0)→(1,0)→(1"

                  "error": "Failed to get valid JSON response after 3 attempts. Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The other player is at (3, 2) and has {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}. \\n\\nThe shortest path to my goal that uses tiles I have chips for is: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). This path requires: R:2, B:3, G:1. However, I lack any red chips, so I cannot complete this path without trading. \\n\\nBut here's a key observation: the other player is at (3, 2), adjacent to my goal (3, 3). The tile (3, 3) is green ('G'), and they already have 2 green chips. If they move from (3, 2) → (3, 3), they can complete the game immediately by paying 1 green chip (which they have). That would trigger the contract: I receive 15 points from them when they reach their goal. \\n\\nNow consider what happens if I move toward my goal: (0,0) → (1,0) is red ('R'), but I have no red chips. Moving there costs 1 red chip — I don’t have any — so I cannot make this move. Similarly, moving to (0,1) is blue ('B') — I have 14 blue chips, so that’s possible — but then the next tile might still be problematic. However, let's assess the full implications.\\n\\nBut here’s a better idea: Instead of trying to proceed on a path requiring red chips I don’t have, why not **wait** and see if the other player finishes first? If they go from (3, 2) → (3, 3), they complete the game and owe me 15 points. That means I gain 15 points *just because they reach their goal*, regardless of my own progress. \\n\\nEven if I don’t reach my goal, I get 0 points. But if I stay put, and they finish, I get 15 points now — which is valuable. Moreover, reaching (3, 3) myself would give me 20 + 5 * remaining chips. But the only way I can get even close to that is by moving through red-heavy tiles (path needs R:2), which I don’t have.\\n\\nTherefore, if I try to move forward now, I must trade red chips (which I don’t have). Without trade, I’m stuck — I can’t move onto (1,0) or (0,1)? Wait — (0,1) is Blue ('B'), and I have 14 blue chips. So actually, I *could* move to (0,1) with no problem.\\n\\nSo let’s re-evaluate: can I make a safe move?\\n\\nOption: Move to (0,1): tile = B → cost = 1 B chip → I have 14 → possible. Then at (0,1), we go to (0,2)? (0,2) = B → still affordable. (0,3) = B → same. Then (1,3) = B. All B tiles. But (1,3) → (2,3) = R → I have no red. So I’d get stuck again at (2,3) unless I trade.\\n\\nAlternatively, could I use a different path? Let’s look at the second available path: the one that prioritizes using the other player’s chips? It says: [(3,2), (3,3)] with requirement G:1. That’s just one step — going from (3,2) to (3,3), which is green. So if I were at (3,2), I could reach goal in one move if I had one green chip. But I don’t have any green chips — I have 2, but I need to pay when I move to (3,3). But I don’t even have access to (3,2).\\n\\nWait: I am not at (3,2). The other player is at (3,2).\\n\\nBut—importantly—the contract says: if the other player reaches goal, I receive 15 points. Therefore, it is *in my interest* to encourage or allow them to reach (3,3) as soon as possible.\\n"
