Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 1), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 13, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}, meaning I lack red chips entirely, which limits my movement options since many tiles are red. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red is not available due to red tile constraints. However, a viable alternative path is [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], requiring 2 B chips, 2 R chips, and 1 G chip. I currently have no R chips, so I cannot complete this path without assistance. Another feasible path is [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] — but this path requires 3 R chips and 1 G chip. Since I have no R chips, I cannot take this path unless the other player covers the cost of red moves for me.\\n\\nThe other player has 12 red chips and only 0 blue and 2 green — they are rich in red, poor in blue. They are at (1, 0) and likely trying to reach (3, 3) as well. If I propose a trade where they cover my R moves, I can use their red chips to progress, while they could benefit by using my blue chips (which I have 13 of). But I should only agree if it leads to a strictly higher score for me.\\n\\nHowever, on Turn 1, I can make a move immediately: from (0, 1) → (1, 1) is possible because (1,1) is red, and although I don’t have red chips, if I can negotiate with the other player later, or if I’m already promised coverage, it might work. But currently, I have no promises from them — they rejected my previous offer. So I must assess: can I move now?\\n\\nI cannot afford to move to a red tile (like (1,1)) right now since I have no red chips and no one covering me yet. Moving to (0, 0)? (0,0) is green — I have 2 green chips; that would cost 1 green chip. But (0,0) is adjacent. However, going to (0,0) gives me no path forward toward goal — it’s a dead end in terms of progress. From (0,1), moving to (0,0) costs 1 green chip, leaving me with 1 green, but then I’d need to move back, wasting a chip and gaining no advantage.\\n\\nAlternatively, (0,1) → (1,1) is the only meaningful forward step. (1,1) is red — I have zero red chips. I cannot pay the cost unless someone covers it. Since no agreement exists yet, I cannot make this move — not legally.\\n\\nBut consider: what if I propose a deal where I ask them to cover up to 5 red moves? That might allow me to take the shorter path. However, this is Turn 1 — I should act quickly before the other player gains an advantage.\\n\\nBest strategy: Propose a trade *now* to get coverage for future red moves, knowing that once I start moving toward goal, I may benefit more than if I waited. If I delay, the other player may take shortcuts using their own red chips. But importantly: I only cooperate if it **strictly benefits me**.\\n\\nLet me calculate: if I take the short path [(0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)], total cost is 3 red + 1 green. I have 2 green chips — okay for green. But 3 red required. I have none. If I can get them to cover 3 red moves for me, then I can move. Meanwhile, to get coverage, I must promise to cover something in return.\\n\\nThey have 12 red, 2 green, 0 blue. My only surplus is blue (13). So if I propose to cover 3 blue chips for them, in exchange for them covering 3 red chips for me, then they gain access to blue (they have 0), and I gain access to red (I have 0). They might accept because they’re also trying to reach the goal.\\n\\nBut do I benefit? Let's simulate:\\n- If I survive the game and finish, I get 20"
