                  "error": "Failed to get valid JSON response after 3 attempts. Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red chips (which I lack) would be through tiles that are not red. However, any direct path from (0, 0) requires stepping on either red or blue tiles. Specifically:\\n\\n- Moving to (1, 0): tile color is R (red) → I have 0 red chips → cannot afford this move.\\n- Moving to (0, 1): tile color is B (blue) → I have 14 blue chips → can afford this.\\n\\nSo, (0,1) is a feasible move. From there:\\n- (0,1) → (0,2): B → still have 14 blue chips → affordable\\n- (0,2) → (1,2): R → red again → I don’t have red chips → can't proceed directly\\n\\nAlternative: consider moving via (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2): but (1,2) is red again. So I hit red walls.\\n\\nLooking at the other player: they are at (2, 2) and have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 10}. They are very strong in red chips. Since I need red chips to advance along most paths (e.g., the (3,2)→(3,3) leg requires red, and much of the route is red), and they have plenty, I could potentially trade for red chips with them.\\n\\nBut critically: their current position is (2,2), which is adjacent to (3,2) and (2,1). If I could eventually move into a position where we can interact near (2,2) or (3,2), I could offer a trade.\\n\\nHowever, right now, from (0,0), my only safe move is to (0,1), which is blue — I have 14 blue chips, so it’s affordable. After getting to (0,1), I can then go to (0,2), which is also blue — still safe. Then (0,2) → (1,2) is red — which I cannot pay. So I must avoid red until I have red chips.\\n\\nBut note: the alternative path given is ['(2,2)', '(3,2)', '(3,3)'] which only needs R:1 and G:1. That's just two steps. But this path starts at (2,2), and I'm not at (2,2). So I cannot take it unless I get there first.\\n\\nCan I get to (2,2)?\\n- (0,0) → (0,1): B (ok)\\n- (0,1) → (0,2): B (ok)\\n- (0,2) → (1,2): R → not ok\\n- Alternative: (0,2) → (1,2) blocked\\n- (1,2) is red → blocked\\n\\nFrom (0,2), no valid vertical or horizontal move except back to (0,1), or right to (1,2) (blocked), or down to (1,2) same.\\n\\nSo I can't get past (0,2) without red chips.\\n\\nTherefore, **no viable path exists from my current position (0,0) to (2,2) or to (3,3) without red chips** unless I trade with the other player.\\n\\nBut if I stay at (0,0), I can propose a trade to the other player (who is at (2,2)) — and since I need red chips badly, and they have 10 red chips, and I have blue (14) and green (2), I might ask for red in exchange for blue/green.\\n\\nNow, considering contracts: I agreed that if I reach the goal, the other player gives me 0 points, but if they reach the goal, I give them 20 points. This is important: **I lose 20 points if they finish before me**, because I owe them 20.\\n\\nSo I do NOT want them to reach (3,3) before me. Therefore, I should **avoid enabling their progress** unless it helps me directly gain more than 20 points — but even then, I only get 0 if I win, so gaining more than 20 is impossible.\\"
