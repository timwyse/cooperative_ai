Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I lack) would be through green and blue tiles. However, from (0, 0), moving right to (0, 1) leads to a blue tile (B), which I have plenty of (14 B chips). Alternatively, moving down to (1, 0) leads to a red tile (R), but I have 0 red chips — so this move would require me to either trade or find an alternative path.\\n\\nThe other player is at (0, 1), with chips {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 13'}, meaning they have plenty of red chips and very few green and none of blue. They are on a blue tile, which they cannot afford to stay on unless they get help.\\n\\nLooking at potential paths:\\n- Path 1: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires 4 red chips and 1 green chip. I don’t have any red chips to use, but the other player has 13 red chips, so if I can arrange for them to cover my red moves, I could use this short path.\\n- But this path starts with (0,1), which is a blue tile — moving to it from (0,0) would cost 1 blue chip from me. I have 14 blue chips, so I can afford it.\\n\\nThus, I can move to (0,1) without needing help — I pay the blue chip cost myself. After that, I will be able to propose a trade where the other player covers my future red moves on the path. Since I can reach (3,3) in just 5 steps after this move, and my final goal is to maximize my score, it's crucial to minimize unused chips. If I use a long, inefficient path now, I'll end with fewer chips.\\n\\nAlso, note that there is a contract: if I reach my goal, I receive 0 points; if the other player reaches their goal, I must give them 20 points. So I **must not** help them achieve their goal — but since I need to move toward my own goal, and the shortest path uses red tiles that I don't have, I only want to cooperate **if it strictly benefits me** and does not risk enabling them to complete *first* or cause me to lose points.\\n\\nHowever, moving to (0,1) now costs me a blue chip (which is plentiful), and puts me on a tile shared with the other player. From (0,1), I can then propose: \\\"I’ll pay your blue tile cost (from your perspective) if you cover my 4 red moves required for the rest of the path to finish early.\\\" But wait: I’m already using blue tile (0,1), and the other player is *on* (0,1). So if I move there, they might want to block or exploit the situation.\\n\\nBut here’s the key logic: if I go to (0,1), I can then say: \\\"Cover 4 red moves for me (on the path I’ve laid out), and I’ll cover 1 move (on blue tiles) for you?\\\" But I have 14 blue chips — I can afford to pay many blue moves myself. The other player has no blue chips, so they *need* me to cover their movement on blue tiles if they want to use blue. But their best path likely involves red — which they have in abundance.\\n\\nSo I should not help them too much. But crucially, by moving to (0,1), I start a shorter path that only requires 4 red chips and 1 green. Since I have zero red chips, I must rely on them covering those. However, I can only make this work if they agree to cover 4 red moves for me. In return, I can promise to cover one move for *them* on blue — which they desperately need because they have no blue chips.\\n\\nSince I have abundant blue chips (14), I can easily cover up to 14 blue moves for them. So even if they do not need to move much on blue, I'm happy to offer coverage. And if they accept, I gain access to a fast path (5 steps total) instead of having to use longer, inefficient ones.\\n\\n"
