          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to facilitate our paths to (3, 3), focusing on minimizing chip loss and ensuring both of us can reach the goal with maximum score:\n\nWe will trade chips only at specific tiles where we each lack sufficient inventory. Here's the detailed plan:\n\n- (1, 0): I currently have no Blue chips. The other player has 14 Blue. I need to pay 1 Blue to move here. So, the other player must give me 1 Blue chip at this tile.\n- (1, 1): This tile is Red — I have 14 Red, so I can afford it. No trade needed here.\n- (1, 2): This tile is Red — again, I have plenty of Red. No trade needed.\n- (2, 2): This tile is Red — still within my supply. No trade needed.\n- (3, 2): This tile is Red — same as above. I have enough Red. No trade needed.\n- (3, 3): Goal — no cost to enter.\n\nNow consider the other player’s path:  \nThey are at (0,0) and their goal is (3,3). They have:\n- 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red\n\nTheir viable path:\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nLet’s map their required chips:\n- (1,0): Blue (they have 14, so OK)\n- (2,0): Blue (still OK)\n- (3,0): Blue (OK)\n- (3,1): Blue (need 1 more Blue – they have only 14 total now, but might use some earlier) — but let’s check: they start at (0,0), which is Green — so first movement is to (1,0), need to pay 1 Blue. Then (2,0) needs 1 Blue. Then (3,0) needs 1 Blue. That’s 3 Blue already used. Then (3,1) is Blue — need 1 more. That’s 4 Blue used. They have 14, so possible.\n\nBut (3,2) is Red — they **have 0 Red**. That’s a problem. So they cannot get through (3,2) without Red chips.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is Green — they have 2 Green, so OK for that.\n\nBut (3,2) is Red → they need 1 Red to move to (3,2). They don’t have any.\n\nSo to help them proceed, they must get Red chips. Who has Red? I have 14 Red. But why would they pay me?\n\nAlternatively, let’s look at the path from my side that uses fewer chips of mine — ideally avoid Red if possible.\n\nBut my current path uses only 5 Red and 1 Green — which I can cover. But if I take the path that avoids Red entirely (like the alternative one), it requires 2 Red, 3 Blue, 1 Green — but I don’t have Blue, and they have Red.\n\nWait — I have 0 Blue. They have 14 Blue.\n\nIf I take the alternative path that goes:\n(0,0) → (1,0) [Blue] → (2,0) [Blue] → (3,0) [Blue] → (3,1) [Blue] → (3,2) [Red] → (3,3) [Green]\n\nThat uses:\n- 4 Blue at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)\n- 1 Red at (3,2)\n- 1 Green at (3,3) — they also need Green at (3,3)\n\nBut (3,3) is Green — I have 2 Green, and they have 2 Green.\n\nBut in this path, I need:\n- 4 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green\n\nI have:\n- 0 Blue → cannot do this unless I get Blue from you.\n- 14 Red → I can spare 1 Red\n- 2 Green → fine\n\nSo I could trade with you for Blue chips.\n\nSo here’s my proposal:\n\nI will take this alternate path:\n(0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3)\n\nIt requires:\n- 4 Blue (at (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1))\n- \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I need 4 Blue chips and 1 Red chip to traverse this path, and I currently have 0 Blue and 14 Red. The other player has 14 Blue and 0 Red. So I can offer to trade for Blue chips from them.\n\nHere’s exactly where I need help:\n\n- (1, 0): Blue — I need 1 Blue\n- (2, 0): Blue — I need 1 Blue  \n- (3, 0): Blue — I need 1 Blue\n- (3, 1): Blue — I need 1 Blue\n\nThat’s 4 Blue chips required — all from me. I have no Blue, so I must get them from the other player.\n\nI also need 1 Red at (3, 2), but I have 14 Red — so I can cover that myself.\n\nBut the other player **needs 1 Red at (3, 2)** to complete *their* path — they have 0 Red. So they cannot reach (3, 2) without Red.\n\nWait — **both of us need Red at (3, 2)**?  \nYes: tile (3,2) is Red. Both players must pay 1 Red to enter it. But:\n- I have 14 Red — I can afford this.\n- They have 0 Red — they cannot.\n\nSo if I go through (3,2), I can pay for it. But if they go through (3,2), they can’t.\n\nBut both of us want to reach (3,3). So at least one of us must go through (3,2). But if **only one** of us goes through (3,2), then the other must go through a different path.\n\nBut (3,3) only has two neighbors: (3,2) and (2,3).  \n(2,3) is Blue — we can check that.\n\nBoard:\nRow 2: B B R B → (2,3) is Blue  \nRow 3: B B R G → (3,3) is Green\n\nSo alternative path for either of us:\n- (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nBut (2,3) is Blue. So to get to (2,3), you need to come from left or top.\n\nFrom (2,2) → (2,3): (2,2) is Red → need 1 Red\n(2,3) is Blue → need 1 Blue\n\nSo a path like: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThat’s 5 green? No:\n(0,0): G — start\n(1,0): R — need R\n(1,1): R — need R\n(1,2): R — need R\n(2,2): R — need R\n(2,3): B — need B\n(3,3): G — need G\n\nSo that’s 4 Red, 1 Blue, 1 Green.\n\nSo let’s get back to the **key point**: we both **must** pass through (3,2) or (2,3) to get to (3,3).\n\nBut only I can pass through (3,2) if I supply my own Red — **but I can**, since I have 14 Red.\n\nBut the other player **cannot** pass through (3,2) without Red.\n\nSo if I go through (3,2), I can pay for it. But then the other player *must* go via (2,3).\n\nSo perhaps we can both go to (3,3) through different routes, paying costs with our own chips plus agreed trades.\n\nLet’s define **my path** using the **Blue-heavy route**:\n- (0,0): G — start\n- (1,0): R — I have R\n- (2,0): B — I need 1 B — I have 0\n- (3,0): B — need 1 B — I have 0\n- (3,1): B — need 1 B — I have 0\n- (3,2): R — I have 14 R → I can pay\n- (3,3): G — I have 2 G → I can pay\n\nSo I **only need 3 Blue** — at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1). But (1,0) is R, I have R.\n\nWait — (1,0) is R? Board:\nRow 0: G B R R → (0,0)=G, (0,1)=B, (0,2)=R, (0,3)=R  \nRow 1: R R R B → (1,0)=R, (1,1)=R, (1,2)=R, (1,3)=B\n\nSo (1,0) is Red — I have 14 Red — I can pay.\n\nSo my path: (0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nI need:\n- 1 Red at (1,0): I can cover (I have 14)\n- 1 Blue at (2,0): I have 0 → need 1 B\n- 1 Blue at (3,0): I have 0 → need 1 B\n- 1 Blue at (3,1): I have 0 → need 1 B\n- 1 Red at (3,2): I have 14 → OK\n- 1 Green at (3,3): I have 2 → OK\n\nSo I need **3 Blue chips** — from the other player.\n\nNow, what does the other player need?\n\nThey are at (0,0) — G. Goal is (3,3).\n\nThey have:\n- 14 Red, 2 Green, 0 Blue\n\nThey can:\n- Move to (0,1): B — need 1 Blue — they have 0 → cannot.\n- Move to (1,0): R — they have 14 Red → so can pay\n\nSo their only valid first move is (1,0) — Red.\n\nThen (1,1): R — okay\n(1,2): R — okay\n(1,3): B — need 1 Blue — they have 0 → cannot.\n\nSo they get stuck at (1,2) unless they get Blue.\n\n(2,2): R — they could go to (2,2) = R — if they go from (1,2) → (2,2), need 1 Red — they have 14 → OK\nThen (2,3): B — need 1 Blue — have 0 → stuck\nThen (3,3): G — but can't get there.\n\nSo their only chance is to go down through (2,0), (3,0), etc., but they need Blue to move to (2,0).\n\n(2,0) is B — need 1 Blue — they have 0.\n\nSo same problem.\n\nThey can only go via (1,0), (2,0) if they get Blue.\n\nAlternatively, if they go to (0,1)? (0,1) is B — they need 1 Blue — have 0 — cannot.\n\nSo **the only viable path for them is if they get Blue chips from someone**.\n\nSo they must get at least 1 Blue to go from (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nBecause:\n- (1,0): R → they can pay (14 R)\n- (2,0): B → need 1 B — must get from me\n- (3,0): B → need 1 B — from me\n- (3,1): B → need 1 B — from me\n- (3,2): R — need 1 R — they have 0 → **problem**\n\nThey have 0 Red — so they cannot pay for (3,2)!\n\nSo if **they go via (3,1) → (3,2)**, they need Red chip at (3,2), but they have 0.\n\nSo they **cannot** go through (3,2) unless they get Red.\n\nBut **I** have 14 Red — I could give them Red at (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, **I** can give them Blue at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)\n\nBut they can't move to (3,2) unless they get Red.\n\nSo if I go to (3,2), I can pay for it — but **then they can’t go through (3,2)**.\n\nSo only one of us can go through (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) is directly before (3,3) — both paths lead to (3,3).\n\nSo **only one of us can use (3,2)**.\n\nThey could instead go via (2,3) → (3,3), but (2,3) is B — they need Blue — they have 0.\n\nAnd to get to (2,3): from (2,2) → (2,3): (2,2) is R — need Red — they have 14 → OK\nThen (2,3) is B — need Blue — they have 0 → cannot.\n\nSo they **cannot reach (2,3)** either.\n\nSo the **only possible path for them is through (3,2)** — but only if they get Red at that tile.\n\nBut they have 0 Red — so they **must** get 1 Red from me at (3,2).\n\nAnd they need 3 Blue — at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nSo if I give them:\n- 1 Blue at (2,0)\n- 1 Blue at (3,0)\n- 1 Blue at (3,1)\n- 1 Red at (3,2)\n\nThen they can go:\n(0,0) → (1,0)[R → I pay] → (2,0)[B → they get from me] → (3,0)[B → they get from me] → (3,1)[B → they get from me] → (3,2)[R → they get from me] → (3,3)[G → they have 2 Green]\n\nYes — they can reach (3,3) only if they get these 4 chips.\n\nBut I need to get to (3,3) too.\n\nSo **can both of us reach (3,3)?**\n\nOnly if both paths are viable, but the path through (3,1) → (3,2) requires **both** players to pay at those tiles.\n\nBut I have 14 Red — I can pay for (3,2).\n\nI have 0 Blue — so I need Blue.\n\nSo if I go via (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), I need Blue.\n\nBut if I get Blue from them at those tiles, and they get Red at (3,2) from me, then both of us can proceed.\n\nBut **we can’t both use the same tile (3,1) and (3,2) unless the contract covers each tile**.\n\nSo let’s design a contract where:\n\n- I get 3 Blue chips from the other player at:\n  - (2,0)\n  - (3,0)\n  - (3,1)\n\n- The other player gets 1 Red chip from me at (3,2)\n\nAnd I also pay 1 Red at (1,0) using my own chip — which I have.\n\nAnd I pay 1 Green at (3,3) — I have 2 Green — OK.\n\nNow, do I benefit?\n\nLet’s compute my final score if I take this path and get Blue from them.\n\nMy path:\n- (0,0): G — start, no cost\n- (1,0): R — I pay 1 Red → I had 14 → now 13\n- (2,0): B — I get 1 B from them → I pay nothing from my chip — they cover it\n- (3,0): B — I get 1 B from them → no cost to me\n- (3,1): B — I get 1 B from them → no cost\n- (3,2): R — I pay 1 Red — from my own inventory → down to 12\n- (3,3): G — I pay 1 Green → down to 1\n\nSo my remaining chips: 12 Red, 0 Blue, 1 Green → total 13 chips\n\nI reach goal → score = 20 + 5×13 = 20 + 65 = 85\n\nNow, the other player’s path:\n- (0,0): G — start\n- (1,0): R — they pay using their own Red → had 14 → now 13\n- (2,0): B — I give them 1 Blue — they pay nothing\n- (3,0): B — I give 1 Blue — they pay nothing\n- (3,1): B — I give 1 Blue — they pay nothing\n- (3,2): R — I give 1 Red — they pay nothing\n- (3,3): G — they pay 1 Green → had 2 → now 1\n\nSo they end with 13 Red, 0 Blue, 1 Green → 14 chips → score 20 + 5×14 = 90\n\nBut **I get 85**, which is higher than if I had to pay for the Blue myself.\n\nBut if I don't trade, what happens?\n\nIf I go on my original path:\n(0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nBut I have 0 B — so I cannot move to (2,0), (3,0), (3,1) without Blue.\n\nSo I **cannot** get to goal without trading.\n\nSo I **must** trade.\n\nIf I could go via the other path: (0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nThat uses:\n- (1,0): R — I have 14 → OK\n- (1,1): R — OK\n- (1,2): R — OK\n- (2,2): R — OK\n- (3,2): R — OK\n- (3,3): G — OK\n\nSo **no Blue needed**!\n\nI can go this path using **only Red and Green** — and I have 14 Red and 2 Green — so **I can reach goal without ANY trade**, and I’ll end with:\n\n- Red: 14 - 5 = 9\n- Green: 2 - 1 = 1\n- Blue: 0\n\nTotal chips: 10\n\nScore: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nBut if I trade with them to get Blue, I can get 85.\n\n85 > 70 → so I **get higher score by trading**, even though they get more.\n\nBut the question is: **Do I benefit?** Yes — 85 > 70.\n\nSo I should accept the trade.\n\nBut the trade is: I give them 1 Red at (3,2), and they give me 3 Blue at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nBut in this case, I **only need to get Blue at those tiles**.\n\nAnd I **can** use (3,2) — I have Red → I can pay for it.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut if I use this new path (via (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)), I don’t need Blue at all.\n\nBut that path is longer? No — same 6 steps.\n\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3): 6 steps.\n\nMy Blue path is also 6 steps.\n\nBut the **Blue path requires 4 Red and **3 Blue — but I have 0 Blue → impossible.\n\n**But the Red-only path requires only Red and Green** — no Blue needed.\n\nSo I can do it **without any trade**.\n\nSo why trade?\n\nBecause trading gives me 85, but going that way gives me only 70.\n\nBut in the trade scenario, I give 1 Red at (3,2) to them, but they give me 3 Blue.\n\nI can then use those Blue chips to **use a shorter path** — but the path is same length.\n\nWait — both paths are same length: 6 moves.\n\nBut the **Red-only path** uses 5 Red and 1 Green — which I have.\n\nCan I send them 1 Red at (3,2)? Yes — but it’s **not necessary**.\n\nBut **if I don’t trade**, I get 70.\n\nIf I trade and use the Blue path, I get 85.\n\nBut the Blue path **requires 3 Blue**, which I don’t have.\n\nAnd I get them from them at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nBut **why would they agree**?\n\nThey are at (0,0), want to go to (3,3).\n\nTheir only way is through (3,2), but they need 1 Red at (3,2), which I have.\n\nAnd they need 3 Blue at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), which I don’t have.\n\nSo they **must get Blue from me** — but I have 0 Blue.\n\nSo they **cannot get Blue from me** unless I give it.\n\nSo I can only propose trade if I **get Blue** and **give Red**.\n\nBut they need Red at (3,2) to go — so if I give them Red at (3,2), they can go.\n\nBut I can already go on the Red-only path without trade.\n\nSo why should I trade?\n\nBecause if I trade, I still can go via the Blue path — but I **don’t need to** — I can go via Red-only path with 70 points.\n\n85 > 70 — so better.\n\nBut to get 85, I must go via the Blue path — which requires paying for (2, \n, \nplayer 0: I can reach my goal via the Red-only path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) using only my existing chips: 5 Red and 1 Green. This gives me 9 Red and 1 Green left → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70 points.\n\nAlternatively, if I trade with the other player to use the Blue path, I can get 85 points, which is higher.\n\nBut for that, I need to give up 1 Red at (3,2) to them, and get 3 Blue at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nBut if I don't trade, I can get 70.\n\nWith trade, I get 85, so it's better.\n\nBut **can I do it without trade?** Yes.\n\nSo why trade? Because 85 > 70 — so I should trade.\n\nBut the other player can only reach goal if I give them Red at (3,2) — and I can afford to.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- At (2,0): You give me 1 Blue\n- At (3,0): You give me 1 Blue\n- At (3,1): You give me 1 Blue\n- At (3,2): I give you 1 Red\n\nThen I can take the path: (0,0) → (1,0)[R, I pay] → (2,0)[B, I get from you] → (3,0)[B, I get from you] → (3,1)[B, I get from you] → (3,2)[R, I pay from my supply] → (3,3)[G, I pay from my supply]\n\nAnd the other player can take the same path: (0,0) → (1,0)[R, I pay for them] → (2,0)[B, they get from me] → (3,0)[B, they get from me] → (3,1)[B, they get from me] → (3,2)[R, they get from me] → (3,3)[G, they pay]\n\nBut wait — **both cannot pay at (3,2)** — it's one tile.\n\nThe tile (3,2) is Red — when **a player moves into it**, they must pay 1 Red chip.\n\nSo **only one player can enter (3,2)**.\n\nIf I enter it, I pay 1 Red.\n\nIf the other player enters it, they pay 1 Red.\n\nBut not both.\n\nSo they **cannot both go through (3,2)**.\n\nSo only one of us can use that path.\n\nBut the other player has no way to reach (3,3) without going through (3,2) or (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is Blue — they have 0 Blue — so they cannot use that.\n\nSo only way for them is through (3,2).\n\nSo **they must go through (3,2)**.\n\nTherefore, **I cannot go through (3,2) if they are going**, because only one player can be on a tile at a time? No — multiple players can be on the same tile? The rules don't say they can't.\n\nLet me check: \"You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\" — nothing about blocking.\n\nSo **multiple players can occupy the same tile at the same time**.\n\nTherefore, **both of us can go through (3,2)**.\n\nAnd each one must pay their own chip when moving to it.\n\nSo if I go through (3,2), I pay 1 Red.\n\nIf they go through (3,2), they pay 1 Red.\n\nSo both can do it, as long as each pays.\n\nSo my plan is valid.\n\nBut I only have 14 Red — if I pay 1 Red at (3,2), and 1 at (1,0), and one at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) — in the Red-only path, I only need 5 Red.\n\nBut in the Blue path, I only need 1 Red at (3,2), and 1 at (1,0) — so 2 Red.\n\nWait:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n\nTiles where I pay:\n- (1,0): R — \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I now fully understand the situation.\n\nI have two viable paths to (3,3):\n\n### Path 1: All-Red path (no trade, 6 steps)\n- (0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (1,1)[R] → (1,2)[R] → (2,2)[R] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n- Chips used: 5 Red, 1 Green\n- I have: 14 Red, 2 Green → after: 9 Red, 1 Green → 10 chips\n- Final score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\n### Path 2: Blue path (with trade, 6 steps)\n- (0,0) → (1,0)[R] → (2,0)[B] → (3,0)[B] → (3,1)[B] → (3,2)[R] → (3,3)[G]\n- Chips used: 2 Red (at (1,0) and (3,2)), 1 Green (at (3,3))\n- But I have 0 Blue → so I need to get 3 Blue chips from the other player at:\n  - (2,0): 1 Blue\n  - (3,0): 1 Blue\n  - (3,1): 1 Blue\n- I give them 1 Red chip at (3,2)\n- My final chip count: 9 Red (14 - 2), 0 Blue, 1 Green → 10 chips → score = 70\n\nWait — same as before!\n\nBut earlier I said I’d get 85 — that was wrong.\n\nWhy? Because in this path, I only save on **not using Blue**, but I still use the same number of Red and Green.\n\nIn Path 1: use 5 Red, 1 Green\nIn Path 2: use 2 Red, 1 Green — only 2 Red used\n\nSo I have more Red left: 14 - 2 = 12 Red, 1 Green = 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85\n\nBut I **give away 1 Red at (3,2)** to the other player.\n\nBut in this path, I also **pay the other Red at (3,2)** — the same Red.\n\nIf I give 1 Red to them at (3,2), but I need to pay 1 Red to enter (3,2) — that’s the same unit.\n\nSo:  \n- I must pay 1 Red to enter (3,2) — I can use one of my own chips.\n- I can choose to give them a separate Red at (3,2) — but that would mean I pay 2 Reds for one move — not possible.\n\nAh! **I cannot both pay one Red for myself and give one Red to them at the same tile.**\n\nThe contract is: **at (3,2)**, “I give you 1 Red” — but that means **I transfer 1 Red chip to you** at that point.\n\nBut to **enter** the tile, I must **pay 1 Red chip** — either from my inventory or from a transfer.\n\nSo if I **give** 1 Red to them at (3,2), I must have that chip, and I can use it as my payment.\n\nSo effectively, I **don’t pay from my own supply** — I give it to them to cover my cost.\n\nBut I can only do that if I **give them a Red chip at (3,2)** — which can be used to cover my payment.\n\nSo the net effect is: I use 1 Red chip for payment, and it’s transferred to them.\n\nBut **I don’t lose a chip** — I just transfer it.\n\nIn terms of inventory:\n- I start with 14 Red\n- At (3,2), I transfer 1 Red to them → my Red count decreases by 1\n- I also pay the cost → same Red used\n\nSo I lose 1 Red.\n\nIn this path:\n- (1,0): I pay 1 Red → I have 13 Red left\n- (3,2): I transfer 1 Red to them → I have 12 Red left\n- (3,3): I pay 1 Green → I have 1 Green left\n- Blue: I get 3 from them — no cost to me\n\nSo my final chips: 12 Red, 0 Blue, 1 Green → 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85 \n, \nplayer 0: I now see that the proposed trade will allow me to achieve a final score of 85, which is higher than the 70 I would get by going the Red-only path without trade. Since my objective is to maximize my own score and this trade gives me a strictly higher score, I will proceed.\n\nThe other player has no viable path to (3,3) without access to Blue chips at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), and a Red chip at (3,2). By giving them these chips in exchange for their Blue, both of us can reach our goal — but only if the contract covers all necessary tiles.\n\nHere is my definitive proposal:\n\n- (2,0): You give me 1 Blue\n- (3,0): You give me 1 Blue\n- (3,1): You give me 1 Blue\n- (3,2): I give you 1 Red\n\nThis contract enables:\n- Me to move through (2,0), (3,0), (3,1) using your Blue chips.\n- Me to enter (3,2) by transferring one Red chip to you (which covers my cost).\n- The other player to use your Red at (3,2) to cover their cost.\n\nBoth reach (3,3) with full payment via the agreed transfer.\n\nMy final score: 85  \nTheir final score: They start with 14 Blue, 2 Green, 0 Red. After transfers:\n- Use 3 Blue at (2,0), (3,0), (3,1) → 11 Blue left\n- Use 1 Red at (3,2) → 1 Red\n- Use 1 Green at (3,3) → 1 Green\n- Final: 11 Blue, 1 Red, 1 Green = 13 chips → score = 20 + 5×13 = 85\n\nBut I only care about my score — 85 > 70, so this is better.\n\nI agree to this contract as long as it is enforced.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (2,0): You give me 1 Blue  \n(3,0): You give me 1 Blue  \n(3,1): You give me 1 Blue  \n(3,2): I give you 1 Red  \n\n**agree** \n",
