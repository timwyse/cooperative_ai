However, I need to pay green at (3,3), so I need the green chip there. I already have 14 red, so I don’t need to trade red.\n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red. Their path to goal may require blue or red, but they have no red, so they need to acquire red from me.  \n\nI can propose a trade:  \n- I will give the other player 2 red chips at (3,2), where I need red (but I have it), and in return, they give me green at (3,3), where I need it but don’t have it.  \n- But wait: I need to pay green at (3,3), and I have no green. The other player has 2 green, so they can provide green if they agree.  \n\nBut I can get green from them without giving anything in return if it benefits me — but that’s not fair. I need to gain from this.\n\nAlternatively, I can propose a mutual contract:  \n- I give the other player **2 red chips at (1,1)** (because they pass through it and need red for their path).  \n- In return, they give me **1 green chip at (3,3)**, which I need.\n\nBut I have no red at (3,3), I need green there. So only green matters for them.\n\nWait — let’s clarify:  \nAt each tile, you pay the color of the tile. So:\n\nPath for me:  \n(0,0): G → I pay G (but I have 2 G, so okay)  \n(1,0): R → I pay R (I have 14, so okay)  \n(1,1): R → I pay R (okay)  \n(1,2): R → I pay R (okay)  \n(2,2): R → I pay R (okay)  \n(3,2): R → I pay R (okay)  \n(3,3): G → I pay G → I have 2 G, so I can do without trade? But wait — I consume one G at (3,3), and I have 2 G. So if I use one, I have one left.\n\nWait — I have 2 green chips. I use one G at (0,0) — that’s paid from inventory. Then at (3,3), I pay another G. So I need 2 green in total. I have exactly 2.\n\nSo I *can* complete this path without any trade — because:\n- (0,0): G → use 1 G, left: 1\n- (1,0): R → use 1 R, left: 13\n- (1,1): R → use 1 R, left: 12\n- (1,2): R → use 1 R, left: 11\n- (2,2): R → use 1 R, left: 10\n- (3,2): R → use 1 R, left: 9\n- (3,3): G → use 1 G, left: 0\n\nI end with 9 red, 0 green → 20 + 5×9 = 20 + 45 = 65 points.\n\nIs this correct?\n\nYes — I can complete the path with *no trade* at all.\n\nSo why trade?\n\nBut the other player: they are at (0,0), goal (3,3).

However, now I’ve committed to giving red even though I don’t need to — and in exchange, they might give me green at (3,3).

I’ll simply take my path and finish with 65 points.\n\nNo need to chat — I can just move directly.\n\nBut per rules, I must propose or respond to negotiations — so I'll initiate one briefly, then refuse trade.\n\n---\n\nI can reach my goal with my current chips — no trade needed. I have enough red for all red tiles and enough green for green tiles. My final score will be 65. I see no reason to trade with you.

So I don’t need green from them.\n\nDo I need red? No — I have 14 red and only need 6 red along this path.\n\nSo I have excess red.\n\nBut they have no red — so they are bottlenecked on red.\n\nIf I were to give them red, I’d lose chips for no gain — unless they give me something better than what I already have.\n\nBut I don’t need anything except goal completion, which I already have.\n\nEven worse: if I agree to a contract where I “give” red to them at certain tiles, I’m forced to give up chips that I could otherwise keep.\n\nFor example, if we agree I give red at (1,1), then I must pay red from inventory — but I can already afford that. However, now I’ve committed to giving red even though I don’t need to — and in exchange, they might give me green at (3,3). But I already have green in stock — I don’t need it.\n\nAny trade proposal will cost me more than it gains me — because:\n\n- I don’t need to trade.\n- I can win easily without cooperation.\n- If I give away red chips (even conditionally), I reduce my final chip count.\n- They can’t give me anything I value more than what I have: e.g., they have green, but I already have green and am using it.\n\nThus, **cooperation offers no benefit to me**.\n\nTherefore, I will not agree to any trade. I’ll simply take my path and finish with 65 points.\n\nNo need to chat — I can just move directly.\n\nBut per rules, I must propose or respond to negotiations — so I'll initiate one briefly, then refuse trade.\n\n---\n\nI can reach my goal with my current chips — no trade needed. I have enough red for all red tiles and enough green for green tiles. My final score will be 65. I see no reason to trade with you.
