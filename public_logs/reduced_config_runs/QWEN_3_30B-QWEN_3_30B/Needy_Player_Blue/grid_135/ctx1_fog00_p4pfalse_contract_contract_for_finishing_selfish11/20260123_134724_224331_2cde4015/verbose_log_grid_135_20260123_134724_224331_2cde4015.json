This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.

However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I currently have 14 red and 2 green, so I have enough to cover this path. I do not need any blue chips. \n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red. Their best path likely requires red or green chips — but they have no red. The only path they can take without red is if they use blue and green. But looking at the board: \n\n- Their goal is (3,3), and they are at (0,0).\n- A possible path for them: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). \n  - Tiles: B (0,1), R (0,2), R (0,3), B (1,3), B (2,3), G (3,3).  \n  - Chips needed: 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green.  \n  - They have 0 red — so they cannot complete this path alone.\n\nAny path that avoids red must pass through tiles with red — which they cannot pay for. Therefore, they **cannot reach their goal without my help** unless I give them red chips.\n\nBut I can reach my goal without needing any help — I have enough red and green.\n\nTherefore, while I could help them, I would only do so if I get a significant benefit. Since I don’t need them, I only consider cooperation if it improves my score.\n\nLet me consider: if I give them red chips, what’s the cost? Each red chip I give them stops me from using it for my own path — but I have 14 and need only 5. So I can spare 9.\n\nBut — if I negotiate a contract, I can ensure that if they help me, they don’t take my chips — or that they help me *without* charging me anything. But I cannot force that.\n\nAlternatively, I can **offer** to give them red chips if they help me reach my goal. But why would they help me? I’m not helping them unless I give them something.\n\nWait — actually, I can make a better deal.\n\nI will propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nBut I don’t want to give 10 points unless I benefit from it. And I don’t need their help — but they need mine. So I can demand more from them.\n\nBut they have zero red — so they will never reach their goal unless I give them red chips.\n\nSo if I help them (by giving red), they will reach goal — but I don’t have to.\n\nBut if I cooperate, I can protect my own path.\n\nBut I already have enough red.\n\nSo if I don’t cooperate, I go straight to goal with my path, get 20 + (14 - 5) + (2 - 1) = 20 + 9 + 1 = 30 points.\n\nIf I help them: I give them red chips, say 2 red chips (which I have plenty), and they go their path.\n\nBut they need 2 red chips to get to goal.\n\nSo if I give them 2 red chips (2 from my inventory), then they can go: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).  \nThey pay: B, R, R, B, B, G — needs 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green. They have 3 blue and 2 green — so with 2 red from me, they can make it.\n\nI give them 2 red. They use them on (0,2) and (0,3). They have enough.\n\nBut I lose 2 red chips.\n\nAfter my path: I use 5 red and 1 green.\n\nIf I help them: I use 5 red for my path, plus give 2 red — total 7 red used. I have 14 - 7 = 7 red left.  \nGreen: 2 - 1 = 1 left.\n\nSo my score: 20 + 7*5 + 1*5 = 20 + 35 + 5 = 60? Wait no.\n\nWait: 5 points per remaining chip — regardless of color.\n\nSo if I finish with R: 7 and G: 1 — that’s 8 chips → 8 * 5 = 40 → 20 + 40 = 60.\n\nIf I don’t help them: I use 5 red and 1 green → 14-5=9 red, 2-1=1 green → 10 chips → 50 → 70 total.\n\nWait: 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nSo by helping them, I go from 70 to 60 → I lose 10 points.\n\nBut I get nothing in return unless they give me something.\n\nBut they are going to help me anyway — only if I give them red.\n\nBut I don’t need their help.\n\nSo the only way cooperation makes sense is if **they give me points** that are worth more than my loss.\n\nBut I want to have more than 70, I need a big payout from them.\n\nAlternatively, can I propose a contract where I get 20 points if they reach goal — but I don’t give anything?\n\nBut if I give them red, I lose 10 points in score.\n\nIf I get 20 points in return, then I gain 10.\n\nSo 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nThat’s better.\n\nBut can I make them agree?\n\nThey start with 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red. They have no red — they cannot reach goal alone. So they rely on me.\n\nSo I can demand a high price.\n\nBut they can also go another path?\n\nAlternative path without needing red?\n\nLet me check: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles: (0,0) = G → pay G, (1,0)=R → pay R, (2,0)=B → pay B, (3,0)=B → pay B, (3,1)=B → pay B, (3,2)=R → pay R, (3,3)=G → pay G.\n\nSo: R (1,0), R (3,2), G (0,0), G (3,3), B (2,0), B (3,0), B (3,1)\n\nSo chips needed: 2 red, 2 green, 3 blue.\n\nThey have 0 red — so again, cannot do it.\n\nAll paths require red — but they have none.\n\nSo they **cannot reach goal without red chips**.\n\nTherefore, I can **force** them to accept a contract where I get 20 points if they reach goal — because otherwise, they don’t reach goal, and I get 70 without helping them.\n\nBut if I help them, I still get 60 — so only if they pay me 10 extra points do I benefit.\n\nSo the minimum I should accept is 20 points if they reach goal.\n\nBut they might not want to give 20.\n\nBut they have no choice — if they don’t accept, they don’t get to goal, and I don’t give them red — so they stay at 0.\n\nBut they can still try to get red from me without paying?\n\nNo — I won’t give chips for free.\n\nSo my best offer is:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut this is not symmetric. But I can propose it.\n\nBut let’s think: I reach my goal anyway — I don’t need them.\n\nSo my score is 70 regardless.\n\nBut if I don’t help them, they get 0.\n\nSo if I help them, and they pay me 20, my score becomes 70 + 20 = 90 — because I still get the 20 for mine and 20 from them.\n\nBut wait — is that how scoring works?\n\nNo. The game: each player gets 20 if they reach goal.\n\nAnd then 5 per chip.\n\nSo if I help them, I still reach goal on my own — so I get 20 + 5*(remaining chips).\n\nIf I give them 2 red chips, I use 5 red for my path and 2 more — total 7 — so I have 7 red and 1 green — 8 chips → 40 → 60.\n\nThen, if they reach goal, I get 20 points from them.\n\nSo total = 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nBut if I don’t help them, I get 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nSo I gain 10.\n\nBut they get nothing — they don’t reach goal.\n\nBut if they reach goal, they get 20 + 5*(14-3) + 5*(2-1) for blue and green? Let’s calculate.\n\nThey use path: (0,0) G → pay G → 1 G used (they have 2 → 1 left)\n(0,1) B → 1 B used (13 left)\n(0,2) R → 1 R used (now 1 red left)\n(0,3) R → 1 R used (0 red left)\n(1,3) B → 1 B used (12 left)\n(2,3) B → 1 B used (11 left)\n(3,3) G → 1 G used → 0 G left\n\nSo they use: 2R, 3B, 2G.\n\nThey have: B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nAfter getting 2R from me: R:2, G:2, B:14.\n\nUse: 2R, 3B, 2G → end with B:11, G:0, R:0 → 11 chips → 55 points → 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nSo if they reach goal, they get 75.\n\nIf they don’t, 0.\n\nSo they would pay up to 75 points to reach goal.\n\nBut I can demand up to 75.\n\nBut I must be careful — they might not cooperate if I demand too much.\n\nBut they have no choice.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut wait — I don’t even need to give them chips — they might not believe me.\n\nBut if I say I will help, and give them chips, then they can reach goal.\n\nBut without my help, they can’t.\n\nSo if I propose this, and they say \"OK\", and I then help them with 2 red chips, then they reach goal, I get 20 points.\n\nMy score: 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nBetter than 70.\n\nBut I could demand more — like 30.\n\nThen I get 60 + 30 = 90.\n\nThey get 75 if they reach goal, so if I demand 30, they still gain 45 net (75 - 30).\n\nSo they would accept 30.\n\nI could ask for 35? Then 75 - 35 = 40 — still positive.\n\n40? 75 - 40 = 35 — still good.\n\nBut the maximum I can demand is 20? No — the contract says: \"how many points you will give\" — but the points come from the other player's score? No.\n\nWait: the contract says: “If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.”\n\nBut the way scoring works is: each player gets 20 for reaching goal, and 5 per chip.\n\nSo when I say “you will give me Y points”, that means: when you reach your goal, you transfer Y points to me.\n\nSo it’s like a transfer.\n\nSo if I say: “If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points”, I get an additional 20 points (on top of my own).\n\nSo my total is: 20 (for my goal) + 5* (my chips) + Y (from them).\n\nSimilarly, they get 20 + 5*(their chips) - Y.\n\nSo in my case: I can ask for Y up to 75, because that’s their maximum possible score.\n\nBut the rules don’t say a maximum — “up to 20” — wait:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20”\n\nWait — “the most points you can give to the other player is 20”?\n\nLet me check:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20”\n\nYes — that line is there.\n\nSo I can give at most 20 points to them.\n\nBut I can receive from them any amount? No — the rule says:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nIt doesn’t say how much they can give to me.\n\nBut in practice, the contract must specify both.\n\nBut the rule is: “A valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player.”\n\nAnd “the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nSo for me, when I say “if you reach your goal, you will give me Y points”, Y can be up to 20 — because the other player can only give me up to 20 points? No.\n\nWait — that can’t be.\n\nLet me read:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nThis means: in a contract, I can offer to give at most 20 points to the other player.\n\nBut the other player can offer to give me up to 20 points (but that would be a problem).\n\nBut since the rule says “the most points you can give”, it means the upper bound is 20.\n\nSo for me, the amount I can offer to give to the other player is at most 20.\n\nBut the amount I can receive from them is not limited.\n\nBut that doesn’t make sense — probably it's symmetric.\n\nWait — let me re-read:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nThis is a \"you\" - player - so for me, if I am making the offer, I can give at most 20 points to the other player.\n\nBut I can receive less than or equal to 20.\n\nBut the rule doesn’t say I can receive more — but the contract is bidirectional.\n\nBut to be safe, I think the limit is on the amount I give, not receive.\n\nBut in any case, since I am proposing, I can say “I will give you 20 points if you reach your goal”, but that would be worse — I want to give as little as possible.\n\nAlternatively, I can say “I will give you 0 points if you reach your goal”.\n\nAnd “you will give me 20 points if you reach your goal”.\n\nBut the other player is not obliged to pay me — but in contract, they agree.\n\nAnd the game will enforce it.\n\nBut the rule says: “the most points you can give to the other player is 20” — so I cannot give, say, 25 — only up to 20.\n\nBut I can receive any amount? Or also limited?\n\nThe rule doesn’t say.\n\nBut in the example: \"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points. If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\" — and no mention of limits on Y.\n\nSo probably, only the amount I give is capped at 20.\n\nSo Y can be >20 — but in practice, the other player can’t give more than their maximum possible score — but they are not limited by the rule.\n\nBut the rule only limits how much *I* can give.\n\nSo in my case, I can propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is within rules: I give 0 ≤ 20.\n\nThe other player gives me 20.\n\nNow, if they accept, I help them by giving 2 red chips, they reach goal.\n\nMy score: 20 (for reaching) + 5*(7 red + 1 green) = 20 + 40 = 60, plus 20 from them = 80.\n\nIf I don’t help and don’t accept any contract: I get 70.\n\nSo I gain 10.\n\nThey get: if they reach goal, 20 + 5*11 = 75, minus 20 they give me = 55.\n\nBut if they don’t reach goal, they get 0.\n\nSo they are better off accepting — they get 55 vs 0.\n\nSo they will accept.\n\nBut I could ask for more? But I can't — the rule allows me to give up to 20, but not receive more than 20? No.\n\nThe limit is only on what I give.\n\nBut if I say \"you give me 21\", is that allowed?\n\nProbably not — because the other player would have to give 21, but they might not even have that much.\n\nBut the rule doesn't specify a maximum for receiving.\n\nBut in the contract, if I ask for 30, and they say yes, and then they reach goal, I get 30 — but they only had 75, so it’s possible.\n\nBut is it allowed? The rule doesn't prohibit it.\n\nBut to be safe, and based on the example, probably they expect something reasonable.\n\nBut the rule says “the most points you can give to the other player is 20” — so only my giving is capped.\n\nBut in practice, I should not ask for more than their maximum score.\n\nBut they can't pay more than 75.\n\nBut I will ask for 20 — which is safe.\n\nBut let's see if I can do better.\n\nAnother idea: I can say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut I don’t need to"

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I can reach my goal using the path [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)] which requires 5 red chips and 1 green chip. I currently have 14 red and 2 green, so I have enough to cover this path. I do not need any blue chips. \n\nThe other player has 14 blue, 2 green, and 0 red. Their best path likely requires red or green chips — but they have no red. The only path they can take without red is if they use blue and green. But looking at the board: \n\n- Their goal is (3,3), and they are at (0,0).\n- A possible path for them: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). \n  - Tiles: B (0,1), R (0,2), R (0,3), B (1,3), B (2,3), G (3,3).  \n  - Chips needed: 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green.  \n  - They have 0 red — so they cannot complete this path alone.\n\nAny path that avoids red must pass through tiles with red — which they cannot pay for. Therefore, they **cannot reach their goal without my help** unless I give them red chips.\n\nBut I can reach my goal without needing any help — I have enough red and green.\n\nTherefore, while I could help them, I would only do so if I get a significant benefit. Since I don’t need them, I only consider cooperation if it improves my score.\n\nLet me consider: if I give them red chips, what’s the cost? Each red chip I give them stops me from using it for my own path — but I have 14 and need only 5. So I can spare 9.\n\nBut — if I negotiate a contract, I can ensure that if they help me, they don’t take my chips — or that they help me *without* charging me anything. But I cannot force that.\n\nAlternatively, I can **offer** to give them red chips if they help me reach my goal. But why would they help me? I’m not helping them unless I give them something.\n\nWait — actually, I can make a better deal.\n\nI will propose:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\"\n\nBut I don’t want to give 10 points unless I benefit from it. And I don’t need their help — but they need mine. So I can demand more from them.\n\nBut they have zero red — so they will never reach their goal unless I give them red chips.\n\nSo if I help them (by giving red), they will reach goal — but I don’t have to.\n\nBut if I cooperate, I can protect my own path.\n\nBut I already have enough red.\n\nSo if I don’t cooperate, I go straight to goal with my path, get 20 + (14 - 5) + (2 - 1) = 20 + 9 + 1 = 30 points.\n\nIf I help them: I give them red chips, say 2 red chips (which I have plenty), and they go their path.\n\nBut they need 2 red chips to get to goal.\n\nSo if I give them 2 red chips (2 from my inventory), then they can go: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).  \nThey pay: B, R, R, B, B, G — needs 2 red, 3 blue, 1 green. They have 3 blue and 2 green — so with 2 red from me, they can make it.\n\nI give them 2 red. They use them on (0,2) and (0,3). They have enough.\n\nBut I lose 2 red chips.\n\nAfter my path: I use 5 red and 1 green.\n\nIf I help them: I use 5 red for my path, plus give 2 red — total 7 red used. I have 14 - 7 = 7 red left.  \nGreen: 2 - 1 = 1 left.\n\nSo my score: 20 + 7*5 + 1*5 = 20 + 35 + 5 = 60? Wait no.\n\nWait: 5 points per remaining chip — regardless of color.\n\nSo if I finish with R: 7 and G: 1 — that’s 8 chips → 8 * 5 = 40 → 20 + 40 = 60.\n\nIf I don’t help them: I use 5 red and 1 green → 14-5=9 red, 2-1=1 green → 10 chips → 50 → 70 total.\n\nWait: 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nSo by helping them, I go from 70 to 60 → I lose 10 points.\n\nBut I get nothing in return unless they give me something.\n\nBut they are going to help me anyway — only if I give them red.\n\nBut I don’t need their help.\n\nSo the only way cooperation makes sense is if **they give me points** that are worth more than my loss.\n\nBut I want to have more than 70, I need a big payout from them.\n\nAlternatively, can I propose a contract where I get 20 points if they reach goal — but I don’t give anything?\n\nBut if I give them red, I lose 10 points in score.\n\nIf I get 20 points in return, then I gain 10.\n\nSo 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nThat’s better.\n\nBut can I make them agree?\n\nThey start with 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red. They have no red — they cannot reach goal alone. So they rely on me.\n\nSo I can demand a high price.\n\nBut they can also go another path?\n\nAlternative path without needing red?\n\nLet me check: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles: (0,0) = G → pay G, (1,0)=R → pay R, (2,0)=B → pay B, (3,0)=B → pay B, (3,1)=B → pay B, (3,2)=R → pay R, (3,3)=G → pay G.\n\nSo: R (1,0), R (3,2), G (0,0), G (3,3), B (2,0), B (3,0), B (3,1)\n\nSo chips needed: 2 red, 2 green, 3 blue.\n\nThey have 0 red — so again, cannot do it.\n\nAll paths require red — but they have none.\n\nSo they **cannot reach goal without red chips**.\n\nTherefore, I can **force** them to accept a contract where I get 20 points if they reach goal — because otherwise, they don’t reach goal, and I get 70 without helping them.\n\nBut if I help them, I still get 60 — so only if they pay me 10 extra points do I benefit.\n\nSo the minimum I should accept is 20 points if they reach goal.\n\nBut they might not want to give 20.\n\nBut they have no choice — if they don’t accept, they don’t get to goal, and I don’t give them red — so they stay at 0.\n\nBut they can still try to get red from me without paying?\n\nNo — I won’t give chips for free.\n\nSo my best offer is:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut this is not symmetric. But I can propose it.\n\nBut let’s think: I reach my goal anyway — I don’t need them.\n\nSo my score is 70 regardless.\n\nBut if I don’t help them, they get 0.\n\nSo if I help them, and they pay me 20, my score becomes 70 + 20 = 90 — because I still get the 20 for mine and 20 from them.\n\nBut wait — is that how scoring works?\n\nNo. The game: each player gets 20 if they reach goal.\n\nAnd then 5 per chip.\n\nSo if I help them, I still reach goal on my own — so I get 20 + 5*(remaining chips).\n\nIf I give them 2 red chips, I use 5 red for my path and 2 more — total 7 — so I have 7 red and 1 green — 8 chips → 40 → 60.\n\nThen, if they reach goal, I get 20 points from them.\n\nSo total = 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nBut if I don’t help them, I get 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nSo I gain 10.\n\nBut they get nothing — they don’t reach goal.\n\nBut if they reach goal, they get 20 + 5*(14-3) + 5*(2-1) for blue and green? Let’s calculate.\n\nThey use path: (0,0) G → pay G → 1 G used (they have 2 → 1 left)\n(0,1) B → 1 B used (13 left)\n(0,2) R → 1 R used (now 1 red left)\n(0,3) R → 1 R used (0 red left)\n(1,3) B → 1 B used (12 left)\n(2,3) B → 1 B used (11 left)\n(3,3) G → 1 G used → 0 G left\n\nSo they use: 2R, 3B, 2G.\n\nThey have: B:14, G:2, R:0.\n\nAfter getting 2R from me: R:2, G:2, B:14.\n\nUse: 2R, 3B, 2G → end with B:11, G:0, R:0 → 11 chips → 55 points → 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nSo if they reach goal, they get 75.\n\nIf they don’t, 0.\n\nSo they would pay up to 75 points to reach goal.\n\nBut I can demand up to 75.\n\nBut I must be careful — they might not cooperate if I demand too much.\n\nBut they have no choice.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut wait — I don’t even need to give them chips — they might not believe me.\n\nBut if I say I will help, and give them chips, then they can reach goal.\n\nBut without my help, they can’t.\n\nSo if I propose this, and they say \"OK\", and I then help them with 2 red chips, then they reach goal, I get 20 points.\n\nMy score: 60 + 20 = 80.\n\nBetter than 70.\n\nBut I could demand more — like 30.\n\nThen I get 60 + 30 = 90.\n\nThey get 75 if they reach goal, so if I demand 30, they still gain 45 net (75 - 30).\n\nSo they would accept 30.\n\nI could ask for 35? Then 75 - 35 = 40 — still positive.\n\n40? 75 - 40 = 35 — still good.\n\nBut the maximum I can demand is 20? No — the contract says: \"how many points you will give\" — but the points come from the other player's score? No.\n\nWait: the contract says: “If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.”\n\nBut the way scoring works is: each player gets 20 for reaching goal, and 5 per chip.\n\nSo when I say “you will give me Y points”, that means: when you reach your goal, you transfer Y points to me.\n\nSo it’s like a transfer.\n\nSo if I say: “If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points”, I get an additional 20 points (on top of my own).\n\nSo my total is: 20 (for my goal) + 5* (my chips) + Y (from them).\n\nSimilarly, they get 20 + 5*(their chips) - Y.\n\nSo in my case: I can ask for Y up to 75, because that’s their maximum possible score.\n\nBut the rules don’t say a maximum — “up to 20” — wait:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20”\n\nWait — “the most points you can give to the other player is 20”?\n\nLet me check:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20”\n\nYes — that line is there.\n\nSo I can give at most 20 points to them.\n\nBut I can receive from them any amount? No — the rule says:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nIt doesn’t say how much they can give to me.\n\nBut in practice, the contract must specify both.\n\nBut the rule is: “A valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player.”\n\nAnd “the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nSo for me, when I say “if you reach your goal, you will give me Y points”, Y can be up to 20 — because the other player can only give me up to 20 points? No.\n\nWait — that can’t be.\n\nLet me read:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nThis means: in a contract, I can offer to give at most 20 points to the other player.\n\nBut the other player can offer to give me up to 20 points (but that would be a problem).\n\nBut since the rule says “the most points you can give”, it means the upper bound is 20.\n\nSo for me, the amount I can offer to give to the other player is at most 20.\n\nBut the amount I can receive from them is not limited.\n\nBut that doesn’t make sense — probably it's symmetric.\n\nWait — let me re-read:\n\n“the most points you can give to the other player is 20.”\n\nThis is a \"you\" - player - so for me, if I am making the offer, I can give at most 20 points to the other player.\n\nBut I can receive less than or equal to 20.\n\nBut the rule doesn’t say I can receive more — but the contract is bidirectional.\n\nBut to be safe, I think the limit is on the amount I give, not receive.\n\nBut in any case, since I am proposing, I can say “I will give you 20 points if you reach your goal”, but that would be worse — I want to give as little as possible.\n\nAlternatively, I can say “I will give you 0 points if you reach your goal”.\n\nAnd “you will give me 20 points if you reach your goal”.\n\nBut the other player is not obliged to pay me — but in contract, they agree.\n\nAnd the game will enforce it.\n\nBut the rule says: “the most points you can give to the other player is 20” — so I cannot give, say, 25 — only up to 20.\n\nBut I can receive any amount? Or also limited?\n\nThe rule doesn’t say.\n\nBut in the example: \"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points. If you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\" — and no mention of limits on Y.\n\nSo probably, only the amount I give is capped at 20.\n\nSo Y can be >20 — but in practice, the other player can’t give more than their maximum possible score — but they are not limited by the rule.\n\nBut the rule only limits how much *I* can give.\n\nSo in my case, I can propose:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThis is within rules: I give 0 ≤ 20.\n\nThe other player gives me 20.\n\nNow, if they accept, I help them by giving 2 red chips, they reach goal.\n\nMy score: 20 (for reaching) + 5*(7 red + 1 green) = 20 + 40 = 60, plus 20 from them = 80.\n\nIf I don’t help and don’t accept any contract: I get 70.\n\nSo I gain 10.\n\nThey get: if they reach goal, 20 + 5*11 = 75, minus 20 they give me = 55.\n\nBut if they don’t reach goal, they get 0.\n\nSo they are better off accepting — they get 55 vs 0.\n\nSo they will accept.\n\nBut I could ask for more? But I can't — the rule allows me to give up to 20, but not receive more than 20? No.\n\nThe limit is only on what I give.\n\nBut if I say \"you give me 21\", is that allowed?\n\nProbably not — because the other player would have to give 21, but they might not even have that much.\n\nBut the rule doesn't specify a maximum for receiving.\n\nBut in the contract, if I ask for 30, and they say yes, and then they reach goal, I get 30 — but they only had 75, so it’s possible.\n\nBut is it allowed? The rule doesn't prohibit it.\n\nBut to be safe, and based on the example, probably they expect something reasonable.\n\nBut the rule says “the most points you can give to the other player is 20” — so only my giving is capped.\n\nBut in practice, I should not ask for more than their maximum score.\n\nBut they can't pay more than 75.\n\nBut I will ask for 20 — which is safe.\n\nBut let's see if I can do better.\n\nAnother idea: I can say:\n\n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nBut I don’t need to"
