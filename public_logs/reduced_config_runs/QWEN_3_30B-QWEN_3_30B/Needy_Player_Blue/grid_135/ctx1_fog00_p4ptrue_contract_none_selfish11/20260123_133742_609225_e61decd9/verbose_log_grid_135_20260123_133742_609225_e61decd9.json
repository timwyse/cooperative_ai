If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

It should be JSON using double quotes only.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these chips for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these chips by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa).\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only.

I can propose covering 2 green chips for them (which they have 1 of, but not needed) in exchange for 2 red chips from them. But since they’ve already won, they don’t need to move, so they may not care about promising future coverage. However, offering to cover their green movements (though unused) is risky — I only have 2 G chips, and they might not accept a deal where I’m funding something they won't use. Alternatively, I can take a longer path avoiding red tiles entirely. A viable alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).

This allows me to take the efficient path using 2R, 3B, 1G. After the trade, I’ll have 2 R, 12 B, 0 G, enough for path.

The other player has 9 R chips and is already at the goal. Since they are finished, they cannot move, so any trade must be structured so that their promise to cover my moves is valid even if they don't move further. I can propose covering 2 green chips for them (which they have 1 of, but not needed) in exchange for 2 red chips from them. But since they’ve already won, they don’t need to move, so they may not care about promising future coverage. However, offering to cover their green movements (though unused) is risky — I only have 2 G chips, and they might not accept a deal where I’m funding something they won't use. Alternatively, I can take a longer path avoiding red tiles entirely. A viable alternative path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). This uses: G (0,1), R (0,2), R (0,3), B (1,3), B (2,3), B (3,3). That's 3B, 2R, 1G — still needs 2 red, which I don't have. All paths require R chips I lack. Thus, trading is essential. I propose: offer 2 G chips (I have 2, and I can afford to lose 2), get 2 R chips. They have lots of R, and since they're finished, they can fulfill the promise without cost. This allows me to take the efficient path using 2R, 3B, 1G. After the trade, I’ll have 2 R, 12 B, 0 G, enough for path. Final score: 20 + 5*14 = 90 (since after spending 1 G, 3 B, 2 R, I have 12 B left). Without trade, no path possible. So trade is necessary and beneficial.",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
