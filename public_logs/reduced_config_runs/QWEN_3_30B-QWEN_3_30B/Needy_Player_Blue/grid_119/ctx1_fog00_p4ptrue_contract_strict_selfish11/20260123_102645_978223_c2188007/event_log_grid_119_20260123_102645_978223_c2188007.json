Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My current chip inventory is {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}. The board layout shows that (0, 0) is green (G), so moving to adjacent tiles will cost chips of their respective colors. I have two viable paths to the goal, both 6 steps long. \\n\\nPath 1: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)] – requires {'R': 5, 'G': 1}. I have 14 red chips, which is more than enough for 5 R moves. I only have 2 green chips, but only one G move is required (on (0,0) → (1,0)? No – wait: check tile colors.\\n\\nActual tile colors:\\n- (1,0): R → red\\n- (1,1): R → red\\n- (1,2): R → red\\n- (2,2): R → red\\n- (2,3): R → red\\n- (3,3): G → green\\nSo all moves except the final one are red, and the last is green. So this path requires 5 red and 1 green. I have 14 R (enough) and 2 G (just enough). So I can complete this path without trade. However, I must consider whether I should trade with the other player to save chips or gain an advantage.\\n\\nBut wait: in this path, I need to move through (1,0) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), each requiring 1 chip of color of the destination tile. So:\\n- (1,0): R → use 1 R\\n- (1,1): R → use 1 R\\n- (1,2): R → use 1 R\\n- (2,2): R → use 1 R\\n- (2,3): R → use 1 R\\n- (3,3): G → use 1 G\\nTotal: 5 R, 1 G — matched by my inventory (14 R, 2 G). I can do this entire path without any trading.\\n\\nBut now consider Path 2: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\\n- (1,0): R → R\\n- (2,0): B → B\\n- (3,0): B → B\\n- (3,1): B → B\\n- (3,2): B → B\\n- (3,3): G → G\\nSo this path requires 1 R, 4 B, 1 G.\\nBut I have 0 B chips. I cannot afford even one B move unless I get help from the other player.\\n\\nNow, recall the contract: I have been promised coverage from the other player for:\\n- (0,1): B (they cover it for me)\\n- (3,2): B (they cover it for me)\\n- (1,0): R (I cover this for them? Wait no).\\nLet's recheck contract:\\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'R', 'status': 'unused'},\\n '(0,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'},\\n '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'B', 'status': 'unused'}}\\n\\nSo: \\n- For (1,0) → someone (me) promises to cover the R cost if they move there. But since I’m starting at (0,0), and if I go to (1,0), it’s a move that I make. But the contract says that *I* am covering the R cost for *the other player* if they step on (1,0). That doesn’t affect me moving onto (1,0)—I still have to pay myself unless I'm covered for it. But I am NOT promised coverage for moving to (1,0); instead, I owe the other player R chips if they ever move to"
