You are in a better position to help me with my goal because I need red and green chips to progress, but you have no red chips (you have 14 blue and 2 green), so you can’t supply red — which is critical for my path. However, you *do* have blue chips, which would help you if I were to take a path requiring blue.\n\nBut here's the key: I can make it to my goal using only green and red chips (which I already have), via this low-risk path:\n- (0,0) → (1,0): pay R (1 red used)\n- (1,0) → (1,1): pay R\n- (1,1) → (1,2): pay R\n- (1,2) → (2,2): pay R\n- (2,2) → (2,3): pay R (5 red total)\n- (2,3) → (3,3): pay G (1 green used)\n\nTotal: 5R + 1G — and I have exactly that: 14R and 2G. So I do **not** need you at all unless you want to trade.\n\nHowever, if you’re going to try to go straight down the leftmost column (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3), you’ll need:\n- (1,0): R → but you have no R! ❌\nSo you cannot take that path without trading.\n\nTherefore, you **must** trade with me to get red chips.\n\nBut I have plenty of red. So if you agree to help me reach my goal, I can offer you red chips in return—but I don’t need anything from you in *chips*, since I can already make it on my own.\n\nWait. But here’s the catch: even though I can make it alone, helping you **only costs me 5R and 1G**, which I have in excess. And if I help you, I get 15 points from your success, which is way more than the 10 I’d give you.\n\nMoreover, **if I don't help you, you can’t reach your goal**—because you need red in your path, and you have zero red chips.\n\nSo you're dependent on me.\n\nHence, the best deal for me is:\nIf I reach my goal, I give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you give me 15 points.\n\nThis way, I get 15 points from your effort (and you can't reach it without me), and I only risk giving up 10 points in return. \n\nAnd even if you don’t accept, I can finish on my own with zero cost to me.\n\nSo this is a very safe proposal — and profitable for me, regardless of whether you agree or not. But if you don’t let me help you, you’ll fail — and so I lose absolutely nothing by offering this.\n\nSo final offer:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 10 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 15 points.\n\n**agree**"

Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n{trading_rules}\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them.",
