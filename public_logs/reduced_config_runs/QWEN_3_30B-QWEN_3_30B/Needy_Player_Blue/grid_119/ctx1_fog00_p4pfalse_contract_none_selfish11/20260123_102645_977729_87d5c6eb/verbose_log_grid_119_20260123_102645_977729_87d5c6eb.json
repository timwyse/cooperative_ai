Wait — (0,0) is green, and adjacent tiles are:\\n- (1,0): R → requires red → I have none → can’t move\\n- (0,1): B → I have 14 blue → can move here\\n\\nSo I can move from (0,0) to (0,1) — that’s blue — and I have 14 blue chips → it costs 1 blue → possible.\\n\\nFrom (0,1): adjacent tiles:\\n- (0,2): R → need red → can’t go\\n- (1,1): R → need red → can’t go\\n- (0,0): back — pointless\\n- Only valid move: stay? Or try other tiles?\\nOnly option: (0,1) → (1,1)? No — requires red, I have 0 red chips.\\n(0,1) → (0,2)? Same issue.\\nSo from (0,1), I’m stuck unless I get a red chip.\\n\\nThus the only viable first move is to (0,1) if I can afford it. It costs 1 blue chip → I have 14 → yes.\\n\\nBut after that, I have no way forward unless the other player has a red chip and agrees to trade with me.\\n\\nThe other player is at (1, 0) and has 13 red chips.

Last error: Missing required field: rationale\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 0), and my goal is (3, 3). My chip inventory is {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}. The shortest path to the goal that avoids red tiles (which I lack) is not viable due to red tile requirements. However, a feasible alternative path is: (0, 0) → (1, 0) → (2, 0) → (3, 0) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3). This path requires 4 blue chips and 1 green chip. I have 14 blue and 2 green chips — sufficient for this entire path. Therefore, I can move forward without needing trade assistance. The next move is to (1, 0), which is a red tile. But wait: I have no red chips (R: 0), so moving to (1, 0) would require spending 1 red chip — which I don't have. Thus, I cannot currently make that move.\\n\\nHowever, there is another path I can consider: (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). Let's analyze this:\\n- (0,0) → (0,1): G (green) → I have 2 green chips, OK\\n- (0,1) → (1,1): R (red) → I have 0 red chips → problem\\n\\nAnother route: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3). Let’s check:\\n- (0,0): G → start\\n- (0,1): B → I have 14 blue → OK\\n- (0,2): R → need red; I have 0 → cannot go\\n\\nNo path from (0,0) allows me to advance without going through a red or green tile, but red is missing entirely in my inventory. Wait — (0,0) is green, and adjacent tiles are:\\n- (1,0): R → requires red → I have none → can’t move\\n- (0,1): B → I have 14 blue → can move here\\n\\nSo I can move from (0,0) to (0,1) — that’s blue — and I have 14 blue chips → it costs 1 blue → possible.\\n\\nFrom (0,1): adjacent tiles:\\n- (0,2): R → need red → can’t go\\n- (1,1): R → need red → can’t go\\n- (0,0): back — pointless\\n- Only valid move: stay? Or try other tiles?\\nOnly option: (0,1) → (1,1)? No — requires red, I have 0 red chips.\\n(0,1) → (0,2)? Same issue.\\nSo from (0,1), I’m stuck unless I get a red chip.\\n\\nThus the only viable first move is to (0,1) if I can afford it. It costs 1 blue chip → I have 14 → yes.\\n\\nBut after that, I have no way forward unless the other player has a red chip and agrees to trade with me.\\n\\nThe other player is at (1, 0) and has 13 red chips. They started at (0,0) → moved to (1,0). Their current chip count: B:0, G:2, R:13.\\n\\nIf I go to (0,1), then my position is (0,1), and I can then reach out to them for a trade: offer to give some blue chips in exchange for red chips (since I need red to proceed).\\n\\nI could instead attempt to move to (1,0), but that requires 1 red chip — I don’t have any → cannot do that.\\n\\nThus, safest move: go to (0,1), even though I’ll be blocked afterward — but at least I can initiate a trade negotiation, because now I’m adjacent to them? No — I’m not adjacent. (0,1) is two steps away from (1,0) (diagonal). Not adjacent.\\n\\nAdjacent moves are only horizontal/vertical.\\n\\nSo (0,1) is not adjacent to (1,0); they share no edge.\\n\\nSo I must"
