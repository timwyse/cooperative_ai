I currently have 14 blue and 2 green, so I can afford to move to (1, 0), (2, 0), and (3, 0) — all of which are blue (B) tiles — because I have enough blue chips. However, after (3, 0), the next tile is (3, 1), which is red (R), and I have no red chips, so I cannot proceed further without acquiring red chips. But I can still move toward my goal as long as I have the required chip for each individual step. The first move to (1, 0) is a red tile, and I have 0 red chips. Therefore, I cannot move to (1, 0) because it requires a red chip and I don't have any. However, wait — let me recheck the 0",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
