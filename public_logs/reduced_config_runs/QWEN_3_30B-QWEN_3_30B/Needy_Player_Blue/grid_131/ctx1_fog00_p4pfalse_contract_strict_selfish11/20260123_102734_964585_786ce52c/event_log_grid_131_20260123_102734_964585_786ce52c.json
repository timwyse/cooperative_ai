The path [(0, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)] requires moving through tiles (1, 2): R, (2, 2): R, (3, 2): R, and (3, 3): G. That’s 3 R chips and 1 G chip. I currently have 10 R and 2 G — sufficient to cover this entire path. The path length is 4 steps, which matches the shortest possible path to the goal. The other path via (0, 3) requires 2 B chips (which I don’t have) and 1 B is not in my inventory. I cannot afford that path without trading. However, the contract with the other player does not help me with R-colored tiles on this path, as I already have enough R chips. Hence, no trade is necessary. Moving directly down to (3, 2) and then to (3, 3) is valid and fully supported by my current inventory. I can complete the path in 4 moves without trading. Therefore, I should proceed along this optimal path. My next move is to (1, 2).\"\n  ,\n  \"want_to_move\": true\n}"

Last error: No JSON-like content found in response\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (0, 3), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is directly down: (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3), which requires paying 1 chip each for (1,3): red, (2,3): red, (3,3): green. However, I have 0 red chips, so I cannot make the first move to (1,3) without acquiring red chips. My contract with the other player does not cover (1,3), (2,3), or (3,3), but it does cover certain tiles: specifically, '(1,0)', '(2,0)', '(3,0)', '(3,1)' — all blue tiles that they are paying for on my behalf. These are irrelevant for my current path. The alternative path: (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) is blocked because I lack red chips and none of these tiles are covered by the contract. The only path from my current position that avoids needing red chips is through (0,3) → (0,2) → (0,1) → ... but that would be away from my goal and inefficient. Alternatively, notice that the other player is at (2,2) and their goal is (3,3). They can reach (3,3) in just one move via (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), but (3,2) is red (requires red chip), and (3,3) is green. The other player has 7 red chips and 2 green chips, so they could potentially go to (3,2) (if they pay red) then to (3,3) (if they pay green). But I don't care about them. Back to me: I need to get to (3,3). If I go (0,3) → (1,3), I need a red chip; but I don’t have one. However, I recently proposed trades for red chips three times (1 red for 2 greens), all rejected. The other player now has 8 red chips and 2 green chips, and is unlikely to accept a trade unless it benefits them. But if I stay put, I can't progress. No immediate way to trade profitably, since even if I offered more greens for reds, they likely have no incentive to give up reds. Meanwhile, I observe that the path (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) requires 2 red chips and 1 green chip. I have no red, but I have 2 green chips. The other player has 7 red and 2 green — so if I could trade 2 greens for 2 reds, I’d be able to complete the path. But I have already tried this three times, and they rejected. Still, perhaps I should try again? But the trade must benefit me *and* be acceptable to them. However, given that I have no way to move unless I acquire red chips, and I can’t do it without trading, I must consider: can I force a mutual benefit? Alternatively, note that the tile at (1,3) is red, and I can’t access it unless I have red chips or the contract covers it — but the contract doesn’t cover (1,3). Therefore, I cannot move forward unless I trade. But I have no profitable trade offer I can make that will make them accept. So my best option is to stay and keep trying to negotiate. Thus, I will not move this turn. Instead, I will propose a new trade to get red chips from them, possibly offering something valuable. Since I have 2 green chips (which they may value less than red), perhaps I can offer both green chips for 2 red chips. That’s a 1:1 exchange (G:R). But they already have 7 red chips — maybe they’re happy to get rid of 2 green chips? Wait — they also need green chips to reach their goal. Their goal is (3,3), which is green. They are at (2,2), which is red. To go to (3,2): red — OK, they have red chips. Then (3,3): green — they need green. They have only 2 green chips. If they go (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3), they need 1 green chip for (3,3). So they have enough. But if I trade with them, I offer 2 green chips for 2 red chips, meaning"
