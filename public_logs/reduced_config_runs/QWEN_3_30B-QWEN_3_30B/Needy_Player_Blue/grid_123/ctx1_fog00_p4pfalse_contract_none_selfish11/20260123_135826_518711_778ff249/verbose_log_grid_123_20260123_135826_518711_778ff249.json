Since I need red chips to proceed, I must trade for them. I previously proposed a 1:1 trade for G for R, but was rejected. Now, I can try a new trade offer: I can offer 1 green chip (of which I have 2) in exchange for 1 red chip. This trade would give me 1 red chip (sufficient to move to (3,2)) while only costing me 1 green chip. After this trade, I will have 1 'R' and 1 'G' left. Then I can move to (3,2), spend 1 'R', then move to (3,3) and spend 1 'G' — finishing with 1 'R' and 0 'G', totaling 1 chip after completion. Alternatively, if I cannot trade now, I could stay put, but that risks being unable to move later. To avoid \"\n  ,\n  \"want_to_move\": false\n}",

This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
