Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let me analyze both paths and chip requirements.\n\nMy current chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}  \nOther player's inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n\nMy best path without trading:  \n[(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]  \nChips needed: {'R': 5, 'G': 1}  \nI have enough R (14) and G (2) → can complete this path without trading.\n\nOther player’s best path without trading:  \n[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]  \nChips needed: {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}  \nThey have B (14), G (2), but R (0) → cannot complete this path alone.\n\nThus, **they need my R chips** to reach their goal, but **I don’t need their chips** to reach mine.\n\nSo, they are desperate to cooperate. I can use that to my advantage.\n\nProposed contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 0 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **20 points**.\n\nWhy this is strictly beneficial for me:\n- I can reach my goal without helping them (my path uses only R and G, which I have).\n- They cannot reach their goal without my help (they have no R chips).\n- So, if they want to reach their goal, they must accept my terms.\n- I get 20 points if they reach their goal (which they must try to do), and I get to keep all my chips.\n- I gain 20 points at no cost to myself.\n\nIf they decline, they fail and get 0 points. I still get 20 (for reaching my goal) and potentially 5×chips remaining (I’ll have 14-5=9 R, 2-1=1 G, so 5×10 = 50 bonus → total 70 points). So I'm already in a good position.\n\nBut by offering them 20 points in return for *them* reaching goal, I get the same outcome (20 points), but it’s only if they reach. However, since I can already reach my goal without them, I only want to force them to help *me* if they can provide something I need — but they don’t.\n\nWait — they don’t have any R, but I need only R and G.\n\nWait — can I trade with them?\n\nThey have: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R.\n\nI have: 14 R, 2 G, 0 B.\n\nIf I want to use their tiles with B, I **could** avoid some R use, but my best path doesn’t require B.\n\nAlternative path for me using their B:  \n[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)] → needs R:1, B:4, G:1  \nI have G:2 — ok.  \nI have R:14 — ok.  \nBut I have no B → need 4 B.\n\nThey have 14 B → I can trade.\n\nBut I don’t *need* to trade. Their B is not essential for me.\n\nBut suppose I trade: can I get R from them? They have 0 R — no.\n\nSo they can’t give me R. They can only give me B.\n\nTrading B for R? They have B, I have R.\n\nBut I don’t need B — I only need R and G.\n\nSo I have all I need.\n\nTherefore:  \n- I can reach my goal without any trade.  \n- They cannot reach theirs without my R, which they don’t have.  \n- So if they want to reach their goal, they *must* get R from me.\n\nSo, I can *demand* that they pay me for R.\n\nBut they have B, which I don’t need.\n\nSo I can’t trade R for B — that would hurt me: I’d give up R for B I don’t want.\n\nBut I could propose: “You can get R from me if you give me 20 points if you reach your goal.”\n\nBut I don’t need to give them anything — because I can reach my"
