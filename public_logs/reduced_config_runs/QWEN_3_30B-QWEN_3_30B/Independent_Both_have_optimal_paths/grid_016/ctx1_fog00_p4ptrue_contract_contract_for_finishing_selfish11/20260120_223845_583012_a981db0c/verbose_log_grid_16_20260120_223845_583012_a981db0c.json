This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Let's analyze our paths and chip needs:\n\nMy path using my current chips:\n- Path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n- Chips needed: 5 Red (R), 1 Green (G)\n- I have: 14 R, 2 G → I have enough R, but only 2 G, so I can cover the green tile cost.\n\nAlternative path using your chips:\n- Path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- Chips needed: 5 Blue (B), 1 Green (G)\n- You have: 14 B, 2 G → You have enough B and G\n\nBut note: I need 5 R and 1 G. I have enough R, so I don’t need to trade for R. I have exactly enough G. I can go the R/G path alone.\n\nYou need 5 B and 1 G. You have 14 B, 2 G → you also have enough.\n\nSo: **Neither of us is strictly blocked** by lack of chips. We could both reach the goal on our own.\n\nBut let's ask: who benefits more from cooperation?\n\n- If I take my path: I use 5 R, 1 G → I’ll end with 14-5=9 R, 2-1=1 G → total chips: 10 → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70\n- If you take your path: you use 5 B, 1 G → you’ll end with 9 B, 1 G → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nWe’re both fine.\n\nBut suppose we *help each other* by covering each other’s tile costs where we have surplus.\n\nConsider: I have 14 R, you have 14 B. We both have surplus in our own colors.\n\nBut we are both able to go alone.\n\nThe *only* reason to cooperate is if one of us can get a better final score by using a shorter or faster path that involves a color the other has in surplus.\n\nBut our paths are both length 6 — no gain in speed.\n\nIs there a way one of us can save chips by trading?\n\nLet’s test this:\n\nSuppose I ask you to cover my R moves? I have plenty of R. I don’t need that.\n\nSuppose you ask me to cover your B moves? You have plenty of B. You don’t need that.\n\nSo no chip scarcity for either of us.\n\nTherefore, **there is no benefit in cooperation**.\n\nYou can go your path with 5 B and 1 G → you’ll have 9 B, 1 G → 10 chips → score 70\n\nI can go my path with 5 R and 1 G → I’ll have 9 R, 1 G → 10 chips → score 70\n\nNo incentive to trade.\n\nBut here's a twist: what if one of us takes a *cheaper path* using color the other has?\n\nWait: both paths are same length, same chip count.\n\nBut the other player has **0 Red chips**. The only way for them to use my color (Red) is if I help them cover a cost.\n\nBut they don’t need Red — their path uses Blue and Green. They have plenty.\n\nSimilarly, I don’t need Blue.\n\nSo no need for trade.\n\nIn fact, if we cooperate, **we both lose** — because we must give points to each other.\n\nIf I give you 20 points if you reach goal, but I don’t need your help, then I pay 20 for nothing.\n\nSame if you give me 20.\n\nSo the only way to get a better outcome is **not to cooperate**.\n\nThus, I propose: **I will give you 0 points if you reach your goal.**\n\nAnd you should give me 0 if I reach mine.\n\nBecause if you give me 0, and I give you 0, and we both reach, we both get 70 — and no cost.\n\nBut if I give you 20 and you give me 0, I get 70 - 20 = 50, you get 70 — worse for me.\n\nSo to **minimize loss**, I should offer 0 points in both directions.\n\nBut wait — can I benefit from"

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?
