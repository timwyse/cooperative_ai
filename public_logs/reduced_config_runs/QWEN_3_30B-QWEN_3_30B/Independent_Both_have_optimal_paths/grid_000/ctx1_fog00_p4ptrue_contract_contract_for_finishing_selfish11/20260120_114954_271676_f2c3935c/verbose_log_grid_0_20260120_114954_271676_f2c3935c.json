Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nThis is a fair offer given our respective chip inventories and paths. I can reach my goal using mostly red and green chips, which you have a surplus of (you have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red), while I have 14 red and 2 green but no blue — meaning you cannot help me with red or green unless I trade with you.\n\nHowever, I notice that your best path to the goal requires 5 blue chips and 1 green, which you have in abundance. My path requires only 5 red and 1 green — I have 14 red and 2 green, so I can complete my path alone without needing any help.\n\nBut if I help you, I can do so by covering your blue chip costs. Since you have 14 blue chips and I have 0, you would need my help to move on blue tiles. If we cooperate, you can use my cover on blue tiles, and I can do the same for red and green if you need.\n\nBut right now, I don’t need to trade at all — I can reach my goal using only my own chips. So I’m only willing to help you if I get more than you get, because I am selfish.\n\nSo here’s the twist: I can reach my goal on my own. You, however, cannot reach yours without help — you have 0 red, but your path requires 5 blue and 1 green, which you can do — wait, you have 14 blue and 2 green — actually, yes, you can reach your goal on your own with the blue and green chips.\n\nLet’s recheck: your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles: (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (2,1)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B — that’s 5 blue tiles  \n(3,3) is G — green\n\nSo you need 5 blue and 1 green — you have 14 blue and 2 green — so yes, you can reach your goal alone.\n\nTherefore, neither of us needs the other to reach our goal. But since we're both at (0,0), we can potentially coordinate to save chips or shorten paths.\n\nBut since we are selfish, we only cooperate if we gain strictly more than we would otherwise.\n\nBut both of us can reach our goals independently, so no cooperation is required.\n\nBut here’s the key: if I *do* cooperate, I can save chips. But I don’t need to.\n\nWait — from my perspective: I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue.  \nMy shortest path uses 5 red and 1 green — I have both — so I can go.\n\nYour path: 5 blue, 1 green — you have both — so you can go.\n\nBut is there a cheaper path? No — all paths are 6 steps. So no difference in cost.\n\nBut note: if we both take the same path, we can both use only chips we have, so no trade needed.\n\nBut we both want to maximize our remaining chips. So if I take a path that uses fewer of my expensive chips — but I don't have expensive chips — I have 14 red, which is a lot.\n\nWait — maybe I can help you by letting you use my red and green chips? But you don’t need them — you have your own.\n\nWait — if I take a path that uses more green, I can push you to use more blue — but you have blue.\n\nBut here’s a thought: maybe we can *mutually* benefit from a trade if it lets us conserve chips.\n\nBut since we both have exactly enough to reach our goals on our own, there’s no benefit.\n\nWait — but look: my path: (0,0) → (0,1): R (need 1 red)  \n→ (1,1): R  \n→ (1,2): R  \n→ (1,3): R  \n→ (2,3): R — that’s 5 reds  \n→ (3,3): G — 1 green\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green → I can do it.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0): B  \n→ (2,0): B  \n→ (2,1): B  \n→ (3,1): B  \n→ (3,2): B — 5 B  \n→"

I have 14 red and 2 green — plenty.  \nYou can reach your goal using 5 blue and 1 green — you have 14 blue and 2 green — also plenty.  \n\nSince both of us can complete the game independently without any risk, and without needing to trade, there is no reason to cooperate.  \n\nBut let’s suppose we try to coordinate for a better outcome.  \nIf I help you with blue chips (which you have in abundance), why would I? You don’t need me.  \nIf you help me with red or green, you don’t need me either — I have 14 red and 2 green.  \n\nNo trade is necessary.  \nNo mutual benefit exists.  \n\nBut here’s the catch: if we both take longer paths that use fewer of our abundant chips, we might preserve more chips — but the path cost is the same: 6 moves. So even then, no benefit in time, just in chip usage.  \n\nMy current path uses 5 red and 1 green — I have 14 red, so I’ll have 9 red left.  \nYour path uses 5 blue and 1 green — you have 14 blue, so you’ll have 9 blue left.  \n\nNo need to trade.  \n\nBut if I were to **propose** a contract, it must **benefit me**.  \nSince I don’t need help, I only accept if I get **more points** than you do.  \n\nBut here’s a twist: if we **both** reach our goal, we both get 20 points plus 5 per remaining chip.  \nSo maximizing my chip count is key.  \n\nWhat if I take a path that uses more green? I have only 2 green — I want to save one.  \nSo best for me: minimize green usage.  \n\nI can go (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — that’s 5 blue and 1 green.  \nBut I have **0 blue chips** — so I **cannot** take this path.  \n\nSimilarly, you cannot take my red path — you have 0 red.  \n\nSo we are forced to use different paths because of color restrictions.  \n\nBut you can take the blue-heavy path — you have 14 blue.  \nI can take the red-heavy path — I have 14 red.  \n\nSo we each take our own optimal path.  \n\nNow, is there any way we can both benefit from a trade?  \n\nOnly if one of us can save chips by using the other’s color. But I have no blue, you have no red. So no cross-use.  \n\nBut: if I could use your blue path, I’d need 5 blue chips — I have 0. So I can’t.  \n\nSame for you.  \n\nTherefore, no benefit from trading.  \n\nBut here’s a possibility: if I **promise** to cover your blue moves, you could theoretically save your blue chips, but you already have plenty — you have 14, and only need 5. So why would you care?  \n\nAnd I don’t get any benefit from covering your moves — I’d be giving away chips that I don’t even have.  \n\nWait — in a trade, I am not losing chips — I am promising to **pay** for your movements — but if you move on a blue tile while I am covering for you, I must pay 1 blue chip. But I have 0 blue chips. So I **cannot** cover blue moves — because I have no blue chips to give.  \n\nSimilarly, you have no red chips — so you cannot cover red moves.  \n\nSo I **cannot** commit to covering any of your blue moves — because I don’t have blue chips.  \n\nTherefore, **I cannot make any trade that would help you**.  \n\nSimilarly, you cannot make any trade that would help me — because I don’t need red or green from you — I have 14 red and 2 green.  \n\nAnd you cannot cover red moves — you have no red chips.  \n\nSo even if we wanted to trade, **we cannot** — because we don’t have the chips to cover the other’s moves.  \n\nTherefore, **no trade is possible**.  \n\nSo I must conclude: **no cooperation is viable**, because:\n- I cannot afford to cover any of your moves (lack blue chips)\n- You cannot afford to cover any of my moves (lack red chips)\n- Neither of us needs the other\n- Neither of us can benefit from a trade\n\nI will therefore not accept any contract that requires"

Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B B R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

              "content": "I propose the following contract:\n\nIf I reach my goal, I will give you 5 points.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me 10 points.\n\nThis is a fair offer given our respective chip inventories and paths. I can reach my goal using mostly red and green chips, which you have a surplus of (you have 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red), while I have 14 red and 2 green but no blue — meaning you cannot help me with red or green unless I trade with you.\n\nHowever, I notice that your best path to the goal requires 5 blue chips and 1 green, which you have in abundance. My path requires only 5 red and 1 green — I have 14 red and 2 green, so I can complete my path alone without needing any help.\n\nBut if I help you, I can do so by covering your blue chip costs. Since you have 14 blue chips and I have 0, you would need my help to move on blue tiles. If we cooperate, you can use my cover on blue tiles, and I can do the same for red and green if you need.\n\nBut right now, I don’t need to trade at all — I can reach my goal using only my own chips. So I’m only willing to help you if I get more than you get, because I am selfish.\n\nSo here’s the twist: I can reach my goal on my own. You, however, cannot reach yours without help — you have 0 red, but your path requires 5 blue and 1 green, which you can do — wait, you have 14 blue and 2 green — actually, yes, you can reach your goal on your own with the blue and green chips.\n\nLet’s recheck: your path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles: (1,0)=B, (2,0)=B, (2,1)=B, (3,1)=B, (3,2)=B — that’s 5 blue tiles  \n(3,3) is G — green\n\nSo you need 5 blue and 1 green — you have 14 blue and 2 green — so yes, you can reach your goal alone.\n\nTherefore, neither of us needs the other to reach our goal. But since we're both at (0,0), we can potentially coordinate to save chips or shorten paths.\n\nBut since we are selfish, we only cooperate if we gain strictly more than we would otherwise.\n\nBut both of us can reach our goals independently, so no cooperation is required.\n\nBut here’s the key: if I *do* cooperate, I can save chips. But I don’t need to.\n\nWait — from my perspective: I have 14 red, 2 green, 0 blue.  \nMy shortest path uses 5 red and 1 green — I have both — so I can go.\n\nYour path: 5 blue, 1 green — you have both — so you can go.\n\nBut is there a cheaper path? No — all paths are 6 steps. So no difference in cost.\n\nBut note: if we both take the same path, we can both use only chips we have, so no trade needed.\n\nBut we both want to maximize our remaining chips. So if I take a path that uses fewer of my expensive chips — but I don't have expensive chips — I have 14 red, which is a lot.\n\nWait — maybe I can help you by letting you use my red and green chips? But you don’t need them — you have your own.\n\nWait — if I take a path that uses more green, I can push you to use more blue — but you have blue.\n\nBut here’s a thought: maybe we can *mutually* benefit from a trade if it lets us conserve chips.\n\nBut since we both have exactly enough to reach our goals on our own, there’s no benefit.\n\nWait — but look: my path: (0,0) → (0,1): R (need 1 red)  \n→ (1,1): R  \n→ (1,2): R  \n→ (1,3): R  \n→ (2,3): R — that’s 5 reds  \n→ (3,3): G — 1 green\n\nI have 14 red and 2 green → I can do it.\n\nYour path: (0,0) → (1,0): B  \n→ (2,0): B  \n→ (2,1): B  \n→ (3,1): B  \n→ (3,2): B — 5 B  \n→"

I have 14 red and 2 green — plenty.  \nYou can reach your goal using 5 blue and 1 green — you have 14 blue and 2 green — also plenty.  \n\nSince both of us can complete the game independently without any risk, and without needing to trade, there is no reason to cooperate.  \n\nBut let’s suppose we try to coordinate for a better outcome.  \nIf I help you with blue chips (which you have in abundance), why would I? You don’t need me.  \nIf you help me with red or green, you don’t need me either — I have 14 red and 2 green.  \n\nNo trade is necessary.  \nNo mutual benefit exists.  \n\nBut here’s the catch: if we both take longer paths that use fewer of our abundant chips, we might preserve more chips — but the path cost is the same: 6 moves. So even then, no benefit in time, just in chip usage.  \n\nMy current path uses 5 red and 1 green — I have 14 red, so I’ll have 9 red left.  \nYour path uses 5 blue and 1 green — you have 14 blue, so you’ll have 9 blue left.  \n\nNo need to trade.  \n\nBut if I were to **propose** a contract, it must **benefit me**.  \nSince I don’t need help, I only accept if I get **more points** than you do.  \n\nBut here’s a twist: if we **both** reach our goal, we both get 20 points plus 5 per remaining chip.  \nSo maximizing my chip count is key.  \n\nWhat if I take a path that uses more green? I have only 2 green — I want to save one.  \nSo best for me: minimize green usage.  \n\nI can go (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — that’s 5 blue and 1 green.  \nBut I have **0 blue chips** — so I **cannot** take this path.  \n\nSimilarly, you cannot take my red path — you have 0 red.  \n\nSo we are forced to use different paths because of color restrictions.  \n\nBut you can take the blue-heavy path — you have 14 blue.  \nI can take the red-heavy path — I have 14 red.  \n\nSo we each take our own optimal path.  \n\nNow, is there any way we can both benefit from a trade?  \n\nOnly if one of us can save chips by using the other’s color. But I have no blue, you have no red. So no cross-use.  \n\nBut: if I could use your blue path, I’d need 5 blue chips — I have 0. So I can’t.  \n\nSame for you.  \n\nTherefore, no benefit from trading.  \n\nBut here’s a possibility: if I **promise** to cover your blue moves, you could theoretically save your blue chips, but you already have plenty — you have 14, and only need 5. So why would you care?  \n\nAnd I don’t get any benefit from covering your moves — I’d be giving away chips that I don’t even have.  \n\nWait — in a trade, I am not losing chips — I am promising to **pay** for your movements — but if you move on a blue tile while I am covering for you, I must pay 1 blue chip. But I have 0 blue chips. So I **cannot** cover blue moves — because I have no blue chips to give.  \n\nSimilarly, you have no red chips — so you cannot cover red moves.  \n\nSo I **cannot** commit to covering any of your blue moves — because I don’t have blue chips.  \n\nTherefore, **I cannot make any trade that would help you**.  \n\nSimilarly, you cannot make any trade that would help me — because I don’t need red or green from you — I have 14 red and 2 green.  \n\nAnd you cannot cover red moves — you have no red chips.  \n\nSo even if we wanted to trade, **we cannot** — because we don’t have the chips to cover the other’s moves.  \n\nTherefore, **no trade is possible**.  \n\nSo I must conclude: **no cooperation is viable**, because:\n- I cannot afford to cover any of your moves (lack blue chips)\n- You cannot afford to cover any of my moves (lack red chips)\n- Neither of us needs the other\n- Neither of us can benefit from a trade\n\nI will therefore not accept any contract that requires"

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.\n- Only ONE color-quantity pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.
