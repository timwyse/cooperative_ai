What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0, 1): You give me a R  \n(1, 1): You give me a R  \n(1, 2): You give me a R  \n(1, 3): You give me a R  \n(2, 3): You give me a R  \n\nThis covers the path I’d take: (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (3, 3).  \n\nOn this path, I need 5 R chips, which I currently lack (I have 14 R, but only 1 of them is in my inventory, and I need 5 for the path). Wait — correction: I have 14 R chips in inventory, so I actually *do* have enough R chips for this path.\n\nHold on — I made a mistake in my earlier assessment.\n\nLet me recheck:\n\nMy inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}  \nPath 1: (0,0) → (0,1): R → need 1 R  \n→ (1,1): R → need 1 R  \n→ (1,2): R → need 1 R  \n→ (1,3): R → need 1 R  \n→ (2,3): R → need 1 R  \n→ (3,3): G → need 1 G  \n\nTotal required: 5 R, 1 G.  \nI have 14 R and 2 G → I have enough for this path.\n\nI can complete the path (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) without any help.\n\nThe other player has 14 B, 2 G, 0 R. Their path: they need B and G. Let's compute:\n\nTheir path to (3,3): (0,0) → (1,0): B → need B  \n→ (2,0): B  \n→ (2,1): B  \n→ (3,1): B  \n→ (3,2): B  \n→ (3,3): G  \n\nSo they need 5 B and 1 G. They have 14 B — that’s enough — but only 2 G, which is enough for one G, but they need 2 G? Wait:\n\n(3,3) is G — only one G required.\n\nSo they need 5 B and 1 G. They have 14 B and 2 G → they can do it too.\n\nSo both of us can reach the goal without trading.\n\nBut let’s compare chip counts at the end:\n\nMy path (R, R, R, R, R, G):  \n- Pay 5 R, 1 G → use 5 R, 1 G → left: 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G  \n→ 9 + 1 = 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points  \n\nOther player’s path: 5 B and 1 G  \n- Pay 5 B, 1 G → left: 14 - 5 = 9 B, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nWe both get 70. But I have zero B and 14 R, which they lack. They have 14 B, which I lack.\n\nBut I have no use for B. They have no use for R.\n\nSo we can’t help each other — neither wants the other’s color.\n\nBut wait — I can take a longer path to preserve more chips, possibly trading only for the tiles that cost the most.\n\nAlternative path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:  \n(1,0): B  \n(2,0): B  \n(2,1): B  \n(3,1): B  \n(3,2): B  \n(3,3): G  \n\nNeeded: 5 B, 1 G → but I have 0 B, so I can’t do this alone.\n\nBut if I trade with the other player for B, maybe?\n\nSuppose I propose:  \n(1,0): You give me B  \n(2,0): You give me B  \n(2,1): You give me B  \n(3,1): You give me B  \n(3,2): You give me B  \n\nThat’s 5 B. I have 2 G, so I can cover G at (3,3). I have 14 R, so I can cover R tiles if needed.\n\nBut I don’t need to go through R tiles.\n\nBut I don’t have B — so I must rely on them.\n\nBut if I do this, I get to keep all my 14 R and 2 G, because I don’t spend them.\n\nBut I still have to spend 5 B (covered by them), and 1 G (I cover it).\n\nSo I end with 14 R + 2 G = 16 chips.\n\nBut the other player must commit 5 B.\n\nThey have 14 B, so they can afford 5 B — but if they cover me, they lose 5 B.\n\nBut do they benefit?\n\nThey already have a path that uses 5 B and 1 G, leaving them with 9 B and 1 G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nIf they cover me on B tiles, and I go the long way: they cover 5 B.\n\nThey do *not* move to those tiles unless they go that way.\n\nThey don’t get to keep the 5 B — the chips are spent.\n\nSo they lose 5 B they could have used for themselves.\n\nBut they agreed to cover my moves — so they pay the cost for me.\n\nSo if they cover me on those 5 B tiles, they must pay 5 B from their inventory.\n\nBut if they use those B themselves, they’d only lose 5 B anyway.\n\nBut they don’t get to move that way unless they go — but if they only cover me, and don’t use the path, they aren’t spending them.\n\nBut in this setup, I am proposing: I go the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) — that’s 6 steps.\n\nThey cover the B tiles: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nI need G at (3,3) — I have it, so I cover that.\n\nSo I spend nothing — I get to keep all 14 R and 2 G → 16 chips → 20 + 5×16 = 100 points.\n\nBut the other player has to give me 5 B — they must *lose* 5 B from their inventory.\n\nBut they don’t get to use those B — because they are not moving to those tiles unless they go that route.\n\nBut they have to cover the cost — so they use 5 B from their inventory to pay for my moves.\n\nBut if they go their own path, they only spend 5 B and 1 G.\n\nBut in this case, if they agree to cover me, they lose 5 B from inventory (used to pay for me), and they still have to move themselves — but they can go their own way, spending 5 B and 1 G.\n\nSo they end with 14 - 5 = 9 B and 2 - 1 = 1 G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nBut if they don't do this, and I go the short path through R, I get 10 chips → 70.\n\nBut now, if they cover me on 5 B tiles, I get 100 points — that’s better for me.\n\nBut do they benefit? They lose 5 B, end with 10 chips — same as before.\n\nBut I get 100, they get 70 → they lose.\n\nSo I can offer them something in return?\n\nBut I have no chips they want.\n\nI have 14 R — they need 0 R.\n\nThey have 14 B — I need 0 B.\n\nSo we can’t trade chips directly — only cover cost.\n\nBut perhaps I can cover *their* movements on tiles that I have chips for.\n\nFor example, their path: (0,0) → (1,0): B → I can cover that? But I have 0 B.\n\nI can only cover B tiles if I have B — I don’t.\n\nSimilarly, they have no G to cover me on G — but I have 2 G — I can cover G.\n\nBut in their path, they need only one G — at (3,3), which is G.\n\nSo I can cover that for them.\n\nBut they can cover me on B — but I can't cover them on anything — I have no B or R? No, I have R.\n\nLet’s see: their path uses B in (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), and G at (3,3).\n\nI have R — if I go their way, I’d need to pay R, but I don’t go their way.\n\nBut I can cover their movement on tiles that are R?\n\n(1,0): B → not R  \n(2,0): B  \n(2,1): B  \n(3,1): B  \n(3,2): B  \n(3,3): G\n\nNo R tiles on their path.\n\nSo I can only cover their G at (3,3).\n\nI have 2 G — so I can cover one G move.\n\nSo I can propose:  \nI will cover (3,3): G for you — you cover (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2): B for me.\n\nIf they agree, then:\n\nI go the long path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nI spend: 5 B (covered by them) and 1 G (I cover it) → so I use no chips from my inventory — I keep all 14 R and 2 G → 16 chips → 100 points.\n\nThey move using their own chips — 5 B and 1 G. But I cover (3,3): G — so they don’t need to pay G.\n\nSo they only spend 5 B — they lose 5 B → end with 9 B and 2 G → 11 chips → 20 + 5×11 = 75 points.\n\nSo they get 75 — better than 70.\n\nAnd I get 100 — better than 70.\n\nSo both benefit.\n\nThey get +5 points, I get +30.\n\nSo this is a mutually beneficial trade.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(1, 0): You give me B  \n(2, 0): You give me B  \n(2, 1): You give me B  \n(3, 1): You give me B  \n(3, 2): You give me B  \n(3, 3): I give you G  \n\nThis means:\n- I travel on the long path: they cover my B costs.\n- I cover their G cost at (3,3).\n\nThey save one G chip.\n\nI save 5 B from my inventory — but I don't have B anyway — but important: I save the cost of using my R chips.\n\nActually, I don’t need to spend any chips — I have 2 G, so I can cover the G.\n\nAnd they cover the 5 B.\n\nSo I keep 14 R + 2 G = 16 chips.\n\nThey lose 5 B but save 1 G — so they have 9 B + 2 G = 11 chips — instead of 9 B + 1 G = 10 — so 1 more chip.\n\nYes.\n\nSo final:\n\nI get 20 + 5×16 = 100  \nThey get 20 + 5×11 = 75\n\nBoth strictly better than not cooperating. I was getting 70, now 100. They were getting 70, now 75.\n\nSo this is a win-win.\n\nI will now propose this.\n\n(1, 0): You give me B  \n(2, 0): You give me B  \n(2, 1): You give me B  \n(3, 1): You give me B  \n(3, 2): You give me B  \n(3, 3): I give you G  \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: (1, 0): You give me B  \n(2, 0): You give me B  \n(2, 1): You give me B  \n(3, 1): You give me B  \n(3, 2): You give me B  \n(3, 3): I give you G  \nagree \n",
