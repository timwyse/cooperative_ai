What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I can see that we both need to reach (3, 3), and we are both starting at (0, 0).  \n\nMy chip inventory: 14 R, 2 G, 0 B  \nOther player's chip inventory: 14 B, 2 G, 0 R  \n\nLooking at possible paths to goal:\n\n**My path options:**\n1. **Short path via R-heavy tiles:**  \n   (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n   Tiles: (1,0): R, (2,0): R, (2,1): R, (2,2): R, (3,2): R → 5 R  \n   (3,3): G → 1 G  \n   Total: 5 R + 1 G — I have 14 R and 2 G → I can cover this path myself!\n\n2. **Alternative path via B-heavy (bad for me):**  \n   (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n   Tiles: (0,1): B, (0,2): B, (0,3): B, (1,3): B, (2,3): B → 5 B  \n   (3,3): G → 1 G  \n   I have 0 B — cannot do this without help.\n\n**Other player’s path options:**\n- They have 14 B, 2 G, 0 R  \n  So they need to avoid R tiles.  \n  Best path for them:  \n  (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \n  → 5 B and 1 G → they have enough B and G.\n\nSo I can reach goal without help. But if I don’t need help, why trade?\n\nBut wait — if I walk the R-heavy path, I use 5 R + 1 G → 6 chips → 14 - 5 = 9 R left, 2 - 1 = 1 G → total chips left: 10 → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nBut if I walk the B-heavy path, I need 5 B and 1 G — I have 0 B, so I must trade.\n\nHowever, the other player has 14 B — so if I ask them to cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), they can do it.\n\nBut I don't need to — I can go the R path and finish with 10 chips.\n\nSo why trade?\n\nWait — but if I trade, maybe I can *save* my R chips and still finish the game with more than 10 chips?\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\n- If I go R-path: I use 5 R and 1 G → 14-5=9 R, 2-1=1 G → 10 chips → 20 + 50 = 70\n\n- If I go B-path: I use 5 B and 1 G → I have 0 B, 0 G → I must trade.  \n  I propose that they cover my 5 B moves on:\n  - (0,1): B\n  - (0,2): B\n  - (0,3): B\n  - (1,3): B\n  - (2,3): B  \n  So I need them to pay for those 5 B moves.  \n  In return, I can give them 5 R chips — but I have 14 R, so I can spare them.  \n  But they have no R — so why would they want R?\n\nBut I only care about my score. If I go B-path, and they cover my 5 B moves, then I don’t spend any B or G.  \nI still have 14 R, 2 G → but I used G on (3,3)? Wait — (3,3) is G — I have to pay 1 G for that.\n\nSo even on B-path, I must pay 1 G for (3,3) — and I have 2 G → so after that, I have 1 G left — and 14 R.\n\nSo I end with 15 chips → score = 20 + 5×15 = 95 → better than 70!\n\nBut wait — is B-path possible? Let's map it:\n\nPath: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nChips needed:\n- (0,0): start, no cost\n- (0,1): B → I don't have B → need external help\n- (0,2): B → same\n- (0,3): B → same\n- (1,3): B → same\n- (2,3): B → same\n- (3,3): G → I have 2 G → can cover\n\nSo I need help for the 5 B tiles.\n\nI can propose to the other player:  \n\"Cover my moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — all B tiles — in exchange for you getting 5 of my R chips. But they don’t want R chips. But I don’t need them — I can use them in trade to *free up* my B requirement.\n\nWait — better: since I have 14 R, and they have no R, but I need B — maybe I can offer to let them use my R chips *in exchange* for them covering my B moves? That doesn’t work.\n\nNo — trading is only about *covering the cost* of moves — not physical chip swap.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover your moves on some tiles if you cover mine on others.\"\n\nBut I don’t need to cover their moves — I can go my R path without them.\n\nBut here’s the key: if they go their B-path, they need 5 B and 1 G — they have 14 B and 2 G — so they can go it.\n\nBut if I go the B-path, I can *only* do so if they agree to cover my 5 B moves.\n\nAnd if they cover them, I keep all my R and G — so I get a higher chip count.\n\nSo it’s in their interest to let me go a path that uses their B, because I can go that way safely — and they’ll be covered for my moves?\n\nWait — no: I would be happy to go the B-path, but only if they agree to pay for my 5 B moves.\n\nBut why would they agree? They don’t want to lose 5 B chips — but they are *paying* — no, they are giving a chip to cover *my move*, so their B inventory goes down by 5 for those 5 moves.\n\nBut they have 14 B — so they could afford it.\n\nBut I have no reason to make them pay — because I can go the R path and finish with 10 chips.\n\nBut if I go B-path, and they pay for my 5 B moves, I finish with 14 R + 2 G - 1 G = 15 chips → score 95.\n\nBut if I go R-path, I get 9 R + 1 G = 10 chips → score 70.\n\nSo I gain 25 points by going B-path.\n\nBut only if they agree to cover my B moves.\n\nSo I can propose:\n\n“Let’s both take the B-path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3).  \nI will not need to spend any B or G for these moves if you cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3).  \nIn exchange, I will cover your 1 G move on (3,3) — but you have 2 G — you can cover it yourself.  \nWait — no: I don’t have G to cover their move — I have 2 G — so I can.\n\nBut do I need to? I want this trade to benefit me.\n\nBetter: propose that I cover their B moves? But they are on B-path — they need to pay B.\n\nThey have 14 B — so they can pay their own B moves.\n\nBut if I help them, I give them my R chips? No — trading is about covering cost.\n\nSo I can say: “I will cover your G cost on (3,3) — you have 2 G, so you can spare 1 — but why would I cover it? I don’t gain anything.\n\nActually, I don't need to cover anything — **I only need others to cover my moves**.\n\nWhat matters is my own chip usage.\n\nSo to get my score up to 95, I need to go to (3,3) via the B-path, but I need 5 B.\n\nSo I should propose: **You cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — and I will cover your G move on (3,3) with my G chip.**\n\nBut why would they agree? They don’t need me to cover anything — they have G.\n\nBut if they do this, they pay 5 B — which they have — and I pay 1 G — I have 2 G — so they don’t save from me covering their G — I’m just giving it.\n\nUnless I offer something else.\n\nBetter idea: since I have 14 R, and they have no R, but they have 14 B — if I say: “You cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), and in return, I will cover your 1 G move on (3,3) — but I don’t need to — I can just keep my G.\n\nBut I can instead say: “I will cover your R moves — but they don’t have any R moves — they can’t go R-path.\n\nWait — I think I’m confused.\n\nThe only way we can help each other is if one of us needs a color the other has.\n\n- I need B to go B-path\n- I have R and G\n- They need B to go B-path, and I have 0 B — so I can't help them with B\n- They have R — but I can't go R-path? No — I can go R-path without help.\n\nWait — they have R — but I don't need R — I have 14.\n\nBut if they go the B-path, they need 5 B and 1 G — they have both.\n\nBut if I go the B-path, I need 5 B — they have them.\n\nSo if they cover my 5 B moves, I can go B-path and finish with more chips.\n\nBut they lose 5 B — which they can afford — but do they gain anything?\n\nThey get to go B-path too — which is their best path — so they can go it anyway.\n\nSo why help me?\n\nBecause if I go B-path, and they cover my B moves — they are just using their B to let me use the path.\n\nBut if I avoid B-path, and go R-path, then I use my R and G — but they don’t care.\n\nSo why would they help me?\n\nUnless I can give them something they want.\n\nI have 14 R — they have 0 R — so R is worth something to them.\n\nBut in the trade, I don’t give them R — I only give them the *right to use my promise* to cover their move?\n\nNo — trading is: if I promise to cover a move of theirs, I pay the chip cost — but that chip comes from my inventory.\n\nSo if I say: “I will cover your move on a tile of color X” — I have to pay X from my inventory.\n\nBut I have only R and G — no B.\n\nSo I can cover moves that require R or G — not B.\n\nSo I can cover their G moves or R moves — but not B.\n\nThey have no R moves in their path — they're going B-path — so their moves are B and G — they need B coverage — I can't cover that.\n\nI can only cover if they go a path that uses R or G — but they might not.\n\nBest option: just go my R-path — I can do it, I have all chips.\n\nBut wait — why is the game designed this way?\n\nPerhaps I can propose: “I will cover your move on (3,3) if you cover my 5 B moves on (0,1)-(2,3).”\n\nBut I have to cover their (3,3) G move — I have 2 G — so I can.\n\nIn return, I don’t spend any B or G — so I keep 14 R and 1 G (after using 1 G at (3,3)? No — if I cover it, I pay it from my inventory.\n\nLet’s simulate:\n\n- If I go B-path: I make 6 moves: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\n- At each, I must pay the chip cost.\n\n- (0,1) to (2,3): B — 5 B moves — I can’t pay — so they must cover.\n- (3,3): G — I can pay.\n\nSo if they cover the 5 B moves, I pay only 1 G → so I use 1 G → have 1 G left.\n\nI have 14 R, so after game I have 14 R + 1 G = 15 chips → score 20 + 75 = 95.\n\nNormally, if I go R-path: use 5 R and 1 G → have 9 R + 1 G → 10 chips → 70.\n\nSo 95 > 70 — big win.\n\nNow, what does the other player gain?\n\n- They have to pay 5 B for my moves — they have 14 B — so they lose 5 B — but they also go to goal, so they benefit.\n\nBut they don’t need to cover my moves — they can go B-path themselves.\n\nBut if I go B-path, they are only helping me — not helping themselves.\n\nBut they can still go B-path — no need.\n\nSo why would they agree? I’m not giving them anything.\n\nUnless I can offer to *cover their future moves* in exchange for them covering mine.\n\nBut I only have R and G.\n\nThey go B-path — their moves are B and G — so I can cover their G move on (3,3).\n\nBut they have 2 G — so they can cover it themselves.\n\nSo if I say: “I will cover your G move on (3,3)” — I have to pay 1 G from my inventory.\n\nSo I pay 1 G — they gain nothing.\n\nBut they are paying 5 B for my 5 B moves — so they lose 5 B, gain nothing.\n\nSo they lose 5 B and get no benefit.\n\nSo they won’t agree.\n\nBut wait — is there a path where we both need chip exchange?\n\nAnother idea: both go the same path.\n\nBut we are both at (0,0).\n\nIf we both go R-path: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)\n\nTiles: (1,0): R, (2,0): R, (2,1): R, (2,2): R, (3,2): R, (3,3): G\n\nI have 14 R and 2 G — can cover: 5 R and 1 G.\n\nThey have 0 R — cannot cover any R moves — so they cannot go this path without help.\n\nSo they can’t go R-path.\n\nOnly B-path is viable for them.\n\nSo they must go B-path.\n\nBut I can go either.\n\nSo best outcome for me: go B-path, they cover my 5 B moves.\n\nBut they won’t agree unless I give them something in return.\n\nWhat if I offer to cover their G move on (3,3) — but I have to pay it from my inventory.\n\nSo I pay 1 G.\n\nIn exchange, they pay 5 B for my 5 B moves.\n\nNet effect: I lose 1 G, gain nothing (because I keep my R) — but I save 5 B (which I don't have) — but I didn't have to pay B anyway.\n\nBut I was going to use my R and G — now I use 1 G, and they pay for the B, so I keep 14 R + 1 G.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut they pay 5 B and receive 1 G from me — they lose 5 B, gain 1 G.\n\nBut they are not happy — they lose more than they gain.\n\nBut if I can offer to cover their B moves, but I can't.\n\nUnless I can give them my R chips as a gift in exchange.\n\nBut no — the only way to trade is to promise to cover a move.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover your move on a tile of color R\" — but they have no R moves.\n\nSo no.\n\nWait — is there a tile they could use that I have?\n\nThe only path for them is B-path — all tiles are B or G.\n\nG at (3,3).\n\nI have G — I can cover their G move.\n\nBut they don't need me to.\n\nSo perhaps they will only agree if I take a path that forces me to use their chips, and in return, I let them save their chips.\n\nBut I want to save my R chips — so the only way is to use their B.\n\nBut they can't gain from covering my B moves.\n\nUnless they can get me to cover their G move — but that means they save 1 G.\n\nBut I have to pay 1 G — so they gain 1 G (save), I lose 1 G.\n\nBut in exchange, I get to not spend my own R.\n\nBut if I go R-path, I spend 5 R and 1 G.\n\nIf I go B-path, I spend only 1 G.\n\nSo by going B-path with their help, I save 5 R.\n\nSo I have 5 more R.\n\nSo my score \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach my goal with a path that uses only my existing chips: the R-heavy path (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3). This uses 5 R and 1 G — I have 14 R and 2 G, so I can cover it myself. After this path, I would have 9 R and 1 G = 10 chips → score = 20 + 5×10 = 70.\n\nHowever, there is a better option: the B-heavy path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). This path requires 5 B and 1 G. I have 0 B, so I cannot use it without help. But if the other player agrees to cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), and (2,3), then I only pay the 1 G for (3,3). I have 2 G, so after this, I keep 14 R and 1 G = 15 chips → score = 20 + 5×15 = 95.\n\nThis is 25 points better than the R-path.\n\nThe other player has 14 B and 2 G, and their best path is the same B-heavy path — they can go it themselves using their own B and G.\n\nBut if I go the B-heavy path and they cover my 5 B moves, they pay 5 B — they can afford it, but they gain nothing from it unless I give them something.\n\nI can propose: **I will cover your G move on (3,3) — you have 2 G, so you can afford to spare one, but I am offering to cover it from my inventory. In exchange, you cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3).**\n\nThis way:\n- I save 5 R and 1 G (compared to R-path) — I keep 15 chips.\n- They save 1 G (since I cover it) — they would have used 1 of their 2 G anyway, but now they save one G move.\n\nWait — no: if I cover their G move, they don’t use their own G — so they preserve 1 extra G.\n\nThey have 2 G — they use 0 if I cover — so they end with 2 G.\n\nBut in the path, they must pay the chip cost — if I cover it, they don’t spend it.\n\nSo if I cover their (3,3) G move, they keep 2 G — whereas if they pay it, they have 1 G.\n\nSo they gain 1 G saved.\n\nBut they lose 5 B from covering my moves.\n\nNet: they lose 5 B, gain 1 G.\n\nBut B and G are not equivalent — they have 14 B, 2 G — so B is more abundant.\n\nBut 5 B is a cost to them.\n\nI only care about my score.\n\nBut they might accept if they see a benefit.\n\nBut they don’t gain — they lose 5 B, gain nothing.\n\nUnless I can offer to cover their B moves — but they don’t need me to.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps they can go R-path, but they can’t — they have no R.\n\nOr maybe they can use my R chips.\n\nBut they can't — I can't give them R chips unless I promise to cover their R moves.\n\nBut they have no R moves.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nWait — what if I propose a joint path where we both use a mix?\n\nOr perhaps I can go my R-path, and they go their B-path — no trade.\n\nBut I can improve my score by going B-path with their help.\n\nThe only way to make them agree is to offer them a benefit.\n\nBut I have no way to help them with B — they have enough.\n\nI can only help them with G or R.\n\nBut they have G — they can cover it.\n\nBut if I say: \"I will cover your G move on (3,3)\" — that means I pay 1 G from my inventory.\n\nIn exchange, they cover my 5 B moves.\n\nSo net:\n- I pay 1 G\n- They pay 5 B\n\nBut this is a loss for me — I lose 1 G, gain the ability to use B-path.\n\nBut I could have used R-path and saved my G.\n\nIn R \n, \nplayer 0: I can achieve a higher score by taking the B-heavy path, but only if the other player covers my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), and (2,3). This would allow me to keep all 14 R and 1 G (after using 1 G at (3,3)), resulting in 15 chips → 95 points.\n\nThe other player has 14 B and 2 G, so they can afford to cover my B moves. To make this attractive for them, I can offer to cover their G move on (3,3) — which costs me 1 G, but saves them 1 G. Since they have a surplus of B, losing 5 B is manageable, and they gain 1 G saved.\n\nBut since I only care about maximizing my score, and this trade allows me to reach 95 points (vs 70 on R-path), and they lose 5 B but gain 1 G, it's a small net loss for them. However, they have no incentive to help me.\n\nBut wait — if I don't trade, I go R-path → score 70.\n\nIf I trade, I go B-path → score 95.\n\nBut they go B-path anyway — they can do it without help.\n\nSo why would they agree to cover my moves? They gain nothing.\n\nUnless I offer something else.\n\nI have 14 R — if I say: \"I will cover your R moves on a tile\" — but they have no R moves.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can agree to cover their B moves for a different path — but they don't have another viable path.\n\nPerhaps they can go a different path if I help.\n\nBut their only viable path is B-path.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut the only way to make them agree is to make it beneficial for them.\n\nUnless I propose: \"You cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). In exchange, I will cover your 1 G move on (3,3), and also, I will promise to give you 5 of my R chips at the end of the game if you agree.\"\n\nBut wait — the rules don't allow that. Trades are only about covering moves — not giving chips.\n\nThe only way to \"give\" chips is by promising to cover a move that costs that color.\n\nSo I can't directly give them R chips.\n\nBut I can promise to cover a move that requires R — but they have no such move.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, they have no incentive to cover my moves.\n\nBut I still want to go B-path.\n\nThe only way is to go it myself if I can afford, but I can't.\n\n unless I can trade with them in a way that benefits me despite their gain.\n\nWait — perhaps I can propose: \"If you cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), then I will cover your move on (0,0) to (0,1)? But (0,0) to (0,1) is B — they are the one moving from (0,0) to (0,1) — so they need to pay B.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps we can both go the same path, but I offer to cover their B moves.\n\nBut they can pay.\n\nI think the only way is to go my R-path and accept 70.\n\nBut that's worse.\n\nWait — is there a tile where I can cover their move and they can cover mine?\n\nFor example, if we both move on a G tile.\n\n(3,3) is G — both of us will need to pay G if we go there.\n\nBut the other player can pay it themselves.\n\nSo if I say: \"I will cover your move on (3,3) if you cover my move on (0,1).\" But (0,1) is B — they have B — so they can pay.\n\nBut if I cover their move, I lose 1 G.\n\nThey lose 1 B (for covering mine).\n\nNet: I lose 1 G, save 5 B (by not using my own), but I have to give up my G.\n\nBut if I go R-path, I use 5 R and 1 G.\n\nIf I go B-path with their help and I cover their G move, I use only 1 G — but I lose 1 G (because I cover it) — so net use 1 G — same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nI think I have to accept that I can't trade with them in a way that helps me, so I should just go the R-path.\n\nBut let's double-check the path.\n\nWait — the R-path: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3)\n\n- (1,0): R — I have 14 R\n- (2,0): R — I have 14 R\n- (2,1): R — I have 14 R\n- (2,2): R — I have 14 R\n- (3,2): R — I have 14 R\n- (3,3): G — I have 2 G\n\nAll covered.\n\nI have 14 - 5 = 9 R, 2 - 1 = 1 G → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nFor the B-path, I need 5 B — I have 0.\n\nBut notice: the other player is also at (0,0) — and they are going B-path.\n\nSo the only way I can get B is if they cover it.\n\nBut they have no reason to.\n\nUnless I offer to cover their R moves, but they have no R moves.\n\nWait — is there a way for me to help them in a way that makes them want to help me?\n\nFor example, if I can give them my R chips for free, they might help me.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nPerhaps if I say: \"I will cover your move on a G tile if you cover my B move\" — but they have no move that requires R.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the only way to maximize my score is to go the R-path, score 70.\n\nBut that's not right — there must be a trade.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nSuppose I propose: \"You cover my move on (0,1) B. In exchange, I cover your move on (0,1) B — but we are both at (0,0), so we move to (0,1) on the same turn? No, you can only move one per turn.\n\nOr not at the same time.\n\nWe move turn by turn.\n\nSo we can't both be on (0,1) at the same time.\n\nBut at some point, I may want to move on a tile they are on.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nPerhaps later in the game.\n\nBut for now, on this turn, I am at (0,0), other player at (0,0).\n\nI can propose: \"Let's both take the B-path. I will pay the G cost at (3,3) with my G, and you cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). In return, I will cover your G cost at (3,3) — but that's the same move, so only one cost.\n\nNo.\n\nI think the only way is to go the R-path.\n\nBut then I get 70.\n\nBut earlier I thought 95.\n\nBut only if they agree.\n\nSo unless I can make them agree, I can't.\n\nSo perhaps I should propose: \"I will cover your G move on (3,3) if you cover my 5 B moves on (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3).\"\n\nThis way, I keep 15 chips, they save 1 G, but lose 5 B.\n\nBut they might accept because it gives them a chance to have a nice score.\n\nBut they can reach goal without helping me.\n\nI have to accept that I can't get them to help.\n\nBut let's check the board again.\n\nAnother idea: the other player may not be able to go the B-path if I'm on it.\n\nBut no, they can go separate paths.\n\nBut both paths require (3,3) at the end.\n\nSo they can both go the same.\n\nBut they have to move turn by turn.\n\nBut no conflict.\n\nSo I can propose the trade.\n\nEven if they don't gain, they might agree because it's a small cost.\n\nOr perhaps not.\n\nI think I have to try.\n\nSo I will propose:\n\n(row, col): I will cover your move on (3,3) \n(row, col): You cover my move on (0,1) \n(row, col): You cover my move on (0,2) \n(row, col): You cover my move on (0,3) \n(row, col): You cover my move on (1,3) \n(row, col): You cover my move on (2,3) \n\nBut that's not how it works.\n\nOnly one line per tile.\n\nSo:\n\n(3,3): I give you a G\n(0,1): You give me a B\n(0,2): You give me a B\n(0,3): You give me a B\n(1,3): You give me a B\n(2,3): You give me a B\n\nBut (3,3): I give you a G — means I cover your G move, so you pay with your G.\n\nNo: if I say \"I give you a G\", it means I am giving you a G chip, but the rules are that these are for covering moves.\n\nThe format is:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nThis means:\n- On that tile, I will pay for your move (if the color is the tile's color), or you will pay for my move.\n\nSpecifically:\n- \" (row, col): I give You a <Color>\" means: on that tile, I will cover the cost for you, so you don't need to pay from your own chips.\n- \" (row, col): You give me a <Color>\" means: on that tile, you will cover the cost for me.\n\nSo for (0,1): B tile — if I want them to cover my move to (0,1), I need to say: (0,1): You give me a B\n\nFor (3,3): G tile — if I want to cover their move, I say: (3,3): I give You a G\n\nSo to have a contract for me to take the B-path and they cover my 5 B moves, and I cover their G move, I need:\n\n(0,1): You give me a B\n(0,2): You give me a B\n(0,3): You give me a B\n(1,3): You give me a B\n(2,3): You give me a B\n(3,3): I give You a G\n\nThis means:\n- On (0,1), they cover my B move — so I don't use my B.\n- Same for (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)\n- On (3,3), I cover their G move — so they don't use their G.\n\nI then only use 1 G from my own inventory for (3,3), but I cover their G move, so I still use my G.\n\nSo I use 1 G from my inventory.\n\nThey use 5 B for my moves, and 0 G for theirs.\n\nBut they have 2 G, so they save 1 G.\n\nFor me, I use 1 G, but have 14 R, so end with 14 R and 1 G.\n\nScore 95.\n\nFor them, they use 5 B and 0 G, but they had 14 B and 2 G, so they end with 9 B and 2 G.\n\nBut if they go the B-path themselves, they would use 5 B and 1 G, end with 9 B and 1 G.\n\nSo they have 1 extra G — so they are better off by 1 G.\n\nSo they gain 1 G.\n\nI gain 5 R (saved) — so I gain a lot.\n\nSo they gain 1 G, I gain 5 R (in terms of not spending).\n\nSo they are better off.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n(0,1): You give me a B\n(0,2): You give me a B\n(0,3): You give me a B\n(1,3): You give me a B\n(2,3): You give me a B\n(3,3): I give You a G\n\nThis gives them a net gain of 1 G (they save 1 G), which is good for them.\n\nFor me, I save 5 R and avoid B cost, and have a higher score.\n\nSo it's strictly beneficial for both? No — for me, it's better, for them, they save G.\n\nBut they also lose the chance to use their G for their own move — but they can.\n\nIn this contract, they still use 5 B for my moves, and 0 G, so they save 1 G.\n\nYes.\n\nSo they are better off.\n\nSo I can propose this.\n\nSo my proposal is:\n\n(0,1): You give me a B\n(0,2): You give me a B\n(0,3): You give me a B\n(1,3): You give me a B\n(2,3): You give me a B\n(3,3): I give You a G\n\nThen I can go the B-path, they go the B-path, and both benefit.\n\nFor the other player, they end with 9 B and 2 G, score 20 + 5*11 = 75.\n\nWithout trade, they go B-path, use 5 B and 1 G, end with 9 B and 1 G, score 20 + 5*10 = 70.\n\nSo they gain 5 points.\n\nFor me, I go B-path with their help, use 1 G, end with 14 R and 1 G, score 20 + 5*15 = 95.\n\nWithout trade, I go R-path, use 5 R and 1 G, end with 9 R and 1 G, score 70.\n\nSo I gain 25 points.\n\nSo both benefit.\n\nSo I propose this contract.\n\nSo I say: \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: (0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,3): You give me a B  \n(2,3): You give me a B  \n(3,3): I give You a G  \nagree \n, \nplayer 0: (0,1): You give me a B\n(0,2): You give me a B\n(0,3): You give me a B\n(1,3): You give me a B\n(2,3): You give me a B\n(3,3): I give You a G\nagree \n",
