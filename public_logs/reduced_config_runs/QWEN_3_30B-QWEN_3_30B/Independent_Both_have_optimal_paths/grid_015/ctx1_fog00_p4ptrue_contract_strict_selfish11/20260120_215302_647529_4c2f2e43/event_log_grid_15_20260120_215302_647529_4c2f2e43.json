Last error: No JSON-like content found in response\nLast raw response: {\n  \"rationale\": \"I am currently at (1, 2), and my goal is (3, 3). The shortest path is 2 steps: (1,2) → (2,3) → (3,3), but this requires two moves: first to (2,3), which is red (R), and then to (3,3), which is green (G). I currently have 0 red chips, so I cannot afford the move to (2,3) unless someone covers it. Alternatively, a feasible path that uses tiles I can cover is: (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3). However, (1,3) is blue (B), and I have 11 blue chips — enough to cover that move. Then (2,3) is red, requiring R chip; I don’t have any R chips, and no contract currently covers red for me on (2,3). But looking at the contract terms, I notice that the other player has promised to cover me for red on (1,1), and also, I have previously agreed to cover them for red on several nodes including (1,0), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2). However, none of those include (2,3), which is outside the contract’s scope.\\n\\nBut now let’s reconsider the alternative path to goal that was shown in the game status: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] — this is only 2 steps, with costs: R (1), G (1). That’s a very short path! However, I am currently at (1,2), not near (3,1). To reach that path, I must go through (2,2) or (2,1), etc., which may be costly.\\n\\nWait — another possibility: from (1,2), moving to (2,2) is red (R), which I don’t have chips for. (1,2) → (2,2): tile color R → need 1 R chip, but I have 0. Can’t do that move without help.\\n\\nNext, what about moving right from (1,2) to (1,3)? Tile color is B (blue), and I have 11 blue chips — YES, I can afford this. And from (1,3), next move to (2,3) is red again — still no red chips. So even if I go via (1,3), I still hit a red tile at (2,3).\\n\\nSo to avoid red tiles entirely, I should find a path that avoids red altogether. Let’s check board layout:\\n\\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: R R B B\\nRow 2: B R R B\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nFrom (1,2): current position.\\n(1,2) → (1,3): B → OK, cost 1 B\\n(1,3) → (2,3): R → need 1 R → not possible\\n(1,2) → (2,2): R → need 1 R → not possible\\n(1,2) → (1,1): R → need 1 R → not possible\\n(1,2) → (1,1) leads to blocked path\\n\\nWait — all adjacent cells from (1,2) are either blue (only (1,3)), or red (all others). Only (1,3) is accessible with my current chips.\\n\\nSo the only valid move I can make right now is to (1,3), paying 1 blue chip. After that, I’ll be at (1,3), inventory: B = 10.\\n\\nFrom there, I can go to (2,3): red — I don’t have red chips. But wait — in the contract, **the other player has given me** a promise to cover red on (1,1), but not (2,3). No direct coverage for (2,3).\\n\\nHowever, consider this: could we agree on a trade? If I propose to use their red coverage for one move to (2,3), and in return offer them something they want?\\n\\nBut remember: I only cooperate if *I* strictly benefit. Right now, if I go to (1,3), I’m spending 1 blue chip and making progress. But then I’m stuck because I can’t proceed further unless I get red coverage.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the contract more effectively. Notice: I have promised the other player to cover red on (3"
