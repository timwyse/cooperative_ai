This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

I can complete the path without trading, and I’ll end with 14 - 5 = 9 red, and 2 - 1 = 1 green, totaling 10 chips.  \n\nSo my final score would be:  \n20 (goal) + 5 × 10 = 20 + 50 = **70 points**.  \n\nNow, let's look at the other player.  \nThey are at (0, 0), goal is (3, 3).  \nTheir chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} — no red chips.  \n\nThey cannot use any path that requires red chips.  \nThe shortest path using only their chips?

Only if one of us can reduce the cost of their journey by trading.  \n\nBut in this case:  \n- I don’t need blue or green — I have green but don’t need more. I have red but don’t need to use more than 5.  \n- They don’t need red — they have zero, but I have 14.  \n\nBut I can’t gain from trading red for blue, because I don’t need blue for my path.  \nSimilarly, they can’t gain from trading blue for red — they don’t need red.  \n\nSo **no mutual benefit from trade or cooperation**.  \n\nTherefore, the best outcome is for both of us to go our own way, independently.  \n\nI don’t need to negotiate. I don’t need to give them any points. I can get 70 points on my own.  \n\nBut if I help them, I get no benefit — and I risk using up my chips on a longer or costlier path if I deviate.  \n\nSo I will **not cooperate**.  \n\nBut since the game requires us to negotiate, I will propose a contract that protects my interest.  \n\nProposed contract:  \nIf I reach my goal, I will give you **0 points**.  \nIf you reach your goal, you will give me **0 points**.  \n\nThis ensures I get my full 70 points, and you get your 70 points — no risk, no cost to me.  \n\nBut if you insist on helping me, you’d have to give me more than 0 to make it worth your while — but since you don't need me, you won’t.  \n\nSo I’ll stand firm: **no trade, no points exchange**.  \n\nFinal offer:  \n\"If I reach my goal, I will give you 0"
