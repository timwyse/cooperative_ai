By moving now, I will reach my goal immediately, securing 20 points for completion, plus 5 points per remaining chip (I will have 1 green chip left after the move, and 9 red chips, so 5 × (1 + 9) = 50 points from chips). Total score: 70. Any delay or alternative path would reduce my chip count unnecessarily or risk not reaching the goal. The other player is at (3, 2), which is adjacent to the goal and also needs a green chip to move to (3, 3); however, I do not care about their score.
