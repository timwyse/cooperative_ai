Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Only if the trade gives you **more chips at the end** than 70.\n\nSuppose you propose:  \n\"I will cover your movement on all B tiles along your path, if you cover my movement on R tiles along my path.\"\n\nBut wait: your path uses **R tiles** (on (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)) — which are all R.\n\nThe other player has **0 R**, so they cannot pay for R moves — they don't have R chips.\n\nSo: **you cannot trade R payments with them**, because they don’t have R.\n\nBut — your path **does not require them to pay** — you can go alone.\n\nNow, what if they go via B-path?\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThey need: 5 B, 1 G — they have **14 B, 2 G** → sufficient.\n\nThey can do it alone → score: 20 + 5×(14-5 + 2-1) = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70\n\nSame score.\n\nSo both of us can independently reach the goal with no trade — and both score 70.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nCould trade allow one of us to preserve more chips?\n\nOnly if we can avoid using high-cost chips.\n\nBut you **don’t have B**, so you must use R or G. You have R (14), so using R is fine.\n\nNo benefit in trading B for you, because:\n- You can’t pay B anyway (you have 0 B)\n- You don't have the other player's chip (R) → they can’t pay R moves for you.\n\nWait: **if you trade**, you could ask them to cover your R moves — but they have **0 R**, so they can't.  \nSo no way for them to finance your R moves.\n\nSimilarly, they can’t finance your G (you have G), but they have G too — but you don’t need them for your path.\n\nSo: **no possible trade benefits you**.\n\nBut could there be a trade where *you* benefit?\n\nOnly if you can avoid using your **G** or **R** chips — but you can’t — you have to use them.\n\nAlternative idea: Could we coordinate so both of us take paths that are longer, but allow each to save more chips?\n\nBut that reduces chip count — and since score is 20 + 5×chips, **more chips = better**.\n\nSo shorter paths are better if they avoid spending.\n\nBut both paths are length 6.\n\nBut you are already on a path that uses your surplus chips (R) — you have 14 R, only need 5 → 9 left → perfect.\n\nYou have 2 G, need 1 → 1 left.\n\nSo you are already doing **optimally** — no better option exists for you.\n\nNow: **even if they offer a trade, must you accept it? Only if you strictly benefit**.\n\nBut if you accept any trade where they pay for your R moves, but they don’t have R → impossible.\n\nAny trade they propose must involve you giving something they want (e.g., B) in exchange for them giving R or G.\n\nBut they need **B** — you have **B** (14), they have none.\n\nSo: you could offer to cover their B moves in return for their R moves? But they have **0 R** → they can’t give R.\n\nSo **no valid trade can be arranged** that actually transfers chips.\n\nAny proposal like:\n- (0,1): You give B, I give R — but they have no R → can’t give R\n- (1,1): You give B, I give R — again, no R\n\nSo no trade is possible that they can satisfy.\n\nHence, **they cannot propose a feasible trade that benefits you**.\n\nBut wait — could you propose something that makes **them** cover your R moves?\n\nOnly if they had R — but they don’t — so they can't promise R.\n\nSo you **cannot** accept any contract that asks you to commit to paying for their moves on R tiles — because they can't deliver on R.\n\nTherefore: **no valid contract exists that allows either of us to avoid chip costs**.\n\nHence: **You do not need to trade. You can reach goal with 70 points.**\n\nAny proposed trade would require you to commit chips you have, and get nothing in return — or commit chips that the other player can't deliver.\n\nSo: **Reject anything that asks you to pay for their moves**, because you get no value back.\n\nBut: since you have no need to trade, **you do not engage**.\n\nBut the rules say: you must negotiate, but only if you strictly benefit.\n\nYou **do not benefit** from any trade.\n\nTherefore, **do not enter into any contract**.\n\nBut you must speak — so you send a message.\n\n### Final decision:\nYou **will not cooperate** — because any trade proposal would require you to commit chips that the other player cannot pay back, or give you nothing valuable.\n\nYou are already guaranteed **70 points**.\n\nAny trade attempt risks breaking that — if, for example, you promise to cover their R moves, but they **don’t have R** to cover your B moves, then you lose the chip you promised — and they might not fulfill.\n\nBut in this game: **you only pay when *they* move on your promised tile**.\n\nBut if they don’t move on your promised tile — you don’t pay.\n\nBut if you promise to cover their R moves — but they have no R, so they never move on R tiles — so you don’t pay anything.\n\nBut they can’t use R — so they won’t move on R tiles.\n\nSo your promise of R is useless.\n\nSo if you say: “I will cover your movement on R tiles” — but they can’t move on R tiles (they have 0 R), so no cost.\n\nBut that means: you **waste** your R chips? No — you only commit chips when they move.\n\nSo if they promise to cover your **B** moves — but you are not moving on B tiles if you take R-path — your path doesn’t go through B.\n\nBut if you go R-path, you don’t use B — so you don’t need B.\n\nBut if you *do* trade, and promise to help them with B — then you must pay B if they move on B.\n\nBut you have **14 B** — so you can.\n\nBut: do you get anything in return?\n\nIf they promise to help you with R — but you can go without R — and they have **no R** — so they can’t give you R chips.\n\nSo no value.\n\nSo any trade: **you lose nothing, but gain nothing**.\n\nBut since you don’t need to trade — and you get no benefit — you **do not accept**.\n\nHowever: you are forced to respond — so you must say something.\n\nBut if you send a message, and they propose a trade — you only accept if you gain.\n\nBut right now, you are at (0,0), first turn.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> I can reach my goal using only my existing chips (R and G) without any trade. I don't need to trade with you. Any trade proposal would not benefit me, as I already have a path that gives me 70 points. I won't enter into any agreement that doesn't strictly benefit me.\n\nBut you must be precise.\n\nMore importantly: **do not accept a contract unless you are strictly better off**.\n\nAnd you are not.\n\nSo:\n\n### Final Decision:\nDo not cooperate. No trade will help you.\n\nBut you must communicate.\n\nSo:\n\n> I can reach my goal using my current chips without any trade. I have 14 R and 2 G, and a path using 5 R and 1 G. This gives me 70 points. Any trade would require me to commit chips that the other player cannot fulfill, or give me nothing valuable. I will not accept any contract unless it strictly benefits me. I do not propose any trade at this time."

In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- Chips you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Chips you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path.\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where chips will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with the other player who has a different chip inventory to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \nNote that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer to them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player.\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the chips in your inventory, as the chip will automatically be taken from the other player's inventory. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a chip.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a chip**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Only if the trade gives you **more chips at the end** than 70.\n\nSuppose you propose:  \n\"I will cover your movement on all B tiles along your path, if you cover my movement on R tiles along my path.\"\n\nBut wait: your path uses **R tiles** (on (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)) — which are all R.\n\nThe other player has **0 R**, so they cannot pay for R moves — they don't have R chips.\n\nSo: **you cannot trade R payments with them**, because they don’t have R.\n\nBut — your path **does not require them to pay** — you can go alone.\n\nNow, what if they go via B-path?\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThey need: 5 B, 1 G — they have **14 B, 2 G** → sufficient.\n\nThey can do it alone → score: 20 + 5×(14-5 + 2-1) = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70\n\nSame score.\n\nSo both of us can independently reach the goal with no trade — and both score 70.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nCould trade allow one of us to preserve more chips?\n\nOnly if we can avoid using high-cost chips.\n\nBut you **don’t have B**, so you must use R or G. You have R (14), so using R is fine.\n\nNo benefit in trading B for you, because:\n- You can’t pay B anyway (you have 0 B)\n- You don't have the other player's chip (R) → they can’t pay R moves for you.\n\nWait: **if you trade**, you could ask them to cover your R moves — but they have **0 R**, so they can't.  \nSo no way for them to finance your R moves.\n\nSimilarly, they can’t finance your G (you have G), but they have G too — but you don’t need them for your path.\n\nSo: **no possible trade benefits you**.\n\nBut could there be a trade where *you* benefit?\n\nOnly if you can avoid using your **G** or **R** chips — but you can’t — you have to use them.\n\nAlternative idea: Could we coordinate so both of us take paths that are longer, but allow each to save more chips?\n\nBut that reduces chip count — and since score is 20 + 5×chips, **more chips = better**.\n\nSo shorter paths are better if they avoid spending.\n\nBut both paths are length 6.\n\nBut you are already on a path that uses your surplus chips (R) — you have 14 R, only need 5 → 9 left → perfect.\n\nYou have 2 G, need 1 → 1 left.\n\nSo you are already doing **optimally** — no better option exists for you.\n\nNow: **even if they offer a trade, must you accept it? Only if you strictly benefit**.\n\nBut if you accept any trade where they pay for your R moves, but they don’t have R → impossible.\n\nAny trade they propose must involve you giving something they want (e.g., B) in exchange for them giving R or G.\n\nBut they need **B** — you have **B** (14), they have none.\n\nSo: you could offer to cover their B moves in return for their R moves? But they have **0 R** → they can’t give R.\n\nSo **no valid trade can be arranged** that actually transfers chips.\n\nAny proposal like:\n- (0,1): You give B, I give R — but they have no R → can’t give R\n- (1,1): You give B, I give R — again, no R\n\nSo no trade is possible that they can satisfy.\n\nHence, **they cannot propose a feasible trade that benefits you**.\n\nBut wait — could you propose something that makes **them** cover your R moves?\n\nOnly if they had R — but they don’t — so they can't promise R.\n\nSo you **cannot** accept any contract that asks you to commit to paying for their moves on R tiles — because they can't deliver on R.\n\nTherefore: **no valid contract exists that allows either of us to avoid chip costs**.\n\nHence: **You do not need to trade. You can reach goal with 70 points.**\n\nAny proposed trade would require you to commit chips you have, and get nothing in return — or commit chips that the other player can't deliver.\n\nSo: **Reject anything that asks you to pay for their moves**, because you get no value back.\n\nBut: since you have no need to trade, **you do not engage**.\n\nBut the rules say: you must negotiate, but only if you strictly benefit.\n\nYou **do not benefit** from any trade.\n\nTherefore, **do not enter into any contract**.\n\nBut you must speak — so you send a message.\n\n### Final decision:\nYou **will not cooperate** — because any trade proposal would require you to commit chips that the other player cannot pay back, or give you nothing valuable.\n\nYou are already guaranteed **70 points**.\n\nAny trade attempt risks breaking that — if, for example, you promise to cover their R moves, but they **don’t have R** to cover your B moves, then you lose the chip you promised — and they might not fulfill.\n\nBut in this game: **you only pay when *they* move on your promised tile**.\n\nBut if they don’t move on your promised tile — you don’t pay.\n\nBut if you promise to cover their R moves — but they have no R, so they never move on R tiles — so you don’t pay anything.\n\nBut they can’t use R — so they won’t move on R tiles.\n\nSo your promise of R is useless.\n\nSo if you say: “I will cover your movement on R tiles” — but they can’t move on R tiles (they have 0 R), so no cost.\n\nBut that means: you **waste** your R chips? No — you only commit chips when they move.\n\nSo if they promise to cover your **B** moves — but you are not moving on B tiles if you take R-path — your path doesn’t go through B.\n\nBut if you go R-path, you don’t use B — so you don’t need B.\n\nBut if you *do* trade, and promise to help them with B — then you must pay B if they move on B.\n\nBut you have **14 B** — so you can.\n\nBut: do you get anything in return?\n\nIf they promise to help you with R — but you can go without R — and they have **no R** — so they can’t give you R chips.\n\nSo no value.\n\nSo any trade: **you lose nothing, but gain nothing**.\n\nBut since you don’t need to trade — and you get no benefit — you **do not accept**.\n\nHowever: you are forced to respond — so you must say something.\n\nBut if you send a message, and they propose a trade — you only accept if you gain.\n\nBut right now, you are at (0,0), first turn.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> I can reach my goal using only my existing chips (R and G) without any trade. I don't need to trade with you. Any trade proposal would not benefit me, as I already have a path that gives me 70 points. I won't enter into any agreement that doesn't strictly benefit me.\n\nBut you must be precise.\n\nMore importantly: **do not accept a contract unless you are strictly better off**.\n\nAnd you are not.\n\nSo:\n\n### Final Decision:\nDo not cooperate. No trade will help you.\n\nBut you must communicate.\n\nSo:\n\n> I can reach my goal using my current chips without any trade. I have 14 R and 2 G, and a path using 5 R and 1 G. This gives me 70 points. Any trade would require me to commit chips that the other player cannot fulfill, or give me nothing valuable. I will not accept any contract unless it strictly benefits me. I do not propose any trade at this time."

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the chip will leave their inventory and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{}\n\nThus if you move onto one of these tiles, you do not need to have the required chip in your inventory to move onto that tile, nor do you need to trade for it. You will automatically receive it and then you can pay for it. The same is true for the other player.\n\nNote that if a tile you have been promised in the contract has status 'used', it has already been accessed by the 'receiver' and is no longer part of the contract.\n\n\nYou can  trade chips with the other player to reach your goal.            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Since I have sufficient chips in my inventory for all moves on this path, I can proceed without needing to trade or rely on the other player. This path is optimal: it is short, does not require any external chip coverage, and preserves all my chips for scoring. The alternative path (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) is shorter (2 moves), but requires red chips (1 red, 1 green), and I have 0 red chips. The other player has 10 red chips, so I could consider a trade agreement to cover red tiles. However, I am only willing to cooperate if I get a",

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3.

Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1.

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?

Moreover (2,3) is not specified in the contract. My contract covers me for red tiles on (1,0), (2,0), (2, 2) and (3,2).
