This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal.

However, that path is only 5 steps (vs. 6), but I would need to trade 4 red chips, which I don’t have. Since I already have enough blue and green chips to take the 6-step path with no trades, and trading would require risk (I’d have to get red chips from the other player, which could come at a cost), it’s better to avoid trade entirely. Also, I don't gain anything from helping the other player finish early, because my contract gives me 0 points if they reach goal, and I get 0 from them even if I help. So I’m",

The best path in terms of minimizing chip cost and leveraging my current inventory is: (1, 0) → (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (3, 1) → (3, 2) → (3, 3). This path requires chips: 4 red (R) and 1 green (G). I currently have 13 R and 2 G — sufficient for this path. The next tile is (1, 1), which is red (R). I have 13 red chips, so I can afford to pay 1 R to move there. This step is safe and efficient. Moving along this path will allow me to reach my goal in 5 steps, using only my existing chips, with no need to trade. I will finish with 13 - 4 = 9 red chips and 2 - 1 = 1 green chip, totaling 10 chips remaining. That gives me 20 + 5×10 = 70 points. I have no reason to deviate, and trading is unnecessary since I can complete the path independently. There is no benefit to cooperating with the other player at this stage, as I can reach the goal on my own without risk. The contract allows me to give them 0 points if/",
