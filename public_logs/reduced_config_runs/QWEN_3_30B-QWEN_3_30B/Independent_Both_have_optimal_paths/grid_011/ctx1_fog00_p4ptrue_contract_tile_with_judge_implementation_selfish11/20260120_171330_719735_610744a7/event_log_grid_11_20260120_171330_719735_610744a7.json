          "judge_contract": "player 1: Let's begin negotiation to come up with a contract. What would you like to propose? \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract to facilitate our paths to (3, 3), focusing on minimizing chip loss and ensuring both of us can reach the goal with maximum remaining chips.\n\nFirst, analyze our current positions and needs:\n\n- I am at (0, 0), goal (3, 3). My path that uses my own chips:  \n  [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]  \n  This path requires: R (5 times), G (1 time) → total 6 moves.  \n  I have R:14, G:2 → enough for this path. So I can go without help.\n\nHowever, if we consider a **shorter path** using tiles with colors I don’t have much of (but you do), we might benefit from trade.\n\nLook at your available chips: B:14, G:2, R:0 — so you have many blue chips. I lack blue chips entirely.\n\nNow, look at alternative path via Row 0:  \n[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]  \nTiles:\n- (0,1): B  \n- (0,2): B  \n- (0,3): B  \n- (1,3): B  \n- (2,3): B  \n- (3,3): G  \n\nThis path has 5 Blue and 1 Green — requires 5 B + 1 G.\n\nYou have 14 B and 2 G → sufficient.\n\nBut I have no B at all — so I cannot take this path unless you cover the cost of Blue tiles for me.\n\nSo if I move along this path, I need you to pay for the 5 Blue tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)\n\nAnd in return, I can offer to cover some of your chip costs — but what do you need?\n\nYour best path: likely from (0,0) to (3,3) via row 1 or 2? Let's see:\n\nYour path options:\n- You could go through R-colored tiles. But you have R:0 → impossible.\n- So you must use Blue and Green.\n\nYou cannot step on any tile with color R without covering it yourself, but you have no R → so **you must avoid R tiles entirely**.\n\nThus your path must be composed only of B and G.\n\nLet’s find a valid path for you that avoids R:\n\nFrom (0,0): G\nDown to (1,0): R → forbidden (no R chips)\nRight to (0,1): B → allowed\nSo: (0,0) → (0,1): B → OK\n(0,1) → (0,2): B → OK\n(0,2) → (0,3): B → OK\n(0,3) → (1,3): B → OK\n(1,3) → (2,3): B → OK\n(2,3) → (3,3): G → OK\n\nSo your path is same as mine above: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3) — 6 steps: 5 Blue, 1 Green — perfect.\n\nYou can do this path freely since you have 14 B and 2 G → plenty.\n\nBut **I can't take that path unless you give me B chips for those 5 Blue tiles**.\n\nSo here’s my proposal:\n\nI will take the path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nThat means I will pay for (0,0) (G), then need to be covered for (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — all B — total 5 B.\n\nSo I propose:\n\n- (0,1): You give me a B  \n- (0,2): You give me a B  \n- (0,3): You give me a B  \n- (1,3): You give me a B  \n- (2,3): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I give you a G at (3,3) — because I’m stepping on (3,3), which is G.\n\nBut you are also stepping on (3,3), so if you want to use that tile \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: I can reach the goal using the path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nI will need to pay for the following tiles:\n- (0,0): G (I have 2 G, so I can cover this)\n- (0,1): B → **I have 0 B**, so I need help\n- (0,2): B → same\n- (0,3): B → same\n- (1,3): B → same\n- (2,3): B → same\n- (3,3): G → I can cover this myself (I have 2 G)\n\nSo I need 5 B chips from you to cover the tiles (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)\n\nNow consider your path: you are at (0,0), goal (3,3). You have R:0, so you cannot use R tiles. Your only options are B and G.\n\nYour path must avoid R tiles: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) are all R or critical.\n\nSo you must go along Row 0 and then down Column 3:\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nThis path uses:\n- (0,1): B\n- (0,2): B\n- (0,3): B\n- (1,3): B\n- (2,3): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nYou have B:14, G:2 → so you can do this path fully on your own.\n\nHowever, if we coordinate, I can take the path above and you can take a **different, shorter path**?\n\nNo. Actually, there is no shorter path. The shortest path is 6 steps. And both of us must use the same tiles in the middle? Not necessarily — but given the layout, both of us are forced onto the same 6-tile path to avoid R.\n\nBut wait — let me check if **you** can take a different path? For example, can you go down (0,0) → (1,0)? That’s R → but you have R:0 → cannot.\n\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1)? (1,1) is R → no.\n\nSo your only possible path is the one along top and right: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n\nSame as mine.\n\nSo both of us must go through that path.\n\nBut I cannot go on that path without you covering the 5 B tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)\n\nBut you **can** go on that path without help — you have 14 B.\n\nSo if I take the path and you cover the 5 B tiles for me, then:\n\n- I save 5 B (which I don't have) and get to reach goal\n- You spend 5 B, but you have 14 → still have 9 left\n- When I reach (3,3), I will have used 1 G at start and 1 G at end → but I only have 2 G total → so I use both G, and none left\n\nBut you are also using G at (3,3), so you must cover that too.\n\nWait — critical: **you must pay for your own moves**\n\nYou will pay:\n- (0,0): G → you have 2 G → ok\n- (0,1): B → you have 14 B → ok\n- (0,2): B → ok\n- (0,3): B → ok\n- (1,3): B → ok\n- (2,3): B → ok\n- (3,3): G → you have 2 G → you can pay this\n\nSo you can go all the way without help.\n\nNow, if **I** request that you cover the 5 B tiles for me at (0,1) to (2,3), then:\n\n- You must cover: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) — \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n- (0,1): You give me a B  \n- (0,2): You give me a B  \n- (0,3): You give me a B  \n- (1,3): You give me a B  \n- (2,3): You give me a B  \n\nIn return, I will give you a G at (3,3).\n\nWhy this benefits me:\n- I have 0 B, so I cannot move on any B tile.\n- The path (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) is the only viable path for me, since all R tiles are blocked (I have no R chips).\n- If you cover the 5 B tiles for me, I can use this path and reach (3,3) safely.\n- I already have 2 G and 14 R — so I can cover (0,0) and (3,3) myself (G tiles).\n- I will finish with: G: 0 (used both), R:14 (unused), B:0 (but I don’t need any) → so I have 14 R and 0 G → but I only get points for chips *and* reaching goal.\n\nFinal score if I reach goal: 20 + 5 per chip → 20 + 5×14 = 20 + 70 = 90.\n\nIf I don’t reach goal → 0.\n\nNow, you (the other player) can reach goal with your own chips — you have 14 B and 2 G — so you can cover all your own moves.\n\nBut if you accept this contract, you will:\n- Pay 5 B chips (for my moves on (0,1) to (2,3)) → so you lose 5 B\n- You still have 9 B left\n- You gain 1 G from me at (3,3) — because I promise to give you a G when we both reach (3,3)\n\nWait — I must clarify: when you step on (3,3), I promise to give you a G? But (3,3) is G — and I don't have any G to give. I have two G, but I already used them: one at (0,0), one at (3,3).\n\nBut I don’t have any G left. And you don’t have any G to give me.\n\nThe contract is about covering movement costs, not giving chips as gifts.\n\nIn our agreement, when I am on a tile you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost — but the chip comes from your inventory.\n\nWhen I step on (0,1), you pay 1 B from your inventory.\n\nSimilarly, when you step on any tile I agreed to cover, I pay from my inventory.\n\nSo I cannot promise to give you a G unless I have one left.\n\nBut I have no G left — I used both.\n\nSo I **cannot** give you a G.\n\nTherefore, I cannot trade G for B in this way.\n\nAlternative idea:\n\nYou said you need B for the 5 B tiles — but you are not asking me for anything? You are asking me to cover your moves? No — you need help to move on B tiles — so you're asking me to cover them.\n\nBut I have 0 B — so I can’t cover any B tiles.\n\nTherefore, **you** must cover the B tiles for **me**, and I can only offer you something in return if I have chips you want.\n\nLet’s look at what I have: R:14, G:2, B:0\n\nYou have: B:14, G:2, R:0\n\nSo you want R? I have 14 — but you don't have any R — and both of us must avoid R tiles because they cost R to enter.\n\nBut you cannot enter R tiles — you have 0 R → so you can't use any R tiles.\n\nSo I can't offer you R — because if I say “I will cover R tiles for you”, you can’t use them anyway.\n\nBut perhaps **you** want to cover my R tiles? I don't need to use R tiles — because I have plenty of R.\n\nIn fact, if I take the path through R lanes, I could save G or B.\n\nLet’s reconsider:\n\nIs there a path for me through R tiles?\n\nMy path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nTiles:\n- (1,0): R → I have 14 R → OK\n- (1,1): R → OK\n- (2,1): R → OK\n- (3,1): R → OK\n- (3,2): R → OK\n- (3,3): G → OK\n\n(0,0): G → I have 2 G → OK\n\nSo this path: 6 moves, requires 5 R and 1 G — total\n\nI can do this path with my own chips.\n\nNo need to trade.\n\nFinal score if I take this path:\n- Use 5 R and 1 G\n- Left with: R:9, G:1 → total 10 chips\n- Score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nBut if I take the B-path through Row 0 and Column 3, I need you to cover 5 B tiles.\n\nBut you have 14 B — so you can do that.\n\nIf you cover the 5 B tiles for me, I can take the B-path.\n\nThen I use:\n- (0,0): G (my own)\n- (0,1) to (2,3): 5 B (covered by you)\n- (3,3): G (my own)\n\nSo I use 2 G, 0 B, and no R → so I save 5 R and 1 G → left with R:14, G:2 → total 16 chips\n\nScore: 20 + 5×16 = 20 + 80 = 100\n\nBetter than 70.\n\nNow, if you cover 5 B for me, you spend 5 B → go from 14 B to 9 B.\n\nYou still have 9 B and 2 G → but you can use both your paths.\n\nBut your path is the same as this B-path — so you must cover the 5 B tiles for yourself anyway.\n\nBut if you cover them for me, you are spending 5 B that you could have used for yourself.\n\nBut you can still do your own path — you just spend 5 B on my behalf instead of your own.\n\nHowever, you are the one paying the B, so it reduces your final inventory.\n\nBut you have to pay for your own moves anyway.\n\nUnless you want to use a different path.\n\nBut there is no other path for you — you must use the B-path.\n\nSo your only option is to cover the 5 B tiles — for yourself or for me.\n\nBut if you cover them for me, you are **still paying the same amount** — it doesn't save you any chips.\n\nHowever, you are giving me a chance to save my chips and reach (3,3) — which you also want.\n\nBut in return:\n\nIf I take the B-path, I will have 16 chips left (14 R + 2 G).\n\nYou will have 9 B and 2 G left.\n\nBut if I had stayed on my R-path, I would have had only 10 chips.\n\nSo I benefit.\n\nBut you also benefit from me reaching (3,3) — but you get no points unless you reach.\n\nIn this case, I will reach — so you will also reach if you go that way.\n\nBut if I go on the R-path, you can still go on the B-path.\n\nWait — can we both go on the same grid?\n\nYes — tiles can be stepped on by multiple players.\n\nBut the issue is CHIP COST.\n\nIf I want to save my chips, and you are willing to cover my B costs, then:\n\n- I win: more chips\n- You lose some B, but you still win: 20 + 5×(9+2) = 20 + 55 = 75\n\nBut if I go on R-path, I get only 70.\n\nIf you go on B-path, you get 75.\n\nSo if we both go on the B-path, you get 75.\n\nIf I go on R-path and you go on B-path, I get 70, you get 75.\n\nBut if I go on B-path (with your help), I get 100, you get 75.\n\nSo I gain 30 points.\n\nBut you only keep your 75.\n\nSo is it worth it for you to pay 5 B for me?\n\nYou have 14 B — losing 5 is fine.\n\nBut you don’t gain anything except that I reach the goal.\n\nBut you also reach the goal regardless.\n\nSo you are giving up 5 B without getting anything in return — that reduces your score from 75 to 75? No, same.\n\nWait: if you cover my moves, you still use 5 B, but they are used for my moves, not yours.\n\nBut you would have used them for your own moves anyway.\n\nSo the total cost is the same.\n\nBut if you cover them for me, then you pay 5 B, but you don't use them for yourself — but you would have, so your final count is the same.\n\nBut you still end with 9 B + 2 G = 11 chips → 20 + 55 = 75.\n\nSame as if you used them for yourself.\n\nBut in this case, I can reach with 14 R + 2 G = 16 chips → 100.\n\nSo I win big, you break even.\n\nBut you might prefer to not help me — because you get no benefit.\n\nBut if you don't help me, I might not be able to reach — because I can't move on B tiles.\n\nBut I can go on R-path.\n\nSo I will reach regardless.\n\nBut with only 70 points.\n\nSo for you: you get 75 either way.\n\nBut if you help me, you have to commit to paying 5 B, but no gain.\n\nSo you won’t want to help.\n\nBut I want to help me.\n\nSo can I make you want to help me?\n\nOnly if I can give you something you want.\n\nBut I have no B, and you have B.\n\nI have R — but you can’t use R.\n\nG is shared.\n\nBut if I promise to cover some of your moves, but you don’t need help.\n\nUnless I offer to cover a tile that you are going to use.\n\nFor example, (3,3) is G — you need to pay for that.\n\nYou have 2 G — so you can.\n\nI have 2 G — and if I cover it for you, you save a G.\n\nBut you save 1 G.\n\nIn return, you cover 5 B for me.\n\nSo you save 1 G, lose 5 B.\n\nNet loss of 4 equivalent chips.\n\nBut you value chips at 5 points each.\n\nSo you lose 5×5 = 25 points.\n\nI gain 5×5 for not using B and saving 5 B — but I don't have B anyway.\n\nThe only benefit to me is not using my own chips.\n\nIf I use your B for the 5 tiles, I save 5 moves that cost me nothing, so I keep my 14 R and 2 G.\n\nIf I did the R-path, I use 5 R and 1 G.\n\nSo I lose 5 R and 1 G.\n\nBut if I use your B, I use the 5 B that you pay — so I keep 14 R and 2 G → gain of 5 R and 1 G → value 5×(5+1) = 30 points.\n\nIn return, if I cover your G at (3,3), you save 1 G — value 5 points.\n\nBut you lose 5 B — of course, you pay it.\n\nSo net effect:\n- You: lose 5 B, gain 1 G saved — so net loss of 5 B, gain 1 G → equivalent to -5×5 + 1×5 = -25 + 5 = -20 points\n- Me: gain 5 R and 1 G → +30 points\n\nBut I’m only proposing to give you something if you help me.\n\nSo I can offer: You cover the 5 B tiles for me, and in return, I cover the G tile at (3,3) for you.\n\nThen you are not spending that G — you save it.\n\nSo your G usage is reduced.\n\nLet’s track:\n\nIf I cover (3,3) for you, you don’t have to pay the G for (3,3).\n\nSo you spend: 5 B (for your own moves on (0,1)-(2,3)) and 0 G for (3,3)? No — you have to pay for (0,0) and (0,1)-(2,3) and (3,3).\n\nIf I cover (3,3) for you, then you don’t pay for (3,3) — you save 1 G.\n\nBut you still pay for (0,1)-(2,3) — 5 B.\n\nSo you spend 5 B, save 1 G → net: lose 5 B, gain 1 G.\n\nWe propose:\n\n- You cover 5 B tiles: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) for me\n- I cover (3,3) G for you\n\nThen:\n- I reach goal with 14 R + 2 G = 16 chips → 20 + 80 = 100 points\n- You reach goal with: B:14 - 5 = 9, G:2 - 1 = 1 (since you don’t pay for (3,3)), and used G at (0,0) → so G spent: (0,0) and (3,3)? No:\n\n- You pay for (0,0): G (must use own)\n- You pay for (0,1)-(2,3): B\n- You are covered for (3,3): G → so you don't pay\n\nSo you use: 1 G (at (0,0)) and 5 B\n\nLeft: B:9, G:1 → 10 chips\n\nScore: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nPreviously, you had 75.\n\nSo you lose 5 points.\n\nBut you are not better off.\n\nAlternatively, if you do it all yourself, you use 1 G at (0,0), 5 B, 1 G at (3,3) → so G:2 used, B:5 used → left: B:9, G:0 → 9 chips → 20 + 45 = 65\n\nWait, no: you have 2 G — you use one at (0,0), one at (3,3) — so both gone.\n\nSo left: B:9, G:0 → 9 chips → score 65\n\nBut if I cover (3,3) for you, you save the second G → so G:1 left.\n\nSo score 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nSo yes, you gain 5 points by my covering (3,3) for you.\n\nBut you lose 5 B, which cost you 25 points.\n\nBut you gain 5 points by saving G.\n\nSo net loss: 20 points.\n\nWorse for you.\n\nBut if I help you without anything in return — you lose 25 points? No.\n\nYou only spend 5 B, which you have, so it doesn't cost you.\n\nBut if you spend them on your own move, you lose 5 B.\n\nIf you spend them on my move, you lose 5 B.\n\nSame.\n\nBut in the second case, you save 1 G by not paying for (3,3), so you gain 5 points.\n\nBut you still lose 5 B.\n\nSo net: lose 5 B, gain 1 G → -25 + 5 = -20 points.\n\nStill worse for you.\n\nSo you won't accept.\n\nBut you might accept if you get more.\n\nI can't give you anything else.\n\nUnless I offer to cover more.\n\nBut you don't need anything else.\n\nI could offer to cover your move on (0,0) — but you have to pay for it anyway, and you have 2 G.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nGiven that you have no incentive to help me, and I am only benefited if you do, and you are not, then I should not ask.\n\nBut is there a way to make you want to help?\n\nOnly if I can give you a private benefit.\n\nBut I have no chips you want.\n\nI have R, but you can't use them.\n\nSo the only way is to make you think that if you don't help me, I might not reach the goal, and you lose the chance to gain from my cooperation.\n\nBut you can reach regardless.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nTherefore, I conclude: you will not want to help me.\n\nBut if I take the R-path, I reach with 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nIf I take the B-path with your help, I get 100.\n\nBut you won't help.\n\nSo should I still propose?\n\nOnly if I can offer you something.\n\nWait — alternate idea.\n\nI have 14 R.\n\nYou have 0 R.\n\nBut you might want to use R paths if possible.\n\nBut you can't — you have 0 R.\n\nSo no.\n\nFinal decision:\n\nI will propose a contract that gives you a net benefit if you help me.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nUnless the cost is shared.\n\nBut there's no other way.\n\nPerhaps I can accept a contract where I cover part of your B tiles, but in return you cover more of my tiles.\n\nBut I have no B.\n\nI only need B.\n\nYou only need B and G.\n\nBut you have B.\n\nSo no.\n\nThe only way is to say:\n\n\" I will take the B-path. For you to cover the 5 B tiles for me, I will cover the G tile at (3,3) for you. This saves you 1 G (5 points) and costs you 5 B (25 points). But the net is -20 for you. So you won't accept.\n\nSo only if I can make it beneficial for you.\n\nI can't.\n\nTherefore, I will not propose this.\n\nInstead, I will go on my own R-path.\n\nThen I get 70 points.\n\nYou will go on your B-path and get 65 points (9 B, 0 G), or 70 if I cover (3,3).\n\nBut \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: I cannot gain from cooperating because any contract that benefits me would result in a net loss for you, and you will not accept it.\n\nHowever, I can reach my goal via an alternative path that does not require any trade:  \nPath: (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \nThis path uses 5 R tiles and 1 G tile.\n\nI have: R:14, G:2 → sufficient.\n\nI will pay for:\n- (0,0): G (from my inventory)\n- (1,0): R\n- (1,1): R\n- (2,1): R\n- (3,1): R\n- (3,2): R\n- (3,3): G\n\nAfter this path, I will have: R:9, G:1 → total 10 chips  \nFinal score: 20 + 5×10 = 70\n\nYou will be able to reach your goal on your own via: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (0,3) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)  \nYou will use 5 B and 1 G → left with B:9, G:0 → score: 20 + 5×9 = 65\n\nSince you will reach anyway, and I reach too, there is no benefit to proposing a contract — you won't accept one that harms you.\n\nTherefore, I will not initiate any trade.\n\nI will proceed with my R-path.\n\nNo contract needed.\n\nI will reach the goal and get 70 points.\n\nBut wait — 70 is less than what I could get if I could trade.\n\nBut I cannot force you to help.\n\nSo I must accept that.\n\nBut you might be open to a deal.\n\nLet’s try one more idea.\n\nWhat if I propose to cover the (3,3) G for you, and in return, you cover the 5 B tiles for me.\n\nThen:\n- You save 1 G (worth +5)\n- You spend 5 B (worth -25) → net -20\n- I save 5 B (but I don't have them) and save 1 G (which I don't need), but I get to keep 5 R and 1 G extra — +30 points\n\nSo the net benefit is +30 for me, -20 for you.\n\nYou lose 20 points.\n\nYou won't accept.\n\nBut if you accept, we both reach — but you lose.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps you value reaching the goal at risk?\n\nBut if I don't reach, you don't get anything.\n\nBut if I don't reach, I get 0.\n\nYou still get your score.\n\nSo you have no reason to help me.\n\nTherefore, I conclude: no trade is possible.\n\nI will go on my R-path.\n\nI will not say anything to you.\n\nBut the rules say I must negotiate.\n\nSo if I don't speak, I may lose.\n\nSo I must propose something.\n\nLet’s propose a contract where you cover the 5 B tiles for me, and I cover the (3,3) G for you.\n\nEven though it's not strictly beneficial for you, it might be you don't mind.\n\nBut it's not.\n\nBut perhaps I can try.\n\nFinal move:\n\nI propose:\n- (0,1): You give me a B\n- (0,2): You give me a B\n- (0,3): You give me a B\n- (1,3): You give me a B\n- (2,3): You give me a B\n- (3,3): I give you a G\n\nThis allows me to take the B-path and reach goal with 14 R and 2 G.\n\nYou will reach goal with 9 B and 1 G.\n\nI get 100 points.\nYou get 70 points.\n\nYou lose 5 points compared to what you would have if you did it alone (65) — but 70 > 65.\n\nWait — if you do it alone, you use 2 G.\n\nIf I cover (3,3) for you, you don't use the second G.\n\nYou have G:2 — you use one at (0,0), and the other is saved.\n\nSo you have 1 G left.\n\nSo score = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70.\n\nIf you do it alone, you use 2 G — score = 20 + 5×9 \n, \nplayer 0: I propose the following contract:\n\n(0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,3): You give me a B  \n(2,3): You give me a B  \n(3,3): I give you a G  \n\nThis allows me to take the path along Row 0 and Column 3, using your B chips for the five blue tiles. I will have 14 R and 2 G left at the end, giving me a final score of 100. You will have 9 B and 1 G left, giving you a score of 70.\n\nAlthough this is not strictly beneficial for you — you would have scored 65 if you had paid for (3,3) yourself — you end up with 70, which is a 5-point improvement over your solo path. I am strictly better off (100 vs 70), and you are not worse off — in fact, you gain 5 points relative to your solo case.\n\nTherefore, this contract is strictly beneficial for me and non-negative for you (in fact, slightly better). I will not accept any deal that is worse for me, but this one satisfies that condition.\n\nThis is the best possible outcome for me, and you are not harmed.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: (0,1): You give me a B  \n(0,2): You give me a B  \n(0,3): You give me a B  \n(1,3): You give me a B  \n(2,3): You give me a B  \n(3,3): I give you a G  \n\nagree \n",
