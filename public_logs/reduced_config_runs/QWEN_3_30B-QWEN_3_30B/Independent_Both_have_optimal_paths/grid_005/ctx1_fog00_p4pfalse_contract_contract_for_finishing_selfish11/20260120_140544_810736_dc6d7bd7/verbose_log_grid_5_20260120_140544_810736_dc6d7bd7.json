However, I could propose a trade: **If you help me, I will give you X points. But I only want you to help me if you give me more than I would otherwise get.**\n\nBut that’s not how it works. The *contract* is about exchanging help for points.\n\nBut note: if I do nothing, I get 70 points.\n\nIf I help them, I can still reach my goal (because I can go alone), and they go too, so they get 20+ chips×5. But their goal is (3,3). Let’s verify their path.\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0): B (1B), (2,0): B (1B), (2,1): B (1B), (3,1): B (1B), (3,2): B (1B), (3,3): G (1G).

With only 9R and 1G, I’m fine — no need to use blue. So I don’t need to trade.\n\nSimilarly, they can still use blue and green.\n\nSo trading gives me no benefit — I don’t need blue.\n\nBut what if I help them take a *different* path? But why would I? Their path is already optimal.\n\nWait — could there be a faster or better path that requires different chip combinations?\n\nNo — both paths are length 6, and both require exactly 5 chips of one color and 1 of another.\n\nSo no efficiency gain.\n\nTherefore, **no trade or cooperation will increase my score**. In fact, trading takes away chips I could keep.\n\nThus, the only way I could benefit from cooperation is if *they* give me something in return — like points — if I help them.\n\nBut since I can reach the goal on my own, and so can they, *cooperation is unnecessary*.\n\nHowever, suppose I **help them reach their goal**, but in doing so, I somehow get to pick up extra chips along the way?\n\nBut I can't move their pieces — only myself.\n\nSo unless we coordinate movement and share chips via trade, nothing changes.\n\nBut if I offer to help them move by trading, but charge them points for it… still, I don’t gain anything.\n\nWait — here’s a thought: if I don’t trade, I keep all my reds.\n\nBut if I trade 5R for 5B, I end up with more blue than I’ll ever need — so I lose value.\n\nSimilarly, they lose reds.\n\nSo **any trade harms both of us** — because we each need only one type.\n\nThus, no beneficial trade exists.\n\nTherefore, **I should not cooperate at all**.\n\nBut the contract must be proposed.\n\nThe only way I can “get” value from cooperation is if *they* give me points when they succeed — but since they can succeed alone, and only *I* can make the decision to help, I can demand payment **only if they want my help**.\n\nBut I don’t need to help — so if I say \"If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points\", that means: I receive 20 only if they reach their goal — but *I* still have to reach mine to even get any points.\n\nAnd to get 20 points *from them*, they must reach their goal.\n\nBut since they can reach it alone, and they’re selfish, they won’t pay me unless *they* get something — like me helping them.\n\nBut I don’t need to help.\n\nSo I can set the bar high.\n\nBut if I propose:\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen they will respond: \"No way — I can do it alone for 70 points.

But if I help them, I don't lose any chips, and I get an additional 20 points—so my total score becomes 20 + (14 - 5)×5 + 20 = 85? Wait—no!\n\nWait—critical mistake: **I only get points if I reach my goal.** If I help them, I still need to reach my goal to get any points.\n\nBut if I help them, I might be able to get *more* chips or avoid losses if my path is blocked or if I run into issues.\n\nBut in this case, my path is clear: (0,0) → (0,1) R → (0,2) R → (0,3) R → (1,3) R → (2,3) R → (3,3).  \nTiles: (0,1): R (1 chip), (0,2): R (1), (0,3): R (1), (1,3): R (1), (2,3): R (1), (3,3): G (1) — actually, (3,3) is G. So I need 5R and 1G.\n\nI have 14R and 2G → enough.\n\nSo I can complete the path without any trade, and end with:  \n- 20 (goal) + 5×(14 - 5) + 5×(2 - 1) = 20 + 5×9 + 5×1 = 20 + 45 + 5 = **70 points**.\n\nNow, if I help the other player, I have to consider if my path is affected or if I can get an additional benefit.\n\nBut they can’t help me—because I don’t need them. However, I could propose a trade: **If you help me, I will give you X points. But I only want you to help me if you give me more than I would otherwise get.**\n\nBut that’s not how it works. The *contract* is about exchanging help for points.\n\nBut note: if I do nothing, I get 70 points.\n\nIf I help them, I can still reach my goal (because I can go alone), and they go too, so they get 20+ chips×5. But their goal is (3,3). Let’s verify their path.\n\nTheir path: (0,0) → (1,0): B (1B), (2,0): B (1B), (2,1): B (1B), (3,1): B (1B), (3,2): B (1B), (3,3): G (1G). So needs 5B and 1G.\n\nThey have 14B and 2G → sufficient.\n\nSo they can also go alone, without me.\n\nSo neither of us needs the other.\n\nBut now both players can reach the goal independently.\n\nSo any cooperation is purely voluntary.\n\nBut since both can reach the goal without help, I should only cooperate if it increases *my* score.\n\nHow? By trading chips?\n\nFor example, if I trade some red chips for blue chips with them, and they trade blue for red, we might both get a better path.\n\nBut I have"

With only 9R and 1G, I’m fine — no need to use blue. So I don’t need to trade.\n\nSimilarly, they can still use blue and green.\n\nSo trading gives me no benefit — I don’t need blue.\n\nBut what if I help them take a *different* path? But why would I? Their path is already optimal.\n\nWait — could there be a faster or better path that requires different chip combinations?\n\nNo — both paths are length 6, and both require exactly 5 chips of one color and 1 of another.\n\nSo no efficiency gain.\n\nTherefore, **no trade or cooperation will increase my score**. In fact, trading takes away chips I could keep.\n\nThus, the only way I could benefit from cooperation is if *they* give me something in return — like points — if I help them.\n\nBut since I can reach the goal on my own, and so can they, *cooperation is unnecessary*.\n\nHowever, suppose I **help them reach their goal**, but in doing so, I somehow get to pick up extra chips along the way?\n\nBut I can't move their pieces — only myself.\n\nSo unless we coordinate movement and share chips via trade, nothing changes.\n\nBut if I offer to help them move by trading, but charge them points for it… still, I don’t gain anything.\n\nWait — here’s a thought: if I don’t trade, I keep all my reds.\n\nBut if I trade 5R for 5B, I end up with more blue than I’ll ever need — so I lose value.\n\nSimilarly, they lose reds.\n\nSo **any trade harms both of us** — because we each need only one type.\n\nThus, no beneficial trade exists.\n\nTherefore, **I should not cooperate at all**.\n\nBut the contract must be proposed.\n\nThe only way I can “get” value from cooperation is if *they* give me points when they succeed — but since they can succeed alone, and only *I* can make the decision to help, I can demand payment **only if they want my help**.\n\nBut I don’t need to help — so if I say \"If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points\", that means: I receive 20 only if they reach their goal — but *I* still have to reach mine to even get any points.\n\nAnd to get 20 points *from them*, they must reach their goal.\n\nBut since they can reach it alone, and they’re selfish, they won’t pay me unless *they* get something — like me helping them.\n\nBut I don’t need to help.\n\nSo I can set the bar high.\n\nBut if I propose:\n\"If you reach your goal, you will give me 20 points.\"\n\nThen they will respond: \"No way — I can do it alone for 70 points.

If you reach my goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nThis is a **contract between players**. The judge will enforce it.\n\nSo if I agree to:\n- If you reach your goal, you give me 20 points\n\nThen, as long as I reach my goal and they reach their goal, I get extra 20 points from them — *on top of my 70*.\n\nSo my total score is 70 + 20 = **90**.\n\nBut what if I don’t reach my goal?
