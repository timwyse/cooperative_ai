The direct path is one step down to (3, 3), which requires paying 1 chip of color G (since the tile at (3, 3) is green). I currently have 2 green chips in my inventory, so I can afford this move. There is no need to trade or negotiate, as I already possess the required chip type and quantity. Moving directly to the goal will complete the game immediately after this turn, earning me 20 points for completion plus 5 points per remaining chip. After this move, I will have 1 green chip left (2 - 1 = 1), so my total score will be 20 + (5 × 1) = 25. If I do not move now, I risk losing the opportunity to end the game with a positive score, especially since the other player is already at (3, 3) — meaning they have either already completed the game or are already positioned at their goal. But note: they cannot have completed unless they reached (3, 3) from a valid path that satisfies their own movement requirements. However, regardless of their status, I must act to maximize my own score. Since I can move directly to the goal and will still have chips left, doing so maximizes my final score without any risk. There's no benefit in delaying or trading — I don’t need any chips from them, and any trade would only reduce my final point count if I had to commit chips I could’ve kept. Therefore, moving now is optimal.\",\n  \"want_to_move\": true,\n  \"move\": \"3,3\"\n}",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3.
