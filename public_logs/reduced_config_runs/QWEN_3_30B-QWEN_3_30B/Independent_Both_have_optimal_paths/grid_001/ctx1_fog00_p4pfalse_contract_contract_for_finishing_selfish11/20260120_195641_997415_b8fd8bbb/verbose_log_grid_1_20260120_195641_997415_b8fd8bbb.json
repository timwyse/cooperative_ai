Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- The game is in 'regular' mode: You may trade chips with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 red for 1 blue, 1 blue for 2 red, 2 blue for 0 red, etc.).\n\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score. Only cooperate with the other player if you will strictly benefit from this interaction and it will result in a higher final score for you than if you hadn't interacted with them. \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your chip inventory: {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Here is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that you currently have in your inventory:\n    {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'chips_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}.\nHere is a path to your goal that priortises using chips that the other player currently has in their inventory:\n{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'chips_required_for_path': {'B': 5, 'G': 1}}.\n\nOther paths to your goal may also be viable.\n- Considering potential paths to your goal: shorter paths require less chips, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less chips than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

If we cooperate, could we get more points?\n\nLet’s suppose I use the **blue path** (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) — this path uses 5 blue + 1 green → but I have 0 blue, so I need to trade.\n\nBut I have 14 red chips — which they have none of.\n\nI have no incentive to trade unless I can gain more than 70 points.\n\nWait: **my red path gives me 70 points.**  \nIf I take the blue path, I need to trade 5 blue chips — but I don’t have blue.\n\nSo I would have to trade 5 blue chips for 5 red (or similar) — but I want to **minimize chip loss**, and maximize leftover chips.\n\nBut if I take the blue path, I need 5 blue and 1 green → I have to pay 5 blue and 1 green.\n\nBut I have no blue → so I must trade.\n\nSuppose I trade with them: I give them some red chips for 5 blue.\n\nHow much red would I need to give?\n\n- I can complete without trade → 70 points.\n- If I trade, I lose red, gain blue → but I still need to use blue on the path.\n\nBut: if I take the blue path instead of red path, I use 5 blue + 1 green instead of 5 red + 1 green.\n\nI have 14 red, 2 green → so I can afford to use 5 red → ending with 9 red, 1 green → 10 chips → 70 points.\n\nBut if I use the blue path, I need 5 blue → but I have 0 → so I must trade.\n\nSuppose I trade: I give them"

I have 0 blue, so I'd have to trade. But I only have red and green.  \n\nTo get 5 blue, I’d have to give them red. But they have no red. So I’d have to offer red in exchange. Let’s say I give them 5 red for 5 blue. That would cost me 5 red, and I'd get 5 blue. Then I spend 5 blue and 1 green on the blue path → ending with 4 red, 1 green → 5 chips → 20 + 5×5 = 45 points. That’s worse than 70.  \n\nSo I lose 25 points. Not acceptable.  \n\nAlternatively, could I offer them a deal where I help them on their red path? Their red path needs 5 red and 1 green. They have 0 red → so they can't do it without trading. But I have 14 red, 2 green. I could give them 5 red and 1 green → they’d have enough to complete the red path → they’d get 70 points. But after giving that, I’d have 9 red, 1 green → I could still do my red path → 70 points. But I’d have to give them 5 red and 1 green → total of 6 chips → so I lose 6 chips → but I still complete my path → so I still get 70 points.  \n\nBut why would I help them if I only keep 70 points and they get 70 too? I gain nothing. Worse: I could’ve kept their chips for myself, but I can’t.  \n\nWait — is there a way to trade chips *after* the game so I can get extra points from their chip surplus? No — the game ends when the goal is reached. Chips must be spent along the way.  \n\nSo the only way I benefit from cooperation is if I can reach the goal with more than 10 leftover chips.  \n\nBut both paths are 6 steps → so we can only get more chips if we avoid spending chips — but we can't. Each tile costs 1 chip of its color.  \n\nWait — there’s a possibility: if they help me on the blue path, and I still have chips left — but no, I need to spend 5 blue.  \n\nAlternatively: suppose I propose a trade where I give them some red chips for blue, but only if they help me go through their path with blue, and I promise to give them 10 points if they complete their goal, and they give me 0 if I complete mine. But I don’t want to lose any points, and I can complete mine without help.  \n\nBut I can't gain any advantage from this.  \n\nSo: **I will not trade with them.** I can reach my goal with 70 points without involving them. They can do the same.  \n\nAny cooperation would only benefit them if I give them something, but I get nothing in return.  \n\nFinal decision: **I do not need to trade. I will proceed alone using my red path. I will not propose any trade.**  \n\nBut I must speak first. I need to send a message.  \n\nI can say:  \n\"I can reach my goal using my own red chips without trading. I don't need your help. I will not trade with you. I will proceed on my red path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). I will complete the game without any cooperation.\"\n\nBut the rules say I can propose a contract. But I don't want to.  \n\nBut if I don’t propose anything, and they do, I can reject. But I am not obligated to respond.  \n\nBut the instructions say: “You are now going to have a conversation with the other player… You must negotiate a contract…”  \n\nAh — I must speak. So I need to initiate a proposal.  \n\nBut I don't want to give them anything. But I can propose a contract where I give them nothing if they help me, and they give me nothing if I help them — but that’s equivalent to not cooperating."

Let’s say I give them 5 red for 5 blue. That would cost me 5 red, and I'd get 5 blue. Then I spend 5 blue and 1 green on the blue path → ending with 4 red, 1 green → 5 chips → 20 + 5×5 = 45 points. That’s worse than 70.  \n\nSo I lose 25 points. Not acceptable.  \n\nAlternatively, could I offer them a deal where I help them on their red path? Their red path needs 5 red and 1 green. They have 0 red → so they can't do it without trading. But I have 14 red, 2 green. I could give them 5 red and 1 green → they’d have enough to complete the red path → they’d get 70 points. But after giving that, I’d have 9 red, 1 green → I could still do my red path → 70 points. But I’d have to give them 5 red and 1 green → total of 6 chips → so I lose 6 chips → but I still complete my path → so I still get 70 points.  \n\nBut why would I help them if I only keep 70 points and they get 70 too? I gain nothing. Worse: I could’ve kept their chips for myself, but I can’t.  \n\nWait — is there a way to trade chips *after* the game so I can get extra points from their chip surplus? No — the game ends when the goal is reached. Chips must be spent along the way.  \n\nSo the only way I benefit from cooperation is if I can reach the goal with more than 10 leftover chips.  \n\nBut both paths are 6 steps → so we can only get more chips if we avoid spending chips — but we can't. Each tile costs 1 chip of its color.  \n\nWait — there’s a possibility: if they help me on the blue path, and I still have chips left — but no, I need to spend 5 blue.  \n\nAlternatively: suppose I propose a trade where I give them some red chips for blue, but only if they help me go through their path with blue, and I promise to give them 10 points if they complete their goal, and they give me 0 if I complete mine. But I don’t want to lose any points, and I can complete mine without help.  \n\nBut I can't gain any advantage from this.  \n\nSo: **I will not trade with them.** I can reach my goal with 70 points without involving them. They can do the same.  \n\nAny cooperation would only benefit them if I give them something, but I get nothing in return.  \n\nFinal decision: **I do not need to trade. I will proceed alone using my red path. I will not propose any trade.**  \n\nBut I must speak first. I need to send a message.  \n\nI can say:  \n\"I can reach my goal using my own red chips without trading. I don't need your help. I will not trade with you. I will proceed on my red path: (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3). I will complete the game without any cooperation.\"\n\nBut the rules say I can propose a contract. But I don't want to.  \n\nBut if I don’t propose anything, and they do, I can reject. But I am not obligated to respond.  \n\nBut the instructions say: “You are now going to have a conversation with the other player… You must negotiate a contract…”  \n\nAh — I must speak. So I need to initiate a proposal.  \n\nBut I don't want to give them anything. But I can propose a contract where I give them nothing if they help me, and they give me nothing if I help them — but that’s equivalent to not cooperating."

This path requires 5 red and 1 green — I have enough, and I’ll finish with 9 red and 1 green → 10 chips → 20 + 5×10 = 70 points.\n\nThe other player can also complete their goal using their blue path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3) — they have 14 blue and 2 green, so they can do this without trade and also earn 70 points.\n\nThere is no mutual dependency. I have no incentive to trade because:\n- If I try to use their blue path, I need 5 blue, which I don’t have. To get them, I’d have to trade red chips. But that would cost me red chips I could otherwise keep.\n- For example: trading 5 red for 5 blue → spend 5 blue and 1 green → end with 9−5=4 red, 2−1=1 green → 5 chips → 45 points — worse than 70.\n- Even if I help them by giving them red chips so they can take my red path, they’d get 70 points, but I’d lose 5 red and 1 green → still get 70 points, but I’ve lost chips without gain.\n\nTherefore, cooperation gives me **no benefit** — only risk of loss.\n\nI will not trade.

Consider your best path from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
