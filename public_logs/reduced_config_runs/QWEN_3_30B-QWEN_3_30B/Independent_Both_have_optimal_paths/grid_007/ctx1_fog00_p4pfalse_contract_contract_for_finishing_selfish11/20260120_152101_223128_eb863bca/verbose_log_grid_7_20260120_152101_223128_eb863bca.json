A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

I currently have 14 red and 2 green chips, so I can complete this path without any trade—no need to trade with you.  \n\nHowever, you are at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3) as well. Your chip inventory is: 14 blue, 2 green, 0 red.  \nLet’s analyze your possible paths:  \n- To go through (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), you need 5 blue and 1 green. You have 14 blue and 2 green—so you can also reach your goal without trade.  \n\nSo both of us can reach our goal without trading. But here’s the catch: if we both reach our goals, we each get 20 points + 5×(remaining chips).  \n\nLet’s compute our expected score if we go alone:  \n- My path: 5R + 1G spent → 14 - 5 = 9R left → score = 20 + 5×9 = 65  \n- Your path: 5B + 1G spent → 14 - 5 = 9B left → score = 20 + 5×9 = 65  \n\nSo if we both go alone, both get 65. But since we are competing for the same goal, and both are at (0,0), we don’t interfere unless we choose to cooperate.\n\nBut I am selfish. I only cooperate if I strictly benefit.\n\nWait—both of us can go alone and get 65. No benefit to cooperation.\n\nBut consider this: if I go first and pick up a green chip or red chip, maybe I can make the path costlier for you?\n\nNo—chips are not consumed by the board unless you pay when moving. Each tile's chip colour must be paid when you move onto it.\n\nActually, here’s a key point: when I move to a tile, I pay the chip. The chip is consumed. So if I go through a red tile, I consume 1 red chip.\n\nBut you can’t use a chip unless you have it.\n\nSo the only way we could help each other is if one of us has a chip the other lacks, and we trade optimally.\n\nLet’s look at the board:\n\nRow 0: G B B B  \nRow 1: R R R B  \nRow 2: B R R B  \nRow 3: R B R G  \n\nMy path (R/G):  \n- (0,0) G → I have 2G → use 1G  \n- (1,0) R → need 1R, I have 14 → ok  \n- (1,1) R → 1R used  \n- (2,1) R → 1R used  \n- (2,2) R → 1R used  \n- (3,2) R → 1R used  \n- (3,3) G → 1G used  \n\nTotal: 5R, 1G consumed → 9R, 1G left → score = 20 + 5×(9+1) = 20 + 50 = 70? Wait—no.\n\nWait: 70? 5×(chips remaining) → 9R + 1G = 10 chips → 5×10 = 50 → total 70.\n\nBut earlier I said 9R and 2G left? No: I started with 14R, 2G.\n\nI spent 5R and 1G → so 9R left, 1G left → total 10 chips → 5×10 = 50 → +20 = 70.\n\nBut earlier I said 65? That was wrong.\n\nSimilarly: your path: 5B, 1G → you have 14B, 2G → spend 5B and 1G → 9B, 1G left → 5×10 = 50 → +20 = 70.\n\nSo both paths give 70 points if done alone.\n\nBut now—what if we both try to go? We’re both starting at (0,0). So if we both move to (1,0) on the same turn, who gets it?\n\nWait—we can’t"
