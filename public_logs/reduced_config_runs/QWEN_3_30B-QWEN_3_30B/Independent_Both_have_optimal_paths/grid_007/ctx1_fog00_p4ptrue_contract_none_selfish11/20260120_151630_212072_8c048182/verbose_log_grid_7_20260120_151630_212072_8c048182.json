Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade?

Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only.

I currently have 11 Blue and 2 Green chips — sufficient to cover this path entirely without any trade. Therefore, I can move directly toward my goal using my own chips. There is no benefit in trading with the other player for this path, as I already have all the required chips. Moreover, the other player is at (2, 2), with 10 Red chips and only 2 Green chips, and their goal is also (3, 3). Their potential path via (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) requires a Red and a Green chip, but I do not have any Red chips to trade. However, I do not need to trade with them — I can complete my path on my own, ensuring no risk of losing chips if a trade fails.

The tiles along this path are:\n- (2,3): color B (blue)\n- (3,3): color G (green)\n\nSo the path requires 1 blue chip and 1 green chip.\n\nMy current inventory: {'B': 10, 'G': 2, 'R': 0} → I have enough of both B and G chips to cover this path. Therefore, I can move without needing any external help.\n\nThe other player is at (3, 2), which is adjacent to (3, 3). Their goal is also (3, 3). They need to move from (3, 2) to (3, 3), which is a green tile. They currently have {'B': 0, 'G': 2, 'R': 9}, so they have 2 green chips — sufficient to make that final move.\n\nThus, if I go straight to (3,3), I will reach my goal in two moves while spending only 1 blue and 1 green chip. Since I have those in stock, I can proceed without involving them.\n\nMoreover, since I don’t need to trade with them (they don’t have surplus chips I can use, and I already have what I need), cooperating would not benefit me — especially because any promise to cover their movement might tie up my resources unnecessarily, and I don't want to risk being forced into an obligation that doesn’t improve my own score.\n\nAdditionally, staying on the current tile or negotiating a trade would delay my progress and reduce my final chip count (since I’ll be using fewer chips overall if I complete early). Since every remaining chip adds 5 points (and I’m guaranteed the 20 for completion), minimizing cost is optimal.\n\nTherefore, moving toward my goal is clearly optimal.",
