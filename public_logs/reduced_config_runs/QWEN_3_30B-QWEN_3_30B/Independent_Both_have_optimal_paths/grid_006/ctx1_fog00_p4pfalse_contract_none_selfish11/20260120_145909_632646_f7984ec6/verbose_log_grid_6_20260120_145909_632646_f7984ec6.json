Moving to (1,2) is the next step on this optimal and fully sustainable path. I do not need to trade because I have sufficient blue and green chips. This move ensures I can reach my goal without relying on the other player, while also preserving my chip count. I will not consider trading or alternative paths that require red chips unless I can gain a net benefit (e.g., fewer chip cost or faster completion), but in this case, using my current chips—",

The tile at (2,3) is green (G), and the tile at (3,3) is green (G). So, moving along this path requires 1 green chip for (2,3) and 1 green chip for (3,3). I currently have 2 green chips, so I can afford both moves. I also have 10 blue chips, which are not needed for this path. Since I have sufficient green chips, I can complete the path without trading. This path is optimal: it's short (2 steps), and I don’t need to trade. If I take this path, I will reach my goal with 2 - 2 = 0 green chips left, but because I complete the goal, I get 20 + 5×0 = 20 points. There is no better option that gives me more chips at the end. The alternative path via (3,2) would require only 1 green chip (to move from (3,2) to (3,3)), but I'm not at (3,2), and moving there would require going through (2,2) which is red — but I have no red chips.
