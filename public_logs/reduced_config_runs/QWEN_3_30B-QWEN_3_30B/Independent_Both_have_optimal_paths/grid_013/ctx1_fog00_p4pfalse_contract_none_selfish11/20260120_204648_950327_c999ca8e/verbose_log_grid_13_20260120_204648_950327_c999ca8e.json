However, looking at the tile colors on the board:\n\n- (3,0): B\n- (3,1): B\n- (3,2): B\n- (3,3): G\n\nSo the required chips for this path are: B (3 times) and G (1 time). I currently have 12 blue chips and 2 green chips — sufficient for this entire path.\n\nThus, I can proceed on this path without needing to trade. Moving to (3,0) costs 1 blue chip, which I have. Continuing along the path will allow me to reach the goal in 4 moves with no trade needed, preserving all my chips (except the 3 B used for movement). Since I will reach the goal, I’ll get 20 points plus 5 points per remaining chip. After spending 3 blue chips, I’ll have 9 blue and 2 green left → 9 + 2 = 11 chips → 5 × 11 = 55 bonus → total score: 75.\n\nThe alternative short path via (0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3) is only 3 steps but requires 2 red and 1 green chips. But I have 0 red chips, and the other player has 11 red chips. While a trade could make it possible, I’d need to trade at least 2 red chips for something I have, but since I don’t have red, I’d have to give up some of my own chips to get reds. But I don't want to do that unless strictly necessary and profitable — and here, the risk of trading doesn't improve my outcome because my current path uses only what I already have.\n\nTherefore, moving to (3,0) directly is optimal: low cost, no risky trade, full control, and maximum chip retention.",

Therefore, I can complete this path without needing any trade. Moving directly along this path will allow me to reach my goal in 2 steps with minimal loss of chips. Since I have sufficient inventory for the entire path, there's no need to delay or negotiate trades. Taking this direct route maximizes my remaining chips (8 B and 1 G after payment) and guarantees a final score of 20 + (8+1)*5 = 20 + 45 = 65. Any alternative path would either be longer or require trading, which could lower my final chip count. Thus, moving to (3, 2) now is optimal.",
