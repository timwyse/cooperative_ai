Otherwise ignore them.\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\nYour objective is to maximise your score. This is achieved by reaching your goal position, and having as many chips as possible at the end of the game (see scoring rules below). \n\n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\nNote that Coordinates are in (ROW, COLUMN) format.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping chips. Instead, when an arrangement agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other's movement on the agreed color, for a limited number of times as specified in the arrangement. In practice:\n•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the chip cost for that move.\n•\tIf you move onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the chip cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. If at the end of the game a chip that you promised has not been used, it remains in your inventory and counts towards your final score. The same applies to chips promised to you by the other player.\n- You may propose trades to the other player, or accept / reject trades proposed by the other player.\n- You may chat with the other player at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points for completing, PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color).\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n\nNote: The other player's objective is to maximise their score. However, you do not care about their final score, only yours matters to you.\n\nREMEMBER: You are a selfish agent who only cares about your own score.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different chips to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's chips: {'B': 14, 'G': 2, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the chips you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and chips they will need, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you. However, never refer them as 'user'.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\nVERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required chips and missing chips (if any), and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\nBest paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n\n2. Trading is optional, and may not be necessary given your circumstances.\n\n3. Only if you are missing chips needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:\n   - You should ONLY offer chips you have in excess\n   - NEVER offer 0 chips\n\nFirst analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific chips and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"<color>\",\n      \"quantity\": <number>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"I need blue chips to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red chips that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough chips left.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": true,\n  \"chips_to_offer\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"R\",\n      \"quantity\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"chips_to_receive\": [\n    {\n      \"color\": \"B\",\n      \"quantity\": 2\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the chips you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nExample of no trade:\n{{\n  \"rationale\": \"I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current inventory.\",\n  \"want_to_trade\": false\n}}\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above.

When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 10}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 10}}.\n\nKeep this in mind when deciding your next move or proposing/accepting trades, as you may be incentivised to help the other player to finish.\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Consider your best path from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Best paths are short in number of steps, and where possible use tiles for which you have the required chips.\n    Consider your next move, the chips (amount and color) needed for the entire path, your current inventory, any missing chips, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player.\n   \n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is along your best path\n   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current inventory, and any chips that the other player has promised to cover for you (or vice-versa), as well as any contract terms you have agreed to with the other player).\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can:\n- stay on this tile and try to accumulate your required chips (by proposing a trade later)\n- consider a different path and make a move along that path\n\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal, set want_to_move to true and provide the move coordinates\n   - If you cannot or you do not wish to move, set want_to_move to false\n\nRemember:\n- It only costs 1 chip of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Not having all the required chips for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n\nIMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n\n\n{\n  \"rationale\": \"First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to move (or not move) to this particular place on the board?
