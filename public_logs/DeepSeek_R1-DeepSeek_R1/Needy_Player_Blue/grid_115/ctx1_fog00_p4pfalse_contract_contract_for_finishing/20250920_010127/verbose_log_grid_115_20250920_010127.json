You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

still need 1r to make any move\n3. opponent still needs b (they have 0) and has r (12 available)\n4. increasing my offer to 3b for 1r makes it more enticing while:\n   - still being affordable for me (i have 14b)\n   - doesn't jeopardize my path (only need 4b total for goal)\n   - gives them more incentive to accept\n\nthis is essentially paying a higher \"premium\" to break my current deadlock, as i cannot progress without red resources. the increased offer may overcome their previous reluctance.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: n\n\nanalysis:\n1. current position: (0,0) -
