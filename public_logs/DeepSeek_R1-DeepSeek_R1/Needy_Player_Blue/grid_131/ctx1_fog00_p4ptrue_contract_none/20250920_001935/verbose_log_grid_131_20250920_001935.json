This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors.

Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
            "agent_response": "\"n\"\n\n(explanation:\n- after carefully reviewing the board and my resources:\n  - all adjacent moves require red (r) resources (positions (1,0) and (0,1) are both red)\n  - i have zero red resources (r:0)\n  - all trade offers for red have been repeatedly rejected up to very generous 5b:2r ratios\n- therefore, i cannot make any valid moves at this time\n- strategic considerations:\n  1) must maintain current position (0,0) until trade options become available\n  2) should propose a less demanding trade - perhaps 2b for 1r to secure just one red move\n  3) alternative path planning:\n     - if i could get 1 red, could try: (0,0)→(1,0)[r]→(1,1)[b] (but (1,1) is actually blue)\n     - but this still requires initial red move\n- next steps:\n  - will propose final scaled-down trade offer next turn if still stuck\n  - if that fails, may need to accept that mutual beneficial trade is impossible\n  - hoping opponent will recognize deadlock and become more cooperative\n- this is not an ideal situation but reflects the constraints) \n\nthis move represents my inability to progress without cooperation from the opponent, despite multiple generous offers. i remain ready to negotiate but cannot proceed alone under current circumstances."
