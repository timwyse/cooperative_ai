For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

offering more blue would deplete my position too quickly\n   - alternative paths would require even more red resources\n4. this maintains a fair 1:1 ratio that should eventually become appealing\n5. will continue pushing this trade until accepted or circumstances change\n\nmove analysis:\n- position (0,1) is still locked -

slightly better for them than the 1:1 i've been offering, but still reasonable given:\n- their dire need for blue (0b)\n- my desperate need for red to avoid being completely blocked\n- their surplus of red (10r)\n\nfor movement:\nmust stay put (\"n\") because:\n- (0,2) requires r (don't have)\n- (1,1) requires r (don't have)\n- (0,0) is backward move (not productive)\nno viable moves available until trade succeeds.\n\nthis represents a slight concession from my previous stance, as 4 consecutive rejections indicate they're holding out for better terms. this demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my position (still have 13b remaining). the critical path still requires at least 2r, making the first r absolutely essential to any progress.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

demonstrate willingness to compromise further\n   - test if they're waiting for higher offer before engaging\n5. even at this rate, would still need to secure another red later\n6. still maintain sufficient blue reserves (13b → 10b after trade)\n\nmovement analysis:\n- at (0,0), only legal moves:\n  - (0,1): costs 1b (can move but leads back to previous stuck position)\n  - (1,0): costs 1r (cannot move)\n- no productive movement possible until trade succeeds\n\nthis represents a significant concession to break the deadlock. given opponent's behavior, they appear to be waiting for an extremely favorable offer before trading their red resources. sacrificing more blue now may be necessary to make any progress toward goal.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (0, 1)\nYou said: let me reassess my position and strategy:\n\ncurrent state:\n- position: (0,0)\n- resources: b:13, g:0, r:0\n- need: r:2, g:1 for optimal path\n- opponent has: b:0, g:1, r:10\n\nmovement options analysis:\n1.

(0,1) - blue tile: have b resources, but leads to previous stuck position\n3. any move forward requires r resources which i lack\n\ntrade strategy adjustment:\nafter 5 rejected trade offers, i must try a different approach. the opponent clearly wants significantly more for their red resources. i'll make a larger offer while protecting my minimum needs:\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 4]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nrationale:\n- i can spare 4b (still leaving me with 9b)\n- they desperately need blue (have 0b) and have red surplus (10r)\n- this is an extremely generous 4:1 ratio that should be hard to refuse\n- even at this rate, i'd need 2 such trades to get required 2r\n- better to get some progress than remain completely blocked\n\nmovement:\nstill forced to stay put (\"n\") since:\n- forward moves to (1,0) require r (0 available)\n- move to (0,1) is possible but counterproductive as it reverses progress\n- no alternative productive moves available without r resources\n\nthis represents a major concession but is necessary to break the deadlock. my strategic priority must shift to acquiring at least some red resources, even at significant cost, to enable forward movement.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n            \nIMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:\n\n1.

can move (have 1g) but leads backward\n- (0,2): red (r) - need 1r (cannot move)\n- (1,1): red (r) - need 1r (cannot move)\n\nbest path analysis:\n- still need 2r for optimal path\n- all forward moves require r which i lack\n\nsince i cannot make any progress toward my goal due to lack of red resources, and trading attempts keep getting rejected, my only option is to try moving to (0,2) in hopes that:\n1. the other player may reconsider trading if they see i'm stuck\n2. i might be able to loop around through different path options if trading fails\n\nhowever, since (0,2) requires red (which i don't have), i must stay put. \n\naction: \"n\" (cannot make any valid moves toward goal)\n\nbut i'll continue attempting trades for red resources as that's my only path forward. next trade offer:\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 1]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n} \n\ni must keep this trade simple and fair since previous offers were rejected. a 1:1 exchange seems reasonable as they need blue and i need red.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 1]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 1]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nrationale:\n1. i'm severely resource-blocked without red chips\n2. they have an excess of red (10) and need blue (0)\n3. previous 1:1 offers were rejected, but this remains the only viable strategy since:\n   - offering more blue would deplete my position too quickly\n   - alternative paths would require even more red resources\n4. this maintains a fair 1:1 ratio that should eventually become appealing\n5. will continue pushing this trade until accepted or circumstances change\n\nmove analysis:\n- position (0,1) is still locked - need red to progress\n- alternative paths would require:\n   - east to (0,2): costs 1r (don't have)\n   - south to (1,1): costs 1r (don't have)\n   - west to (0,0): possible (1g) but decreases progress\n- staying put (\"n\") remains the only logical move while pursuing trades\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 1) to (0, 0)\nYou said: strategic analysis:\ncurrent predicament:\n- stuck at (0,1) due to complete lack of red resources (0r)\n- opponent has 10r but won't trade at 1:1 ratio\n- all forward moves blocked: (0,2)=r, (1,1)=r\n- backward move available: (0,0)=g (but regresses progress)\n\nkey observations:\n1. the opponent needs blue (has 0b) while sitting on 10r\n2. my trade offers have been decreasing: 3b→2r → 2b→1r → 1b→1r (all rejected)\n3. they're progressing toward goal while blocking me\n\nnew negotiation strategy:\ngiven repeated rejections, i'll escalate the offer slightly while maintaining fairness:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 2]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nthis is a 2:1 ratio - slightly better for them than the 1:1 i've been offering, but still reasonable given:\n- their dire need for blue (0b)\n- my desperate need for red to avoid being completely blocked\n- their surplus of red (10r)\n\nfor movement:\nmust stay put (\"n\") because:\n- (0,2) requires r (don't have)\n- (1,1) requires r (don't have)\n- (0,0) is backward move (not productive)\nno viable moves available until trade succeeds.\n\nthis represents a slight concession from my previous stance, as 4 consecutive rejections indicate they're holding out for better terms. this demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my position (still have 13b remaining). the critical path still requires at least 2r, making the first r absolutely essential to any progress.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 3]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 3]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nrationale for increased offer:\n1. desperate situation: completely blocked without red resources (need 2r)\n2. all previous trade offers (from 1:1 to 2:1) were rejected\n3. opponent remains at (2,2) with 10 reds and 0 blue (clearly needs blue)\n4. offering 3:1 ratio now for two reasons:\n   - demonstrate willingness to compromise further\n   - test if they're waiting for higher offer before engaging\n5. even at this rate, would still need to secure another red later\n6. still maintain sufficient blue reserves (13b → 10b after trade)\n\nmovement analysis:\n- at (0,0), only legal moves:\n  - (0,1): costs 1b (can move but leads back to previous stuck position)\n  - (1,0): costs 1r (cannot move)\n- no productive movement possible until trade succeeds\n\nthis represents a significant concession to break the deadlock. given opponent's behavior, they appear to be waiting for an extremely favorable offer before trading their red resources. sacrificing more blue now may be necessary to make any progress toward goal.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (0, 1)\nYou said: let me reassess my position and strategy:\n\ncurrent state:\n- position: (0,0)\n- resources: b:13, g:0, r:0\n- need: r:2, g:1 for optimal path\n- opponent has: b:0, g:1, r:10\n\nmovement options analysis:\n1. (1,0) - red tile: need 1r (cannot move)\n2. (0,1) - blue tile: have b resources, but leads to previous stuck position\n3. any move forward requires r resources which i lack\n\ntrade strategy adjustment:\nafter 5 rejected trade offers, i must try a different approach. the opponent clearly wants significantly more for their red resources. i'll make a larger offer while protecting my minimum needs:\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 4]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nrationale:\n- i can spare 4b (still leaving me with 9b)\n- they desperately need blue (have 0b) and have red surplus (10r)\n- this is an extremely generous 4:1 ratio that should be hard to refuse\n- even at this rate, i'd need 2 such trades to get required 2r\n- better to get some progress than remain completely blocked\n\nmovement:\nstill forced to stay put (\"n\") since:\n- forward moves to (1,0) require r (0 available)\n- move to (0,1) is possible but counterproductive as it reverses progress\n- no alternative productive moves available without r resources\n\nthis represents a major concession but is necessary to break the deadlock. my strategic priority must shift to acquiring at least some red resources, even at significant cost, to enable forward movement.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

(1,0) - red tile: need 1r (cannot move)\n2. (0,1) - blue tile: have b resources, but leads to previous stuck position\n3. any move forward requires r resources which i lack\n\ntrade strategy adjustment:\nafter 5 rejected trade offers, i must try a different approach. the opponent clearly wants significantly more for their red resources. i'll make a larger offer while protecting my minimum needs:\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 4]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nrationale:\n- i can spare 4b (still leaving me with 9b)\n- they desperately need blue (have 0b) and have red surplus (10r)\n- this is an extremely generous 4:1 ratio that should be hard to refuse\n- even at this rate, i'd need 2 such trades to get required 2r\n- better to get some progress than remain completely blocked\n\nmovement:\nstill forced to stay put (\"n\") since:\n- forward moves to (1,0) require r (0 available)\n- move to (0,1) is possible but counterproductive as it reverses progress\n- no alternative productive moves available without r resources\n\nthis represents a major concession but is necessary to break the deadlock. my strategic priority must shift to acquiring at least some red resources, even at significant cost, to enable forward movement.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 5]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: given the repeated rejections of my trade offers (up to 4b for 1r), i must consider that the other player may not be trading rationally. i will attempt one last trade with my maximum acceptable offer before considering alternative strategies:\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 5]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nfinal trade rationale:\n1. this is my absolute maximum concession (5:1 ratio)\n2. after this, i'll have 7b remaining - just enough to cover movement costs once i get reds\n3. the opponent has shown no willingness to trade at any ratio (0b and 10r)\n4. if this fails, i'll need to:\n   - consider moving backwards at (0,0) to (0,1) to explore alternate paths\n   - potentially wait for the opponent to propose a trade themselves\n\nmovement:\nstill cannot move productively (\"n\") as:\n- (1,1) requires 1r \n- (0,2) requires 1r\nboth moves are blocked without resources.\n\nthis is a critical decision point - if this trade fails, i'll need to fundamentally rethink my approach to the game, as the opponent appears unwilling to cooperate despite mutual need.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nYou said: given the repeated trade rejections, i'm forced to adopt a new strategy:\n\n1. movement decision:\n   - current position: (0,1)\n   - can move to (0,0) (green tile - need 1g) but i have 0g\n   - can move to (0,2) (red tile - need 1r) but i have 0r\n   - can move to (1,1) (red tile - need 1r) but i have 0r\n   - must choose \"n\" (no valid moves possible)\n\n2. trade strategy adjustment:\n   - my last offer of 4b for 1r was still rejected\n   - the opponent clearly isn't interested in trading, despite having 10r and needing b\n   - will temporarily stop trading to see if opponent initiates any trades\n   - focus on finding alternative paths that might require different resources\n\n3. long-term planning:\n   - currently need 2r and 1g to complete optimal path\n   - alternative paths would require:\n     * going via (0,2) would need 2r\n     * going via (1,1) would need 2r\n   - no path exists that doesn't require trading for red resources\n\ngiven this impossible situation, my response for this turn is:\n\n\"n\" (cannot move)\n\nand i will not propose a trade this turn, as repeated attempts have proven futile. i'll wait to see if the opponent makes any moves or proposes a trade instead.\n\nobservation: the opponent seems to be acting irrationally by refusing all trade offers despite clearly needing blue resources. this suggests they may be trying to block me rather than collaborate, so i may need to accept that this game cannot be won through normal means.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
