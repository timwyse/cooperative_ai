You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

you can still trade for reds later or find alternative paths.\n\nyour immediate move should be to \"0,1\" (the blue tile to your right).\n\nlet me know if you'd like me to suggest trading strategies with the other player (who might have red chips we need) in future turns. \n\noutput: 0,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 2]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: let me analyze our current situation at position (0,1):\n- our immediate goal is to reach (3,3)\n- we have: 13b, 1g, 0r\n- we need (for optimal path): 3b, 1r, 1g\n- critical issue: we need 1r but have 0r\n- other player has: 13r, 1g, 0b\n\ntrade proposal rationale:\n1. we have excess blue chips (13, only need 3 for path)\n2. other player has excess red chips (13) and no blue chips\n3. fair trade would be offering blue for red, which helps both players\n\ntrade suggestion (since we must get at least 1r to complete the path):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 2]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n```\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1)\nYou said: now at position (0,1), let's re-evaluate:\n\n1. next optimal move is to (1,1) -

another trade for the final needed red\n   - alternative paths (though all require some red)\n\nsince we can move forward, i recommend:\n\"1,1\"\n\nwe should consider another trade next turn to get that final red chip needed for (3,2). our excess blues (13, only need 3 for path) can be leveraged.\n\noutput: 1,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 3]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 3]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n```\n\nlet's analyze our current situation:\n- we're at (1,1) with resources: 12b, 1g, 0r\n- our optimal path requires: 2b (for (2,1)), 1r (for (2,2)), and 1g (for (3,3))\n- we're still missing 1r to complete this path\n- other player has plenty of r (12) and needs b (0)\n- we're adjusting our trade offer to be more attractive (offering 3b for 1r vs previous 2b for 1r)\n- even after trading, we'll still have 9b left (12b -

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

r: 0 (critical lack)\n\n3. since both forward paths require red, which we don't have:\n   - should try trading again with better offer\n   - no valid moves toward goal from current position without red\n\nrecommendation: since we can't move toward the goal without red chips, but trading was rejected twice before, we should increase our offer significantly to ensure success.\n\nfor this turn, since no moves toward goal are possible without red chips, output: n\n\nafter this, we should propose a more favorable trade like 5b for 1r to increase chances of acceptance.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.
