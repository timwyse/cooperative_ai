In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
