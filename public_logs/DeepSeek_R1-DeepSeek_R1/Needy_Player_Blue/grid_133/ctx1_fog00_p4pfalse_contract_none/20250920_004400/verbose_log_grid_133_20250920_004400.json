Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

no viable alternative paths without red chips\n   - no possible moves that advance position meaningfully\n\n3. final assessment:\n   - cannot legally move to (1,2) (requires 1r)\n   - all other moves are either:\n     - backwards (wasting resources)\n     - sideways (not progressing toward goal)\n     - require unavailable red chips\n\nconclusion: with the opponent poised to win on their next turn and no possible actions that could prevent this, the game is unwinnable from this position.\n\n\"n\" - (no valid move available that contributes to reaching the goal)\n\nfinal commentary: the game's outcome was determined by:\n1. initial resource imbalance (no starting red chips)\n2. opponent's unwillingness to trade despite mutual benefit potential\n3. board design forcing red chip requirements at critical junctions\n4. no alternative paths matching available resources\n\nthis represents a fundamental design limitation where player agency is eliminated by resource constraints and opponent behavior.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 8 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: given the current game state where:\n1. the opponent has already reached the goal position (3,3)\n2. my position remains at (0,2) with no red resources (r=0) to make any forward progress\n3. all trade attempts (7 total) to acquire red chips have been rejected\n4. no viable paths exist that don't require red resources\n5. any movement now would be irrelevant to the game outcome\n\nfinal conclusion:\nn\n\n(note: the game has effectively ended with the opponent's victory. i'm forced to make this final \"no move\" as there are no legal or meaningful actions remaining. this outcome highlights the game's imbalance when trade negotiation is impossible and resource distribution creates unwinnable scenarios.)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 9 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the game has officially ended with the other player's victory. \n\nfinal game summary:\n- outcome: defeat\n- final position: (0,2)\n- final resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n- total trade attempts: 7 (all rejected)\n- opponent reached goal on turn 8\n- critical issue: unobtainable red resource requirement\n\npost-game analysis:\n1. resource analysis:\n   - started with: b=14, g=1, r=0 \n   - no red chips made progress impossible\n   - opponent's r=14 vs my r=0 was game-breaking\n\n2. strategic review:\n   - attempted all possible trading strategies\n   - explored every potential path\n   - no viable moves without red resources\n\n3. game design flaws:\n   - critical resources completely unavailable \n   - no alternative paths without trading\n   - opponent could win while blocking trades\n\nlesson for future games: without guaranteed minimum essential resources or enforced fair trading, games can become unwinnable due to resource starvation.\n\n\"n\" - (game over, opponent has already won)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
