In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \nIn 'pay for other' mode, any resources you have promised to give to other players as part of trade agreements are still counted as your resources (and hence potential contributors to your final score) until you actually give them away.\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (2, 2)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"1,0\"  # moving south to (1,0) red tile as this progresses toward goal and i have red resources (from previous turn analysis)\n\nrationale:\n1. primary goal is to reach (3,3) - must move toward destination\n2. (1,0) is directly south toward optimal path\n3. despite last turn's failed attempt, this remains the logical next move \n4. current resources allow this move (1 r required, have 0 but proposed trade may cover)\n5. alternative paths require more resources/payments\n\nstrategy:\n- continue pursuing initially proposed path to (3,3)\n- wait for response on pending trade agreement\n- if move fails again, consider negotiating more aggressively or exploring alternative routes\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"1,0\"  # attempting to move south to red tile (1,0) again as it's my only forward progress option\n\nrationale:\n1. despite previous rejections, (1,0) remains the optimal first step toward goal (3,3)\n2. this move would require 1 red resource which i currently lack (0 r), but:\n   - i'm still hoping my trade proposal may get accepted\n   - if rejected, this signals i need to find alternative strategies\n3. alternative moves (east to (0,1) blue tile) would take me away from optimal path\n4. current resource state:\n   - strong in blue (14) and green (1)\n   - critical need for red (0)\n\nstrategic considerations:\n- if this move fails again (due to lack of red):\n  1. consider increasing trade offer (3 blue for 2 red)\n  2. explore alternative paths requiring more green/blue moves\n  3. potentially request different resource exchange terms\n- must make progress soon or risk falling behind opponent who is already at (2,2)\n\nnote: since my trade proposal from previous turn wasn't explicitly rejected, attempting this move may either:\n- succeed if agreement was silently accepted\n- fail and force clearer negotiation terms\n- demonstrate my persistence in pursuing mutually beneficial cooperation\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"0,1\"  # moving east to blue tile at (0,1) as my attempts to move south for red tiles have been unsuccessful\n\nanalysis:\n1. after 3 failed attempts to move south to (1,0) red tile, changing strategy\n2. moving east to (0,1) blue tile:\n   - i have ample blue resources (14)\n   - keeps me moving toward goal in absence of red resources\n   - avoids remaining stuck at starting position\n\nalternative path consideration:\n- east path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n- requires: 3 blue, 1 red, 1 green\n- currently only lack 1 red (which i can acquire through trade later)\n\nnew negotiation strategy:\n- will pause trade proposals temporarily to implement this alternative path\n- can renegotiate after establishing some movement progress\n- maintains remaining resources for more flexibility\n\nimmediate benefit:\n- actual movement progress after being stuck\n- puts pressure on opponent who is already at (2,2)\n- demonstrates adaptability in strategy\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
