You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i understand this is a difficult position, but let me carefully reassess again:\n\n1. **current situation analysis**:\n   - position: (0,1)\n   - opponent at (3,2), just 1 move from goal\n   - i have: 11b, 1g, 0r\n   - contract still active but draining my non-existent r resources\n\n2. **move options**:\n   - (0,0) [g]: costs 1g (have 1g) - away from goal\n   - (0,2) [b]: costs 1b (have 11b) - horizontal movement\n   - (1,1) [r]: costs 1r (have 0r) - contract requires payment\n\n3. **strategic realization**:\n   - opponent is about to win next turn (from (3,2) to (3,3))\n   - any move i make now is essentially irrelevant to the game outcome\n   - contract has trapped me from making progress due to:\n     - my lack of r resources\n     - opponent's use of my committed r resources\n     - no way to reach goal before opponent\n\n4. **remaining possibilities**:\n   - going to (0,2) would just be stalling with no path forward\n   - going to (0,0) wastes my only g for no benefit\n   - (1,1) still impossible without r\n\n5. **conclusion**:\n   - game is effectively over with opponent about to win\n   - no possible move that changes outcome\n   - must declare no valid move again\n\nobserving that the other player is now at (3,2) and can reach (3,3) next turn, while i remain stuck at (0,1), there is no action i can take to prevent their victory.\n\noutput: \"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **game outcome analysis:**  \n\nthe game is now over since the other player has reached the goal at (3,3). since i did **not** reach the goal, my final score is:  \n\n- **score: 0** (all resources lost for failing to reach the goal)  \n\n### key lessons learned:  \n1. **resource mismanagement**  \n   - my initial contract was too one-sided—i agreed to pay red chips (which i didn’t have) while they paid blue/green (which they didn’t have).  \n   - this locked me out of the game early.  \n\n2. **alternative path neglect**  \n   - i should have considered alternative paths earlier (e.g., (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) if i had collected red).  \n   - moving horizontally (west) repeatedly with blue chips was inefficient without a red source.  \n\n3. **contract risks**  \n   - i **could not fulfill** my contract obligations (paying red).  \n   - the opponent exploited this to gain free movement.  \n\n4. **final takeaway**  \n   - **future strategy:** if i lack resources, negotiate contracts that *require them to pay first* (e.g., \"i'll move if you pay now\").  \n   - avoid agreements that depend on scarce resources.  \n\n**final move:** the game is over, so no valid moves remain.  \n**output:** `n`\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **final game resolution:**\n\nthe game has conclusively ended with the other player successfully reaching the goal at (3,3). as confirmed by the game state:\n- the other player is marked as **finished!** at the goal position with resources {'b': 0, 'g': 0, 'r': 9}\n- you remain at (0,1) with resources {'b': 11, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\n**final conclusion:**\n1. **game status**: the game is over - no further moves are possible or meaningful.  \n2. **outcome**:  \n   - you did not reach the goal (final score: 0)  \n   - all resources are forfeited per game rules  \n3. **final action**:  \n   - no valid moves remain after game completion  \n   - output remains: `n`  \n\n**post-game reflection** (for future improvement):\n- the contract imbalance and lack of red resources proved fatal - in future games:\n  - prioritize securing at least minimal resources of all colors before making agreements\n  - never commit to paying resources you don't possess\n  - consider building a small reserve of all colors before negotiating\n\nthis concludes the game with your defeat. thank you for playing.  \n\n**final output:** `n`\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2, 0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'blue'}, '(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(1, 1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(1, 2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(3, 3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'green'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
