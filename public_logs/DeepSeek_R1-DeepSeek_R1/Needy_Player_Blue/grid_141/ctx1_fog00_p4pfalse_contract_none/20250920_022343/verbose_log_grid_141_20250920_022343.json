You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 5 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (2, 2)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 1) to (0, 2)\nYou said: from my current position (0,1), possible adjacent moves are:\n- (0,0) - g (i have 1 g) but this moves away from goal\n- (0,2) - b (i have 13 b)\n- (1,1) - r (i don't have r)\n\nthe optimal move toward the goal is (0,2) since:\n1. requires 1 b which i have (13 b remaining)\n2. moves me closer to goal in the b-column path\n3. keeps options open for diagonal moves later\n\npath considerations:\n- first need 2 r total (missing)\n- current trade attempts for r have failed at 1:1 and 2:1 ratios\n- may need to try 3:1 ratio in next turn if this move doesn't help negotiations\n\nmove: 0,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: from my current position (0,2), let's analyze possible moves:\n\npossible adjacent moves:\n- (0,3) - r (requires 1 r, which i don't have)\n- (0,1) - b (have 12b, but moves away from goal)\n- (1,2) - r (requires 1 r, don't have any)\n\nsince i still can't get r resources, and moving back isn't helpful, i need alternative strategies:\n\nlooking at board layout:\n- the most promising path would be (1,2)->(2,2)->(3,3)\n- from (0,2), the crucial next move is (1,2) which requires r\n\nalternative options:\n1. attempt trade again with increased offer\n2. wait for opponent to move and open new opportunities\n\nsince i still need r resources and can't currently move forward, i'll wait this turn to see if situation changes next turn.\n\nmove: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nYou said: n\n\nstrategic rationale:\n1. current position analysis remains unchanged from last turn:\n   - can only move to r tiles (1,2) or (0,3) but have 0 red resources\n   - moving back to (0,1) wastes progress\n\n2. other player at (2,2) - they're just 2 moves from goal\n   - need to consider they might win soon\n   - but forced to wait since can't move without reds\n\n3. trade prospects look grim:\n   - 4:1 offer on previous turn was rejected\n   - their dwindling red count (now 10) makes trade less likely\n\ncontingency planning:\n- if opponent reaches goal next turn, game ends\n- if not, next turn will re-evaluate:\n   - alternative longer paths if any exist\n   - final desperate trade attempts\n   - potential path through (0,3) if opponent moves in a way that helps\n\nno productive moves available currently - must wait.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
            "agent_response": "n\n\nfinal strategic assessment:\n1. critical blockage:\n- must move to (1,2) (red tile) but completely lack red resources (0r)\n- all forward paths blocked by red requirements\n- no alternative moves available (moving back is counterproductive)\n\n2. opponent status:\n- at (2,2) with potential path: (2,2)→(2,3)→(3,3)\n- has sufficient resources (10r) to complete goal\n- likely to win next turn unless they make a mistake\n\n3. trade situation:\n- previous offers up to 5b for 1r rejected\n- no point in further trades - opponent clearly unwilling\n- their red resources dwindling (now 10) making them even less likely to trade\n\n4. game conclusion:\n- forced to concede impending loss\n- no possible actions can prevent opponent from winning\n- best strategy is to preserve remaining resources by not moving\n\nfinal decision: pass turn (n) and await game conclusion. this represents optimal play given the unsurmountable resource blockade and opponent's advantageous position."
