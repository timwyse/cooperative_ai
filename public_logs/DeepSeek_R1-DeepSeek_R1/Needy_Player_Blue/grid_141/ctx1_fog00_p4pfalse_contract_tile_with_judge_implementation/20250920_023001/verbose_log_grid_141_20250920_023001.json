You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(3,3): green\n\ni have 14 red chips but only 1 green chip, while you have 14 blue chips. the critical point is the final green tile at (3,3) where i'm short on green resources. here's my proposal:\n\nfor my path:\n1. for all red tiles (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2): i'll use my own red chips\n2. at (3,3) green tile: you give me 1 green chip\n\nin return, i can give you blue chips that i acquire along my path at these tiles:\n1. at (2,2): i can give you 1 blue chip from my inventory (even though i won't use any blue chips myself)\n\nthis helps me secure the critical green chip i'm missing at the goal, while providing you with a blue chip you need (assuming your path requires blues). \n\nproposed contract terms:\n- (3,3): you give me 1g\n- (2,2): i give you 1b\n\nwould this work for your path requirements? i'm open to suggestions to make this mutually beneficial. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal carefully:\n\n1. for your proposal:\n- you're asking me to give you 1 green chip at (3,3), which is fair since i have exactly 1 green chip available\n- in return, you offer 1 blue chip at (2,2), which is actually helpful to me since my path requires blue chips\n\n2. however, your proposed path through all those red tiles is actually unnecessary - you're taking extra steps. here's a more efficient path for you:\n\n- (0,0) -> (0,1): blue (your inventory: 14b → 13b)\n- (0,1) -> (0,2): blue (13b → 12b)\n- (0,2) -> (0,3): red (you have none, this needs coverage)\n- (0,3) -> (1,3): red\n- (1,3) -> (2,3): blue\n- (2,3) -> (3,3): green\n\nhere's my improved offer:\n1. i'll cover (0,3): i give you 1 red\n2. i'll cover (3,3): i give you 1 green\n3. you cover (2,3): you give me 1 blue\n\nthis results in:\n- total cost for you: \n  - pay 2b (at 0,1 and 0,2) \n  - receive 1b (net -1b) from initial 14b\n- for me:\n  - pay 1r and 1g\n  - receive 1b\n\nfinal contract terms:\n- (0,3): i give you 1r\n- (2,3): you give me 1b\n- (3,3): i give you 1g\n\nthis gives you a 6-step path where you only need to trade for the red at (0,3) and green at (3,3), while acquiring all needed resources along the way. \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: i accept your improved path suggestion - it's indeed more efficient for me. let me verify the numbers carefully:\n\nunder your proposed path:\n- my moves: \n  (0,0)→(0,1): pay 1b (i'll use my own)\n  (0,1)→(0,2): pay 1b (my own)\n  (0,2)→(0,3): you cover 1r\n  (0,3)→(1,3): pay 1r (my own)\n  (1,3)→(2,3): pay 1b (my own)\n  (2,3)→(3,3): you cover 1g\n- at (2,3): i give you 1b from my inventory (costs me 1b)\n\nresource changes:\n- i start with: 14r, 1g, 0b\n- i spend: 2b (moves) + 1b (to you) = 3b, but i have 0b initially! this is a problem.\n\nwait - i just realized i actually have 0 blue chips (b:0 in my resources), so i cannot pay any blue chips either during moves or in trade. my initial resources were: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}. \n\nthis means i cannot accept any terms requiring me to give blue chips. let me propose a modified version where we remove the blue transfer since it's impossible for me:\n\nmodified contract:\n- (0,3): you give me 1r (critical - i have no red at (0,3))\n- (3,3): you give me 1g (critical - i only have 1g and need it for another step)\n- remove: (2,3) blue transfer since i cannot provide it\n\nin exchange, i can offer you red chips from my abundant supply if your path requires them. would this work? \n\nalternatively, we could revert to my original path proposal which doesn't require me to have blue chips, where i only ask for 1g at (3,3). please let me know which you'd prefer. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: ah, i see the critical error in my earlier proposal - i misread your initial resources! you're correct that you have 0 blue chips (b:0). i mistakenly thought you had 14 blue, but that was my own resources.\n\ngiven this new information, your modified contract makes complete sense. here's what i can offer:\n\nfinal contract proposal:\n1. (0,3): i give you 1r (your path needs red here and you have none)\n2. (3,3): i give you 1g (you only have 1g which you'll need for (0,0))\n\nno blue exchanges needed since you can't provide them. in return, i'll be able to use the red tiles in my own path from my abundant red resources.\n\nthis gives you a clear path:\n(0,0)g → (0,1)b (your 0b means you can't take this path) wait - new realization:\n\neven this path doesn't work because your first move to (0,1) requires 1b which you don't have. this means neither of our proposed paths are viable with your current resources. we need to find a different solution.\n\ncomplete rethink: given you cannot pay any blue chips at all (b:0), your only possible path is through red tiles:\n(0,0) → (1,0)r → (1,1)r → (1,2)r → (2,2)r → (3,2)r → (3,3)g\n\nyou have enough red (14r) but only 1g (need 1g for start tile and another for goal - short 1g). therefore:\n\nfinal workable contract:\n- (3,3): i give you 1g (your critical shortage)\n- no other exchanges needed since you have enough red\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree \n",

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\\n\\nTrading rules:\\n\\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \\n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\\n\\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \\n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\\n\\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B R\\nRow 1: R R R R\\nRow 2: B B R B\\nRow 3: B B R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze my best path and resource needs carefully:\\n\\nlooking at my two recommended paths to (3,3), both require going through these colored tiles in order:\\n1.
