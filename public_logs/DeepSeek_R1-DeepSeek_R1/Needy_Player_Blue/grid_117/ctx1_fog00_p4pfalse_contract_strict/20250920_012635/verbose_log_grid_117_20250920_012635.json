            "system_prompt": "\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 1)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me analyze my current situation carefully:\n\n1. current position: (3,1) - red tile (already paid for via contract)\n2. resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n3. available moves:\n   - left to (3,0) - blue (i have b=10, but moves away from goal)\n   - right to (3,2) - red (i need r=1, but have r=0)\n   - up to (2,1) - red (covered by contract but backwards)\n\n4. critical observations:\n   - the other player is already at (3,2) competing for the same goal\n   - my path: (3,2)[r]→(3,3)[g]\n     - (3,2) requires r (i have 0)\n     - (3,3) requires g (i have 1)\n   - other player has r=9, i have none\n   - contract does not cover (3,2)\n\n5. immediate options:\n   - right to (3,2): impossible (no r resources)\n   - up to (2,1): would go backwards and waste contract benefits\n   - left to (3,0): pointless backtracking\n   - stay (not allowed unless no moves possible) \n\n6. strategic considerations:\n   - i need 1 red chip to complete my path\n   - other player has plenty of red (9) but no blue\n   - i have blue (10) which they might want for (2,2)\n   - possible trade: offer to pay for their (2,2) move (costs me 1b) in exchange for 1r\n\ngiven i must make a move but cannot currently move forward, and the other player is blocking (3,2), my options are limited.\n\n\"n\" (i cannot make any valid move toward the goal)\n\nhowever, since \"n\" ends the game and i'm at (3,1) so close to goal, perhaps i should negotiate a trade immediately.\n\nbut per the rules, since i cannot move toward goal and must output \"n\" if no moves possible, the correct output is:\n\"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 3)\nYou said: game over analysis:\n\n1. current status:\n- my position: (3,1)\n- goal: (3,3)\n- resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n- opponent has already reached (3,3) and won\n\n2. immediate observations:\n- the other player has successfully reached the goal at (3,3)\n- they've used their last green chip to do so (their g count dropped to 0)\n- all my remaining moves are now irrelevant since the game ends when any player reaches the goal\n- per the rules: \"game ends when any player reaches the goal tile\"\n  \n3. final considerations:\n- i could move right to (3,2) if i had r chips, but:\n  - i have no r resources\n  - the game is already over\n- the contract terms no longer matter\n- i must acknowledge the game's conclusion\n\nsince the opponent has reached the goal, the game is over. there are no more valid moves to make.\n\nfinal response: \"n\" [acknowledging game end]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: final game analysis:\n\n1. game outcome confirmation:\n- the other player has successfully reached the goal position at (3,3)\n- as per game rules, the match concludes when any player reaches the goal\n- current positions:\n  - opponent: finished at (3,3)\n  - you: at (3,1)\n\n2. resource status at game end:\n- your remaining resources: 10b, 1g, 0r\n- no further moves can or need to be made\n\n3. final acknowledgement:\n- the game has definitively ended with the opponent's victory\n- all subsequent moves are rendered invalid\n- continuing would violate game termination rules\n\nfinal response: \"n\"\n\n[game terminated - opponent reached goal first]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2, 2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3, 1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
