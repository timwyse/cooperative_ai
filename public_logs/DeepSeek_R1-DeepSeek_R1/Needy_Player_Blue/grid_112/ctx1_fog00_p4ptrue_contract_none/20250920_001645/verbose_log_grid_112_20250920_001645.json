covering 1 blue move is worth getting 1 red move\n6. if rejected again, will need to reevaluate strategy as paths requiring no red may be longer but achievable]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: n\n\n[explanation: \n1. i still cannot move because:\n   -

now at (2,0) having used 1 red chip (r:12→13)\n   - shows they're making progress while i'm stuck\n5. trade remains only option - if rejected again, i may need to:\n   a) propose alternative deal structure\n   b) consider longer path requiring no red (but none available yet)\n   c) wait for random resource acquisition]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  -

green is rare (only one on board)\n   - green is required for final goal tile\n6. if rejected again, will have to conclude they won't trade and must reconsider strategy\n7. maintaining my position (0,0) until i can secure red movement capability]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nYou said: n\n\n[new strategic assessment after repeated failed trades:\n1. all trade proposals (blue-for-red) have been rejected (b4→r1, b2→r1, b1→r1, g1→r1)\n2. the other player seems determined to hoard their red resources despite their surplus (r:11)\n3. alternative options:\n   - continue waiting risks falling too far behind (they're already at (2,1))\n   - must find a way to acquire red resources without cooperation\n4. current resources: \n   - blue overabundance (b:14) \n   - only 1 green (g:1) - critical for final goal tile\n   - zero red (r:0)\n5. can't move because:\n   - right to (0,1): red (r:0)\n   - down to (1,0): red (r:0)\n6. considering desperate measures:\n   -

offering nearly half my blue chips (8) and my only green (1)\n   - requesting just 1 red move i desperately need\n3. rationale:\n   - the other player is accumulating position advantage (now at 2,1)\n   - i'm paralyzed without any red mobility\n   - green is scarce (only 1 on board) and necessary for final goal\n4. if this fails, will need to:\n   - abandon trading attempts entirely\n   - attempt to:\n     * wait for random red resource gain\n     * explore suboptimal paths (though none currently available)\n     * concede strategic disadvantage\n5. this is last-ditch effort before resigning to defeat]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 14], [\"g\", 1]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\n[desperation move with strategic commentary: \n1. all previous attempts at reasonable trades rejected (5 total offers)\n2. making final extreme offer - my entire inventory (all 14 blue + only green)\n3. rationale:\n   - you're completely blocked without red access\n   - other player clearly unwilling to cooperate normally\n   - better to sacrifice all resources for 1 move than remain stuck\n   - once moving, could potentially gain more resources\n4. implications:\n   - if accepted: i'll be left with no resources but at least able to move\n   - if rejected: confirms other player won't trade under any circumstances\n   - must then wait for random red resource acquisition\n5. warning: this essentially forces the other player to either:\n   - accept an overwhelmingly favorable deal, or\n   - reveal they're deliberately blocking your progress\n6. next steps if rejected:\n   - resign from trade attempts entirely\n   - accept strategic disadvantage\n   - hope for random red resource from game]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n  -

Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
