You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 0: let's analyze this carefully:\n\n1. there's a misunderstanding in your counter - you think i have 14 blues, but actually:\n   - my resources: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14} (i have zero blues)\n   - your resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\n2. therefore:\n   - i physically cannot give you any blues (since i have 0)\n   - your initial assessment that you have all the blues is correct\n\n3. revised fair proposal:\nsince i need 5 reds (which you can provide)\nyou need 4 blues (which only you can provide, since i have none)\n\nbut since only you can provide both:\nwe need an asymmetric deal where you help me with reds, and i help you... but i have nothing you need.\n\nbest solution:\ni can offer my only green in exchange for your red support, even if you don't need it, as goodwill.\n\nfinal offer:\n- (1,0): you give me r\n- (2,0): you give me r\n- (2,1): you give me r \n- (3,1): you give me r\n- (3,2): you give me r\n- (0,0): i give you g (my starting tile)\n- (no blue exchanges since i can't provide)\n\nthis way:\n- you spend 5r, keep 9r\n- you gain 1g (even if not needed)\n- i get to goal while keeping my remaining 9r\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: let me re-analyze the situation with the correct resource counts:\n\n1. you're right, i misread the resource distribution. the correct state is:\n   - you: {'b':0, 'g':1, 'r':14} \n   - me: {'b':14, 'g':1, 'r':0}\n\n2. given this:\n   - for my path (all blue tiles): i need to pay 4b total (already have 14b)\n   - for your path: you need to pay 5r total (have 14r available)\n   - no overlap in resource needs\n\n3. your offer is interesting - getting a green i don't need in exchange for 5 reds:\n\nfinal counter-proposal to make it balanced:\n- (1,0): i give you r\n- (2,0): i give you r \n- (2,1): i give you r\n- (3,1): i give you r\n- (3,2): i give you r\n- (0,0): you give me g (even though i don't need it, as goodwill)\n\nthis way:\n- i spend 5r (have 9r remaining)\n- you spend nothing (since you can't actually provide any resources i need)\n- you get to goal with your remaining 9r (since you pay 5r)\n\neven though not perfectly balanced (since i'm providing more), i'll accept this to move forward.\n\nagree \n",
