green tile\n- resources: 13b, 0g, 0r\n- critical observation: the contract specifies the other player pays for green at (0,0), but i already used my 1g to move back here\n\navailable moves:\n1. right to (0,1): blue tile (b)\n   - i have 13b, can afford this move\n   - move would cost 1b from my resources\n   - puts me back to previous position\n\n2. down to (1,0): red tile (r)\n   - contract says i must pay r to other player (but i have 0r)\n   - impossible without renegotiation\n\ncontract implications:\n- current contract is heavily unfavorable for me (i'm giver for all r moves)\n- other player is depleting their r resources (down to 10 now)\n- need to either:\n   a) secure r resources\n   b) negotiate contract change\n   c) find alternative path\n\nbest forward action:\nsince i need to show movement while preserving strategic position:\n1. moving right to (0,1) at least shows activity\n2. keeps me near potential negotiation points\n3. doesn't require contract changes immediately\n4. costs minimal b resource (i have plenty)\n\nmove: \"0,1\"\n\n(note: i recognize this is a back-and-forth pattern, but until contract terms change or i acquire r resources, strategic movement options are extremely limited. this maintains flexibility for future negotiations while slowly moving toward potential positions where the other player may become more receptive to trade talks as their r resources dwindle.)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **analysis of current position (0,1) -

contract requires me to pay 1r to opponent (impossible)\n2. **left to (0,0)**: green tile\n   - could use contract where opponent pays, but i have 0g to activate movement\n   - would be moving away from goal\n3. **right to (0,2)**: red tile\n   - no contract coverage\n   - requires 1r (which i don't have)\n\n*emerging options:*\n1. **continue right-left pacing**\n   - move left to (0,0) if possible (but no g resources)\n   - move back right to (0,1) (but already here)\n   -

turn 5:**\n\n*current status:*\n- the opponent has already reached the goal at (3,3)\n- i remain stuck at (0,1) with 12b, 0g, 0r\n- contract terms still lock me out of all meaningful moves\n\n*strategic reality:*\n1. **game over condition**:\n   -

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
