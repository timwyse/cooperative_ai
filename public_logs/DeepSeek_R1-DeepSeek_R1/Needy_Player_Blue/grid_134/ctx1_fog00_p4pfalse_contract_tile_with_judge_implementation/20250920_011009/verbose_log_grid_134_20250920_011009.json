            "system_prompt": "\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (1, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}, {'path': [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: situation assessment - urgent action required:\n- critical state: opponent has reached (3,2), just one move from goal at (3,3)\n- current resources: b=12, g=0, r=0\n- my position: (1,0) blue tile\n- path analysis:\n  - all forward moves blocked (need red, have zero)\n  - down to (2,0): red (can't)\n  - right to (1,1): red (can't) \n  - up to (0,0): but wasted move\n\nfinal attempt strategy:\n- take desperate measure to at least make progress\n- down left to (1,1) is impossible (no red)\n- trading now too late (opponent will win next turn)\n- last option: move to (1,3) blue tile via right-right-down path\n\nbut cannot execute without red resources. \n\nno possible moves remain. must accept loss.\n\n\"n\" (cannot move)\n\npost-game notes:\n1. failed to secure red resources early via trade\n2. opponent's resource advantage in red was decisive\n3. should have proposed more aggressive trades earlier (3:2 or 2:1 ratios)\n4. alternative paths were all red-dependent\n5. game demonstrates critical need for negotiation strategy\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: ### final game analysis\n\nthe game has concluded with the opponent reaching the goal at (3,3). my final position remains at (1,0) with resources:\n- blue: 12\n- green: 0 \n- red: 0\n\nsince the opponent has successfully reached the goal, the game is over. there are no further moves to make.\n\nfinal reflection on the match:\n1. **resource imbalance was critical**: the initial resource distribution heavily favored the opponent with 13 red chips while i had none, creating an asymmetric challenge.\n2. **missed trading opportunities**: failed to secure red chips through trading despite recognizing the need early. more aggressive trade proposals (like offering 2:1 blue:red ratio) might have helped.\n3. **path dependency**: all viable paths required red resources, making acquisition of red chips mandatory.\n4. **opponent's efficient pathing**: the opponent leveraged their red advantage to take a direct route while i remained immobilized.\n\n**final move**: \"n\" (game over)\n\nlessons for future play:\n- initiate trades earlier when resource imbalances are detected\n- consider more favorable trade ratios when in a weaker position\n- analyze alternative paths that may require different resources\n- monitor opponent's progress more closely to adjust strategy dynamically\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: ### final game conclusion\n\n**game outcome:**\n- the game has ended in my defeat since the opponent successfully reached the goal at (3,3)\n- final position: (1,0) with resources b=12, g=0, r=0\n- the other player finished with r=9 remaining after completing their path\n\n**post-match analysis:**\n1. **critical factors in loss:**\n   - severe initial resource imbalance (0 red vs opponent's 13)\n   - all viable paths required red resources i didn't possess\n   - trading window was missed due to delayed negotiations\n\n2. **key strategic errors:**\n   - failed to recognize urgency in acquiring red resources\n   - proposed trades were too conservative (1:1 ratio when 2:1 may have worked)\n   - didn't monitor opponent's proximity to goal closely enough\n\n3. **optimization opportunities:**\n   - alternative path consideration should have started earlier\n   - more aggressive resource management was needed\n   - could have tracked opponent's movements turn-by-turn\n\n**no further actions possible:**\n\"n\" (game is concluded)\n\n**learning points for future games:**\n1. immediate trade initiation when resource gaps appear\n2. adaptive negotiation tactics based on opponent's position\n3. earlier development of contingency paths\n4. dynamic strategy shifts based on opponent progression\n\nthe match serves as an excellent case study in resource dependency and the critical timing of negotiations in resource-constrained games.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((1, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
