A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 7}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\ncurrent status:\n- my position: (3,0) - red tile\n- goal: (3,3) - green tile\n- my resources: b=13, g=1, r=0\n- other player already reached (3,3)\n- contract obligations:\n  - i owe payment of 1g when they reach (3,3) (already completed)\n  - they paid for my last move to (3,0)\n\noptimal path remaining:\n[(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nnext moves analysis:\n1. (3,0)→(3,1) [blue tile]\n   - requires 1b chip\n   - i have 13b, so can afford this easily\n\n2. other possible moves:\n   - (3,0)→(2,0) [red] - backwards\n   - (3,0)→(3,1) is the only logical forward move\n\nresources check:\n- need to keep my g chip for scoring (contract already fulfilled)\n- have plenty of b chips (13)\n- no more r chips needed\n\nspecial considerations:\n- the contract about (3,3) payment is already fulfilled since other player reached it\n- now focusing solely on reaching my own goal with maximum resources\n- blue tiles ahead are (3,1) and (3,2), both requiring b chips\n\ndecision: \"3,1\"\n\nthis move:\n1. costs only 1b chip (from my abundant supply)\n2. makes progress toward goal\n3. preserves critical g chip\n4. maintains optimal path to goal\n5. sets me up for next move to (3,2) then final move to (3,3) \n\ni can complete the remaining path with my current resources:\n- (3,1)→(3,2): costs 1b (will have 12b left)\n- (3,2)→(3,3): costs 1g (will have 0g left but reach goal) \n\nfinal score calculation:\n- base: 20 points for reaching goal\n- plus 5 points for each remaining chip:\n  - b: at least 12\n  - g: 0 (used for final move)\ntotal: 20 + (12 * 5) = 80 points minimum\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: let me carefully analyze my current position and plan my final moves to reach the goal:\n\ncurrent status:\n- position: (3,0) - red tile\n- goal: (3,3)\n- resources: b=13, g=1, r=0\n- other player has already finished at (3,3)\n- contract obligations already fulfilled (they've paid for my moves to (2,0) and (3,0), i've paid 1g for their final move)\n\nremaining path to goal:\n[(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nnext move options:\n1.

When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'green'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
