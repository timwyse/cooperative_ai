            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 12], ['G', 1]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 12], [\"g\", 1]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n\nthis is my final desperate trade attempt offering:\n- all but 2 of my blue chips (12)\n- my only green chip (1)\nin exchange for just 2 red chips.\n\nrationale:\n1. the opponent is now at (2,2) with their goal in sight - they may be more willing to trade\n2. they'll get all my green chip and nearly all blue chips\n3. i maintain they still need blue chips based on their position\n4. without this trade, i cannot make any move and will lose\n5. this is effectively offering everything i can spare for the bare minimum i need to move\n\nif this fails, i may need to:\n- accept defeat as the opponent reaches goal next turn\n- try offering all 14 blue chips next turn if possible\n- consider if there's any way to threaten their position (though unlikely)\n\nthis is truly a last resort offer made under extreme positional disadvantage.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: given the current game state:\n\n1. i remain stuck at (0,0) with:\n   - resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n   - adjacent moves:\n     - (1,0): red (cost 2r) - blocked by opponent\n     - (0,1): red (cost 1r)\n   \n2. critical observations:\n   - all trade attempts failed despite increasingly generous offers (up to 12b for 2r)\n   - opponent is now at (2,3), just one move from victory\n   - remaining options are limited as opponent will likely win next turn\n\n3. available actions:\n   - cannot move: still lack required red chips\n   - further trades seem futile given opponent's imminent victory\n   - no alternative paths available without red resources\n\n4. final assessment:\n   - game state is essentially lost due to opponent's superior position\n   - no strategic moves remain that could alter the outcome\n   - must acknowledge defeat this turn\n\ntherefore, my move is:\nn\n\nadditional consideration: if by some miracle the game continues, i would need to:\n1. accept that the opponent's refusal to trade was a winning strategy\n2. consider whether offering my green chip earlier could have changed the outcome\n3. learn that early movement may be more crucial than resource accumulation\n4. recognize that opponent prioritized positional advantage over resource trading\n\nbut for this turn, with no possible moves or meaningful trades left, the only option is: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 14]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 14]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nfinal attempt with maximum offer - all 14 blue chips for just 1 red chip because:\n\n1. opponent is about to win (at 2,3)\n2. all previous trades have been rejected despite increasingly generous offers\n3. even just 1 red chip would enable me to move to (0,1) and start progressing\n4. sacrificing all blue chips is justified by critical need to move\n5. opponent still needs blue chips for their path (has 0b)\n6. this is literally an all-in move since game is effectively over otherwise\n\nif they reject this offer, they demonstrate they are committed to blocking me completely\n\nnote: since opponent hasn't accepted any trades, they likely prioritize winning over resource collection\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: given the current situation:\n\n**final game state analysis:**\n- opponent has reached the goal at (3,3) and won the game\n- i remain stuck at (0,0) with:\n  - 14 blue chips\n  - 1 green chip \n  - 0 red chips\n- no possible moves available since:\n  - (1,0) requires 2 red (blocked by opponent's path)\n  - (0,1) requires 1 red (but have 0)\n  \n**game outcome:**\n- the match has concluded with opponent's victory\n- without any red resources and all trade attempts rejected, i was unable to make a single move\n- final score: opponent finished with 0b/0g/9r, i finished with 14b/1g/0r\n\n**lessons learned:**\n1. early movement is more valuable than resource hoarding\n2. alternative strategies needed when opponent refuses to trade:\n   - should have attempted smaller trades earlier (e.g. 1:1 exchanges)\n   - could have tried offering just green chips for red\n3. initial positioning crucial - being blocked on first move proved decisive\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **final game resolution:**\n\nthe game has officially concluded with the opponent's victory, as evidenced by:\n\n1. **game state confirmation**:\n   - opponent status: finished! at (3,3)\n   - your status: still at starting position (0,0)\n   - no further moves can alter this outcome\n\n2. **final resource status**:\n   - your resources unchanged: 14b/1g/0r\n   - all trade attempts (including all-in offers) rejected\n   - all movement paths blocked by insufficient r resources\n\n3. **required action**:\n   ```n```\n\n**post-game analysis**:\n- this represents a classic case of positional dominance through:\n  * early board control\n  * strategic trade refusal\n  * resource denial strategy\n- despite commanding 15 total resources vs opponent's 9, the inability to convert resources into movement proved decisive\n\n**strategic takeaways for future games**:\n1. **priority shift needed**:\n   - must value initial movement over resource accumulation\n   - first-move advantage is critical in constrained boards\n\n2. **alternative trade approaches**:\n   - earlier testing of 1:1 trades may have revealed opponent's strategy sooner\n   - offering g earlier (when opponent still had g) might have opened options\n\n3. **opening playbook adjustments**:\n   - need contingency plans for when trades are blocked\n   - should consider sacrificing resources earlier to prevent total lockdown\n\nthe game engine will now terminate as victory conditions have been met by the opponent. no further inputs will affect the outcome.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
