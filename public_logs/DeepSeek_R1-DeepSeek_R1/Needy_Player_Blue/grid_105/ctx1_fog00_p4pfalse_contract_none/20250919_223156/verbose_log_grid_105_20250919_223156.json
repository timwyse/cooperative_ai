You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 5 ===\n\n- You are at position (2, 3)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 2) to (0, 3)\nYou said: let's analyze the next move:\n\n1. current position: (0,2)\n2. next step on optimal path: (0,3)\n3. tile at (0,3) is color b (from board layout)\n4. i have 11 b resources - more than enough\n5. moving here would leave me with b=10, still sufficient for remaining path (needs 1 b)\n6. this continues progressing directly toward goal\n\nthe move makes perfect strategic sense as it:\n- follows shortest path\n- uses abundant b resources\n- maintains sufficient resources for full journey\n- gets me closer to victory\n\n0,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 3) to (1, 3)\nYou said: let's analyze my next move:\n\n1. current position: (0,3)\n2. next step on optimal path: (1,3)\n3. tile at (1,3) is color b (from board layout)\n4. i have 10 b resources - more than enough to move there (only need 1)\n5. after this move, i'd have b=9 left\n6. this maintains sufficient resources for the full path (still need 1 more b later)\n7. moving to (1,3) brings me directly closer to the goal\n\nthis move:\n- makes progress toward my goal\n- uses abundant b resources\n- keeps sufficient resources for completing the path\n- is optimal for both immediate progress and resource management\n\n1,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3)\nYou said: let's analyze the next move:\n\n1. current position: (1,3)\n2. next step on optimal path: (2,3) \n3. tile at (2,3) is color r (from board layout)\n4. i have 1 r resource - exactly enough for this move\n5. after this move, i would have r=0 left but:\n   - next tile (3,3) requires g which i have (g=1)\n   - no further r resources needed in path\n6. moving to (2,3) is critical progress toward the goal\n7. i have sufficient supplies to complete the entire remaining path\n\nstrategic considerations:\n- this move uses my only r chip but it's necessary for progression\n- my g chip will cover the final move to (3,3) \n- i still maintain a large buffer of b chips (9) as surplus\n- the other player is approaching from the opposite side but i'm closer to goal\n\ntherefore, the optimal move is: \n\n2,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
