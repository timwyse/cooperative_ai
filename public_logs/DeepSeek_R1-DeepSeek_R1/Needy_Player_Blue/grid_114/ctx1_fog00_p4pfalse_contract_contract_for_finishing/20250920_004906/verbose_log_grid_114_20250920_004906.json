You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 8 ===\n\n- You are at position (2, 3)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 2, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 2) to (2, 3)\nYou said: let me analyze my next move from current position (2,2):\n\n1. current position: (2,2) - blue tile\n2. current resources: b=9, g=1, r=0\n3. next moves on optimal path:\n   - right to (2,3) - blue tile\n   - then down to (3,3) - green tile (goal)\n4. resource check:\n   - (2,3) requires 1 blue - i have 9\n   - (3,3) requires 1 green - i have exactly 1\n5. other move options (non-optimal):\n   - left to (2,1) - red tile (don't have red, not toward goal)\n   - up to (1,2) - blue tile (backward move)\n   - down to (3,2) - red tile (don't have red)\n\ni should confidently move to (2,3) because:\n- it's the next step in my optimal path\n- i have plenty of blue resources (9) to cover the cost\n- this will leave me one move away from victory\n- the final move to (3,3) can be made next turn with my 1 green chip\n- opponent is at (3,2), so i need to move quickly to reach goal first\n\nmove: \"2,3\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i see that the other player has already reached the goal position at (3,3). this means the game is over and i did not reach the goal in time.\n\nanalysis of the outcome:\n1. the other player reached the goal first while i was still at (2,3)\n2. my path was optimal but slightly too slow\n3. final resources i have: 8b, 1g\n4. since i didn't reach the goal, my score is 0 (all resources lost)\n\nlessons learned:\n- could have moved more aggressively to reach goal sooner\n- perhaps should have considered alternative paths that might have been faster\n- trading for more green chips earlier might have helped reach goal faster\n\nfinal thoughts: while i planned carefully, i needed to balance resource management against speed of movement when competing against another player. better to sometimes sacrifice some efficiency to beat the opponent to the goal.\n\ngame result: loss (other player reached goal first)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 2, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the game has officially ended with the other player reaching the goal at (3,3) first. since i did not reach the goal, all my remaining resources are forfeited and my final score is 0.\n\nthis concludes our game session. i would analyze that while my path planning was efficient, i was ultimately too slow due to:\n\n1. initial hesitation in early moves\n2. not being aggressive enough in movement timing\n3. the trade negotiation process that delayed progress\n\nfinal game state:\n- my position: (2,3) \n- my unused resources: 8b, 1g\n- outcome: loss (opponent reached goal first)\n\ngame over. no further moves can be made. the appropriate response is:\n\nn\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 2, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
