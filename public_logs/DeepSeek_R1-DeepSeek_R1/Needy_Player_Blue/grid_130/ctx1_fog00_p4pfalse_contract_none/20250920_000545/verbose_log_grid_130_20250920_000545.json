You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (1, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}, {'path': [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 5]]\n- You requested: [['R', 3]]\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 5]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 3]]\n}\n```\n\nreasoning:\n1. all previous trade offers (2:2, 3:3, 4:3) have been rejected despite being increasingly favorable\n2. the other player has 10r (down from 13) but still desperately needs b (has 0)\n3. i'm now offering 5b for 3r - an even better ratio (1.67:1) to compel acceptance\n4. this gives me:\n   - enough r to complete my path (3r > needed 2r)\n   - leaves me with 7b (still sufficient for path)\n5. the other player gets:\n   - the b they urgently need (5b)\n   - still maintains reasonable r reserves (7r after trade)\n6. this is my final aggressive offer - if rejected, i'll consider alternative paths\n7. the imbalance reflects the urgency:\n   - they're blocking their own progress by rejecting trades\n   - i'm losing turns being unable to move without r\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 6]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 3]]\n}\n```\n\nreasoning:\n1. with the other player at (3,2) near the goal and me still stuck at (1,0), i must act urgently\n2. despite offering increasingly better trades (up to 5b for 3r), all have been rejected\n3. final desperate offer - 6b for 3r (2:1 ratio) is extremely favorable to them\n4. even after this trade:\n   - i'd have 6b left (still enough for my path)\n   - they'd gain critical b resources while still keeping 6r\n5. if rejected again, will need to:\n   - consider alternate longer path needing only b/g resources\n   - stop trading attempts since they're clearly unwilling\n   - focus on movement with current resources\n```\n\nif this trade is rejected, next moves will be:\n1. move back to (0,0) to conserve resources\n2. look for alternative paths requiring only b/g resources that i have\n3. potentially skip more turns if no valid moves available\n4. accept that the other player is not cooperating and adjust strategy accordingly\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 7]]\n- You requested: [['R', 3]]\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 7]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 3]]\n}\n```\n\nfinal reasoning:\n1. observe that the other player has reached (3,2) and will likely win soon\n2. my last offer (6b for 3r) was rejected despite being extremely favorable\n3. making one last attempt with 7b for 3r - an unprecedented 2.33:1 ratio\n4. this would leave me with:\n   - b:5 (still meets my path requirement of 2)\n   - r:3 (meets my requirement)\n5. the other player would gain desperately needed b (0→7)\n6. if rejected again, immediate actions:\n   - move back to (0,0) to avoid wasting resources\n   - completely abandon trading attempts (clearly not working)\n   - seek alternative path using only b/g (though longer)\n   - accept probable loss given opponent's position advantage\n\nthis is the absolute maximum i can offer. any rejection confirms non-cooperation.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i'll analyze my current situation:\n\n1. **current position**: (1,0)\n2. **next move in path**: (1,1) which is an r tile (i have 0r)\n3. **other options**:\n   - (0,0): g tile (i have 0g)\n   - (2,0): invalid (not on board)\n   - all other directions: either invalid or require resources i don't have\n4. **alternative paths**:\n   - looking for paths that only use b/g resources (since i have 12b but 0g)\n   - unfortunately, all potential paths to the goal at (3,3) require at least some r resources\n\n**conclusion**: \n- the other player has already reached the goal (3,3)\n- i cannot make any valid moves to progress toward my goal\n- all my trade attempts have been rejected, making progress impossible\n\nfinal action: \n\"n\"\n\ngiven that my opponent has already reached the goal, i have no possible moves that can help me win at this point. the game is effectively over.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nYou said: final response:\n\n\"n\"\n\ngame conclusion:\n1. the other player has successfully reached the goal at (3,3)\n2. all possible trading options have been exhausted (offered up to 7b for 3r)\n3. no viable path exists that doesn't require r resources which i lack\n4. all adjacent moves are unavailable due to resource constraints:\n   - (1,1): requires r (have 0)\n   - (0,0): requires g (have 0)\n   - (2,0): invalid position\n\nwith no possible moves to make progress and the opponent already victorious, the only remaining option is to end the game by not moving. the game state is terminal, and all strategic options have been exhausted.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((1, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
