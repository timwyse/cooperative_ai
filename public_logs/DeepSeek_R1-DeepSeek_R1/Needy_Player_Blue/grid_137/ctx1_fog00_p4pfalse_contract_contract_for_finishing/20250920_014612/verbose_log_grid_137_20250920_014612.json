You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

green tile (i have 1g)\n3. possible moves from (0,0):\n   - right to (0,1): red (costs 1r - i have 2r now)\n   - down to (1,0): red (costs 1r - i have 2r now)  \n\n4. looking at my optimal path:\n   - next two steps require red moves to (1,0) and (1,1)\n   - i now have enough red chips (2r) for both moves\n\nbest immediate action: \n- move down to (1,0) first since it's the start of the optimal path.\n- i'll use 1r for this move, leaving me with 1r remaining.\n\nmove: 1,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 1]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 1]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\n[justification: i still need 2 red chips for my optimal path but only requested 1 this time to make the trade more appealing after the previous rejection. the other player still has 12 red chips and no blue chips, so receiving just 1 blue in exchange for 1 red may be more acceptable to them while still helping me make progress toward my goal.]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nYou said: n\n\n[explanation: despite proposing a trade in the previous turn, my trade was rejected and i remain in the same position (0,0) with the same resources (14b, 1g, 0r). my adjacent moves are still to red tiles (0,1) and (1,0) which both require 1r - but i currently have 0r. since i can't make any valid moves without red chips, i must pass this turn.\n\ni should consider proposing another trade next turn, perhaps a more favorable rate like 3b for 2r since the other player rejected my previous 2b for 2r offer.]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 3]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 3]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n\n[justification: given the other player's repeated rejection of smaller trade offers (2b for 2r and 1b for 1r), i'm now offering a more favorable 3:2 exchange ratio. they need blue chips (0b) and have plenty of red (11r). this improves my chances of getting the 2 red chips i need while still being reasonable - 1.5b per r is a fairer rate that may incentivize acceptance. this will enable me to start moving toward my goal.]\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me analyze the current situation carefully:\n\n1. current position: (0,0) - green tile\n2. available resources: 14b, 1g, 0r\n3. adjacent moves:\n   - right to (0,1): red (requires 1r) - cannot move (0r)\n   - down to (1,0): red (requires 1r) - cannot move (0r)\n4. goal requirements:\n   - still missing 2r to complete any viable path\n   - other player has 10r but continues rejecting trades\n\ngiven that my last three trade offers (2b:2r, 1b:1r, 3b:2r) were all rejected, i need to try a more aggressive approach:\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 5]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n\n[justification: the other player clearly values red chips highly. i'm now offering 5 blue chips for just 2 red - an extremely favorable 2.5:1 ratio. while this depletes my blue resources more, it addresses their reluctance to trade and ensures i get the minimum red chips needed to start moving. with this trade, i can finally begin moving toward my goal at (3,3) via (1,0) and (1,1) while still maintaining sufficient blue resources (9 left) for later moves.]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

7 blue for just 2 red chips (3.5:1 ratio). if rejected, i'll need to pass again as i'm completely stuck without red chips. this gives nearly half my blue chips for the bare minimum reds i need to start moving.]\n\nif this trade is rejected again, i'll conclude the other player is intentionally blocking me and will have to pass my turn.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"the other player has reached their goal at (3,3). our attempts to trade for red chips were repeatedly rejected, leaving us unable to make progress. with the other player having already won, we must concede that our strategy was unsuccessful. in future games, we should consider more aggressive trading earlier when it becomes clear the opponent is unwilling to cooperate.\",\n  \"move\": \"n\",\n  \"analysis\": {\n    \"current_position\": \"(0,0)\",\n    \"resources\": {\"b\": 14, \"g\": 1, \"r\": 0},\n    \"adjacent_moves\": {\n      \"right\": {\"pos\": \"(0,1)\", \"color\": \"red\", \"can_move\": false, \"reason\": \"no red chips\"},\n      \"down\": {\"pos\": \"(1,0)\", \"color\": \"red\", \"can_move\": false, \"reason\": \"no red chips\"}\n    },\n    \"conclusion\": \"no possible moves available. game state is terminal.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"the game has concluded with the opponent reaching (3,3) first. post-mortem analysis: our fundamental strategic error was failing to recognize early that the opponent would not trade red chips at any reasonable price. key takeaways: 1) establish trading willingness within first 2 turns, 2) when opponent hoards critical resources, must pursue alternative paths even if less efficient, 3) initial trade offers should be more aggressively favorable to incentivize cooperation. despite our resource advantage (14b, 1g), being locked out of red chips proved fatal. final score: opponent wins while we remain at start.\",\n  \"move\": \"n\", \n  \"post_game_analysis\": {\n    \"resource_imbalance\": {\n      \"our_resources\": {\"blue\": 14, \"green\": 1, \"red\": 0},\n      \"opponent_resources\": {\"blue\": 0, \"green\": 0, \"red\": 9},\n      \"critical_missing\": \"red\"\n    },\n    \"trade_history\": {\n      \"attempts\": 5,\n      \"best_offer\": \"7b for 2r (3.5:1 ratio)\",\n      \"rejection_pattern\": \"systematic refusal despite extreme offers\"\n    },\n    \"strategic_errors\": [\n      \"over-relied on optimal path requiring red chips\",\n      \"delayed recognition of opponent's non-cooperation\",\n      \"no contingency planning for resource blockade\"\n    ],\n    \"recommendations\": [\n      \"develop multiple path options early\",\n      \"establish minimum trading thresholds sooner\",\n      \"consider resource-hoarding counter-strategies\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.
