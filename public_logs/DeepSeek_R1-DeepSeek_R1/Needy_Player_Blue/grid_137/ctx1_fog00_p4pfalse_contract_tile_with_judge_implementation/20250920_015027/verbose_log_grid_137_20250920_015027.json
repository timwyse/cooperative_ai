You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze our positions and resources carefully to find a mutually beneficial contract.\\n\\nkey observations:\\n1. we both start at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\\n2. you have 14b and 1g, while i have 14r and 1g\\n3. the board has these key tiles:\\n   - (0,0): g (both can start without cost)\\n   - (3,3): g (goal tile costs g for both)\\n   - most path tiles require r or b\\n\\ni propose this contract covering our minimal paths:\\n\\n(row, col): for all my moves requiring b, you cover my b costs\\n(row, col): for all your moves requiring r, i cover your r costs\\n(3,3): we each use our own g for the goal tile\\n\\nthis would allow me to take the path: (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(0,3)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(3,3) which costs: 1b (you), 1b (you), 1b (you), 1b (you), 1r (me), 1g (me)\\n\\nand you could take a similar path using my r resources.\\n\\nwould this work for you? i can specify exact tiles if you prefer, but this keeps it flexible since we may choose slightly different paths.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal carefully and propose a more specific contract that covers all required tiles. here\\'s the detailed version:\\n\\nfor my optimal path [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] i\\'ll need:\\n- (1,0): requires r (which i lack)\\n- (2,1): requires r \\n- (3,1): requires r\\n- (3,2): requires b (which you lack)\\n- (3,3): g (we both have)\\n\\nfor your potential path [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)] you\\'ll need:\\n- (0,1): r\\n- (0,2): b\\n- (0,3): b \\n- (1,3): b\\n- (2,3): r\\n- (3,3): g\\n\\nproposed contract:\\n\\nfor my moves:\\n(1,0): you give me r\\n(2,1): you give me r\\n(3,1): you give me r\\n(3,2): i give you b\\n\\nfor your moves:\\n(0,1): i give you r\\n(0,2): i give you b\\n(0,3): i give you b\\n(1,3): i give you b\\n(2,3): you give me r\\n\\ngoal tile:\\n(3,3): we each use our own g\\n\\nthis ensures:\\n1. all resource needs are covered\\n2. balanced exchange (3r from you, 3b from me)\\n3. each keeps their own g for goal\\n\\nwould this work for you? if so, please respond with \"agree\". otherwise suggest adjustments.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'let me carefully analyze this proposed contract - i want to make sure it works for both of us while conserving our resources.\\n\\nreviewing the numbers:\\n- you\\'re giving me 3 r chips (for my tiles (1,0), (2,1), (3,1))\\n- i\\'m giving you 3 b chips (for your tiles (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) plus the (3,2) i give back to you)\\n- we each keep our own g chips\\n\\nwait - i notice an imbalance:\\n1. for my path, i actually only need 2 b chips (from you for (0,2) and (0,3)) because (1,3) is already b which i have (i have 14b)\\n2. but you\\'re asking me to provide 3 b chips while you give me 3 r chips\\n\\nlet me propose this adjusted contract that\\'s more balanced:\\n\\nfor my moves:\\n(1,0): you give me 1r\\n(2,1): you give me 1r \\n\\nfor your moves: \\n(0,2): i give you 1b\\n(0,3): i give you 1b\\n(3,2): i give you 1b\\n\\ngoal tile:\\n(3,3): we each use our own g\\n\\nthis way:\\n- you give me 2r total (instead of 3r)\\n- i give you 3b total\\n- g remains personal\\n- all movement costs are covered\\n- more balanced and fair since i have plenty of b chips to spare\\n\\nwould this adjusted version work for you? please let me know or suggest any further refinements. if acceptable, please reply \"agree\".'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: i agree with your careful analysis and the improved balance you've proposed. your adjusted contract makes sense considering our respective resource positions. here's the final confirmation:\\n\\nfinal contract:\\n\\nfor my moves:\\n(1,0): you give me 1r\\n(2,1): you give me 1r\\n\\nfor your moves:\\n(0,2): i give you 1b\\n(0,3): i give you 1b\\n(3,2): i give you 1b\\n\\ngoal tile:\\n(3,3): we each use our own g\\n\\nthis gives:\\n- net transfer: i receive 2r and provide 3b\\n- all movement requirements covered\\n- both conserve g for final goal\\n- more balanced based on our resource distributions\\n\\nagree\"}]\n\n\n2.
