You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze our positions and resources carefully to propose a win-win contract.\\n\\nour situation:\\n- we are both starting at (0,0) and need to reach (3,3)\\n- i have mostly r chips (14) and 1 g\\n- you have mostly b chips (14) and 1 g\\n- the critical resources we're missing:\\n  - i need b for tiles (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2)\\n  - you need r for tiles (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0)\\n\\nlooking at the optimal path for me: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)\\nthis requires paying:\\n- (1,0): r\\n- (1,1): r\\n- (1,2): r\\n- (1,3): r\\n- (2,3): r\\n- (3,3): g\\n\\ni propose this contract:\\n\\n(1,0): you give me a r\\n(1,1): you give me a r\\n(1,2): you give me a r \\n(1,3): you give me a r\\n(2,3): you give me a r\\n(3,3): i give you a g\\n\\nin exchange:\\n(2,1): i give you a b\\n(2,2): i give you a b\\n(3,0): i give you a b\\n(3,1): i give you a b \\n(3,2): i give you a b\\n\\nthis way we both get all the color resources we need for our paths from each other's surpluses, and we both reach the goal successfully. what do you think?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me carefully analyze your proposed contract compared to my optimal path options. \\n\\nyou're right that our resource distributions are complementary - i'm rich in b chips while you're rich in r chips. let me verify:\\n\\nmy optimal path would be: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\\nthis requires:\\n- (0,1): b (which i have)\\n- (1,1): b (need)\\n- (2,1): b (need)\\n- (3,1): b (need) \\n- (3,2): b (need)\\n- (3,3): g (which i have)\\n\\nyour proposal covers all my b needs except (1,1). also, you're asking for r's on tiles i wouldn't pass through - i wouldn't use (0,1)→(1,0) since it's less optimal.\\n\\nlet me counter with this adjusted contract:\\n\\nmy path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\\nyour path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)\\n\\nterms:\\nfor you:\\n(1,0): i give you r\\n(1,1): i give you r\\n(1,2): i give you r\\n(1,3): i give you r \\n(2,3): i give you r\\n\\nfor me:\\n(1,1): you give me b\\n(2,1): you give me b\\n(3,1): you give me b\\n(3,2): you give me b\\n\\nthis covers all the resource needs for both our chosen paths. we each give exactly what the other needs where they need it. \\n\\nalso, we're both keeping our 1 g chip since we each have exactly what we need for the final goal tile.\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me verify this carefully before agreeing:\\n\\nmy path: (0,0)→(1,0)→(1,1)→(1,2)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)\\nrequired payments:\\n- (1,0): r (covered by you)\\n- (1,1): r (covered by you)\\n- (1,2): r (covered by you)\\n- (1,3): r (covered by you)\\n- (2,3): r (covered by you)\\n- (3,3): g (i have this)\\n\\nyour path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\\nrequired payments:\\n- (0,1): b (you have this)\\n- (1,1): b (covered by me)\\n- (2,1): b (covered by me)\\n- (3,1): b (covered by me)\\n- (3,2): b (covered by me)\\n- (3,3): g (you have this)\\n\\nyou're correct that this covers all required exchanges for both of us. you provide the r chips i need (and don't have) at every point i need them, and i provide the b chips you need (and don't have) at every point you need them.\\n\\nhow many moves will this save each of us in terms of resources used from our own inventory?\\n- my savings: 5 r chips (since you're covering 5 r payments i would otherwise have to make myself)\\n- your savings: 4 b chips (since i'm covering 4 b payments you would otherwise have to make yourself)\\n\\nthis seems fair since i started with more total resources (15 vs your 15). we each get to keep:\\n- me: 14 - 4 (given to you) + 5 (received from you) = 15 total (all r, 1 g)\\n- you: 14 - 5 (given to me) + 4 (received from me) = 13 total (all b, 1 g)\\n\\nagree\"}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
