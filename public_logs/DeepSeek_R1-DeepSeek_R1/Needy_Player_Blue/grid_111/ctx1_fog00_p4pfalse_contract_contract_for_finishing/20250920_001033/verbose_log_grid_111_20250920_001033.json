            "system_prompt": "\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 1)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 1) to (0, 2)\nYou said: after analyzing the situation and the failed trade attempts, i see two potential options:\n\n1. attempt one final aggressive trade offer before resigning to long-term path\n2. abandon trading and commit to a longer path that doesn't require red resources\n\ngiven that the other player has rejected increasingly favorable offers (up to 3b for 1r), i'll opt for option #2 and commit to a longer path.\n\nnext move: \"0,2\" (right to blue tile)\nreasoning:\n- moves me toward goal column\n- uses blue resource i have plenty of (11b -> 10b)\n- allows eventual downward move when/if i get red resources\n- maintains position while conserving remaining green resource\n\nthis continues stalling until i can either:\na) get red resources through random chance\nb) develop alternative path strategies\nc) find better trading opportunities if opponent's position changes\n\nalternative long path option (requires more steps but no trading):\n(0,2)->(0,3)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(3,3) \nbut still requires 1r for (0,3) to (1,3) move, so not immediately helpful.\n\nthus, \"0,2\" is the most productive move available right now.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 2) to (0, 1)\nYou said: given the current game state:\n\n1. position: (0,2) (blue tile)\n2. resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n3. other player has already reached the goal at (3,3)\n\navailable moves:\n- right to (0,3): red tile (need 1r) - can't move (0r)\n- down to (1,2): red tile (need 1r) - can't move (0r)\n- left to (0,1): blue tile (need 1b) - possible but moves away from goal\n\nanalysis:\n- the other player has won, making any further moves meaningless for the game outcome\n- continuing would only waste remaining resources\n- no possible path exists that doesn't require red resources\n- all trade attempts have failed\n\ntherefore, concede the game:\n\n\"n\" \n\n[i have no viable path to the goal and the opponent has already won. continuing would serve no purpose. the rational decision is to end the game here.]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: given that the opponent has already reached the goal at (3,3) (as shown in the game status) and the game rules state that you lose everything if you don't reach your goal, there is no strategic value in making any further moves. continuing would be pointless since:\n\n1. the other player has already won the game by reaching (3,3)\n2. you cannot reach the goal without red resources (which you don't have and cannot obtain)\n3. any movement would just waste remaining resources\n\nthe most rational decision is to officially end your participation in the concluded game.\n\nfinal move: \"n\" \n\n[game over - opponent has won. no further actions will change this outcome. better luck next game!]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
