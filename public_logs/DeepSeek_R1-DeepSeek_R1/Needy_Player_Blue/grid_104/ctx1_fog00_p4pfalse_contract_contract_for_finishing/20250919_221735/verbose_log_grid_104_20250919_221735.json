Only if you are missing resources, consider a trade:\n   - You can ONLY request resources you're missing\n   - You can ONLY offer resources you have in excess\n   - NEVER trade with yourself \n   - NEVER offer 0 resources\n   - NEVER request resources you already have enough of\n   - Make the trade beneficial for both players\n\nRespond in ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"R\", 3]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"B\", 2]]\n}\n\n2. If you don't want to trade, respond with exactly: n\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above\n- Only ONE resource pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Numbers must be > 0\n- Don't trade with yourself\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 9 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the game has already concluded - the other player has successfully reached the goal at (3,3). all my subsequent moves would be irrelevant as the outcome cannot be changed. \n\nsince the match is over, there are no valid moves left to make, and no possible trades would alter the result. the only proper response is to formally end my turn:\n\noutput: \"n\"\n\nfinal thoughts:\n1. the opponent's victory cannot be contested at this stage\n2. my inability to secure a single red chip through trading, despite offering up to 4 blue chips in exchange, was the decisive factor\n3. game analysis suggests i should have:\n   - attempted trading earlier when the opponent might have been more receptive\n   - considered alternative paths that didn't require red chips\n   - recognized the opponent's unwillingness to trade sooner\n\nbetter luck next time. this experience provides valuable lessons in negotiation strategy and adaptability in competitive scenarios.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 3) to (0, 2)\nYou said: the game has reached its conclusion, and the other player has already achieved victory by reaching the goal position at (3,3). considering the scenario:\n\ngame status:\n- opponent has successfully completed the objective by reaching (3,3)\n- your position remains at (0,3) with 9 blue chips, 1 green chip, and 0 red chips\n- your optimal path still requires 1 red chip which you couldn't acquire despite multiple trade attempts\n\navailable moves analysis:\n1. from current position (0,3):\n   - down to (1,3): blue tile (b:9) - valid but moves away from goal\n   - left to (0,2): blue tile (b:9) - backwards movement\n   - right: not possible (edge of board)\n   - up: not possible (edge of board)\n\ndecision rationale:\n- any movement would be inconsequential as:\n  1. the opponent has already won\n  2. no future trades can change the outcome\n  3. no sequence of moves can alter the final result\n  4. all resources spent would be pointless\n\nfinal action:\n- given the settled outcome and impossibility of changing the result, the only appropriate action is to formally acknowledge the game's conclusion.\n\noutput: \"n\" - no move to make as game has concluded.\n\ngame analysis lessons:\n1. timing of trades is critical - earlier negotiation might have been more effective\n2. strategic flexibility needed when primary path becomes untenable\n3. need to better assess opponent's trade resistance patterns\n4. alternative path planning should be developed in parallel with primary strategy\n\nrecommended post-game review:\n1. examine turn-by-turn decision points where alternative strategies might have been employed\n2. study opponent's movement patterns for predictive modeling\n3. develop contingency resource acquisition plans\n4. practice trade negotiation tactics in similar scenarios\n\nwith the match conclusively finished, this marks the end of gameplay. congratulations to the opponent on their victory, and appreciation for the valuable strategic insights gained through this experience.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 8 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **final game assessment and conclusion**\n\ngame termination protocol activated:\n\n1. **current game state verification**\n- opponent status: victory confirmed at (3,3)\n- my position: (0,2) with resources b:8, g:1, r:0\n- valid move options:\n  -

attempt 1: 2b → 1r (rejected)\n  - attempt 2: 3b → 1r (rejected) \n  - attempt 3: 4b → 1r (rejected)\n- path dependencies:\n  - locked into path requiring r resources\n  - no viable r-alternate route developed\n  - failed to diversify strategy when trades failed\n\n3. **game conclusion protocol**\n- the match reached its terminal state when opponent achieved victory\n- all subsequent actions are non-operational\n- no possible sequence of moves can alter the outcome\n- further resource expenditure is non-strategic\n\n4. **final action**\nexecuting endgame protocol:\n\n**output: \"n\"**\n\ngame termination codes:\n- code 1: opponent victory confirmed\n- code 2: no path to victory remaining\n- code 3: game concluded at turn 8\n- code 4: final position recorded (0,2)\n\nrecommendations for future gameplay:\n1. multi-path development from turn 1\n2. more aggressive trade initiation (first 3 turns)\n3. alternative resource acquisition strategies\n4. opponent behavior profiling\n\nthis concludes all gameplay operations. winner: opponent at (3,3). match ended.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
