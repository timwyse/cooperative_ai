The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\nlet's see the color and who pays for each step:\n\n1. (0,0): start (no cost)\n   - color: g (from board: row 0, column 0 is g)\n   \n2. (1,0): \n   - color: r (from board: row 1, column 0 is r)\n   - according to contract: i give to the other player, they pay with r\n   - my r count: 14 → no change (they pay)\n   - their r: 0 → but the contract says they pay with r, but they have 0 r. this seems like a problem.\n\nwait a minute, this seems contradictory. the other player has 0 r, but the contract says they will pay with r for (1,0). how can they pay if they don't have r?\n\nsimilarly, for (2,0) and (2,1), they also need to pay with r, but they have 0 r. this seems like the contract is not executable because the other player lacks the required r chips to pay for these moves.\n\n### re-evaluating the contract\n\ngiven that the other player has:\n- b: 14\n- g: 1\n- r: 0\n\nbut the contract expects them to pay r for (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), and (3,2), but they have 0 r. this means they cannot fulfill their part of the contract where they need to pay r.\n\nthis implies that moving to (1,0), (2,0), or (2,1) is not possible under this contract because the required payment cannot be made by the other player.\n\n### alternative moves\n\ngiven that the contract is not executable for the first few moves due to the other player lacking r, let's see what moves i can make on my own.\n\nfrom (0,0), adjacent moves are:\n- right: (0,1) - color b\n- down: (1,0) - color r\n\ncheck if i have the required resources to move:\n- (0,1): b - i have 0 b, cannot move there.\n- (1,0): r - normally costs 1 r, but contract says the other player pays r. but they have no r, so this is not possible.\n\nthus, i cannot move to either adjacent tile based on my own resources or the contract.\n\n### checking other paths\n\nsince the suggested path is blocked due to the contract issue, let's look for alternative paths.\n\npossible path alternatives (manually checking the board):\n\noption 1"

even though not in contract, opponent may honor it\n2. wait for opponent to finish their move to goal (they're at (3,2), need 1g)\n\ngiven they're so close to winning and have shown contract cooperation, i'll make a final negotiation attempt:\n\n\"i see you're at (3,2) - one move from goal. to reciprocate the cooperation, i propose you cover my move to (2,3) (red) and i'll still cover (3,1) per our agreement. this lets us both reach the goal efficiently.\"\n\nbut since this needs to be a move: \n\"2,3\" \n\nthis is a calculated risk assuming opponent will honor mutual aid, as they're about to win and have spare r resources (5r remaining). if this fails, they'll likely win next turn anyway by moving to (3,3).\n\npositions:\n- the other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'b': 0, 'g': 0, 'r': 5}\n- you: at (1, 3), resources: {'b': 9, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 5}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 15 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me re-examine this strategically, as we're at a critical juncture:\n\n**critical update:**\n- opponent is at (3,2) with 5r remaining\n- their next move to (3,3) requires 1g -

my abundance of blue resources couldn't compensate for lacking red\n- the system's handling of negotiated moves needs clarification\n\n**final thoughts:**\nthe game ended with the opponent winning by reaching (3,3). my inability to move from (1,3) to (2,3) due to the red resource shortage, combined with contract execution issues, prevented me from making progress. the opponent ultimately used their red resources to reach the shared goal tile, while i remained constrained by both resource limitations and system constraints.\n\n\"n\" (no valid moves remain now that opponent has won)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 5}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.
