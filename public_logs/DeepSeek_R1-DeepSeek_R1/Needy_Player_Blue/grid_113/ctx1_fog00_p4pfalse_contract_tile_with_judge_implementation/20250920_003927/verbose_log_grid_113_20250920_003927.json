You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(1,2) - blue (b) - backtracks, doesn't help\n2. (2,1) - red (r) - need 1r, which i don't have\n3. (2,3) - red (r) - need 1r, which i don't have\n4. (3,2) - red (r) - optimal path but i lack the resource\n\nalthough i don't have red chips, our contract doesn't cover (3,2). there are two options:\n1. try to negotiate an amendment to the contract to include (3,2)\n2. wait and see what the opponent does (but risks them winning first)\n\nsince we can't communicate right now for a contract amendment, and i can't make any valid move toward the goal, i must output \"n\" this turn. \n\nthe optimal play would be:\n1. next turn, if still my turn, attempt to trade for red chips if possible\n2. if opponent reaches goal first, the game ends\n\nmove: \"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou said: the game has ended! the other player has reached the goal position at (3,3), which means:\n\n1. the game is now over since the other player reached the goal first.\n2. since i didn't reach my goal at (3,3), i lose all my remaining resources and score 0 points.\n3. my final position is (2,2) with resources: {'b': 10, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n4. the other player wins with their 20 base points plus 5 points per remaining chip.\n\nkey observations:\n- the opponent beat me to the goal by moving to (3,3) before i could get there\n- our contract didn't cover the critical (3,2) move i needed\n- with my lack of red chips and no contract coverage for (3,2), i was unable to progress\n\nkey learnings for next time:\n1. ensure contract covers all critical path tiles where i lack resources\n2. consider alternative paths earlier in the game\n3. monitor opponent's position more closely to anticipate moves\n\nfinal situation:\n- game result: defeat (other player reached goal first)\n- final score: 0 points (since i didn't reach goal)\n- resources lost: 10b, 1g, 0r\n\nthe optimal strategy would have been to negotiate contract terms that included the (3,2) red tile earlier in the game, or find a path that didn't require red chips. but given the actual gameplay, this was the inevitable outcome.\n\n[game over]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nYou said: **game over - final result**\n\nthe other player has already reached the goal position at (3,3), ending the game. since i didn't reach my goal:\n\n- my final position remains at (2,2)\n- final resources: {'b': 10, 'g': 1, 'r': 0} (all lost since goal wasn't reached)\n- final score: 0 points\n- outcome: defeat - opponent reached goal first\n\nkey post-game analysis:\n1. strategic error: the contract failed to cover the critical (3,2) red tile, which became our path's bottleneck\n2. resource mismatch: our abundant blue chips (10 remaining) were useless for the final red tile\n3. timing issue: the opponent's red-heavy inventory gave them a natural advantage on the board layout\n\nlessons for future games:\n1. contract coverage must include all resource-deficient tiles in planned path\n2. alternative paths without red requirements should have been considered earlier\n3. more aggressive movement when opponent is close to goal\n4. earlier negotiation for red chip trades given our initial resource imbalance\n\n[game officially concluded - no further moves possible]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.
