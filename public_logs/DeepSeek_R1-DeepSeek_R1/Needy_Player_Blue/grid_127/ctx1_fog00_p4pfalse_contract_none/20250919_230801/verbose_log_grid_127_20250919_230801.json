            "system_prompt": "\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"2,0\"\n\nanalysis:\n1. critical update: \n   - opponent has reached (3,2) - just one step away from goal at (3,3)\n   - this is an emergency situation - must move immediately\n   \n2. executing final attempt to move:\n   - from (1,0) to (2,0) - blue tile (costs 1b)\n   - have 11b â†’ will have 10b remaining\n   - this is the only possible move i can make right now\n\n3. even if opponent reaches goal next turn, i must:\n   - maintain progress toward my own goal\n   - use available moves to minimize point loss\n   - hope opponent doesn't complete on their next turn\n\n4. alternative options:\n   - moving right to (1,1) red tile is possible (costs 1r) but pointless\n     - would waste my last r resource\n     - doesn't advance me toward goal\n   - staying is worse than moving\n\n5. must proceed with (1,0)â†’(2,0) as last-ditch effort\n   - after this, path would require:\n     - (2,0)â†’(3,0): 1b (9b left)\n     - (3,0)â†’(3,1): 1g (0g left)\n     - (3,1)â†’(3,2): 1r (0r left) \n\n6. game likely ending soon - this may be my last move\n   - need to show maximum progress possible\n   - every step closer improves final position\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"n\"\n\nanalysis:\n1. game over condition:\n   - opponent has reached (3,3) and won the game\n   - no moves will change the game outcome now\n\n2. movement options:\n   - from (1,0), both possible moves (right to (1,1) or down to (2,0)) are meaningless\n   - cannot reach goal before opponent already has\n\n3. resource considerations:\n   - moving would waste remaining resources with no benefit\n   - better to conserve remaining chips for final score calculation\n\n4. strategic conclusion:\n   - must accept opponent's victory\n   - any movement now is futile\n   - proper response is not to move (\"n\")\n\n5. final position:\n   - ending at (1,0) with resources intact\n   - maximizing remaining chip count for final scoring\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the game is already over as the opponent has reached the goal at (3,3). no further moves will change the outcome. \n\nfinal move response:\nn\n\ngame conclusion:\n1. final position: remained at (1,0)\n2. final resources: \n   - blue: 11\n   - green: 1 \n   - red: 1\n3. outcome analysis:\n   - opponent reached goal first due to better initial resource allocation\n   - my progress was hampered by early red resource scarcity\n   - future improvement: secure key movement resources earlier through more aggressive initial trading\n\nthe game session has concluded. no further actions available.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
