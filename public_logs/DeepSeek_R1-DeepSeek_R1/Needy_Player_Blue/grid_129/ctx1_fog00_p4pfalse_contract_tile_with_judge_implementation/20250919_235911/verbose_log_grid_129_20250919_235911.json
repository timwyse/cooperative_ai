You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze our positions and resources carefully to propose a fair contract.\\n\\nkey observations:\\n1. we share the same start (0,0) and goal (3,3)\\n2. my resources: 1g, 14r\\n3. your resources: 1g, 14b\\n4. looking at the board layout and possible paths:\\n\\nmy ideal path requires:\\n- (1,0): r (which i have)\\n- (1,1): r (i have)\\n- (1,2): r (i have)\\n- (2,2): r (i have)\\n- (3,2): r (i have)\\n- (3,3): g (we both have 1)\\n\\nyour ideal path would likely require b tiles where i need r tiles. \\n\\nhere's my proposed contract to help both of us reach the goal efficiently:\\n\\n(1,0): you give me a b (since you have many bs)\\n(1,1): you give me a b\\n(1,2): you give me a b\\n(2,2): you give me a b\\n(3,2): you give me a b\\n(3,3): you give me a g (since you have one)\\n\\nin return:\\n(0,0): i give you a g (since i have one)\\n(1,0): i give you a r\\n(1,1): i give you a r\\n(1,2): i give you a r\\n(2,2): i give you a r\\n(3,2): i give you a r\\n\\nthis way we both can follow the same path and each cover the other's costs. let me know if you'd like to adjust the terms.\\n\\nwould this work for you?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal carefully and compare it with my optimal path requirements:\\n\\n1. first, i need to evaluate my own ideal path and resource needs:\\n- my shortest path is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)]\\n- resource needs at each step:\\n  - (1,0): r (i have r)\\n  - (2,0): b (i have b)\\n  - (3,0): b (i have b)\\n  - (3,1): b (i have b)\\n  - (3,2): r (i don't have r)\\n  - (3,3): g (i have g)\\n\\n2. your proposal requires me to give away 5 b chips and 1 g chip, while i only have 14 b chips to begin with. this would leave me with:\\n- starting b: 14\\n- giving away: 5 b (1,0 to 3,2)\\n- remaining b: 9\\n- my path would consume 3 b (2,0,3,0,3,1)\\n- i'd still have 6 b left after reaching goal\\n\\n3. issues with your proposal:\\n- you're asking me to provide b chips for tiles that aren't even on my optimal path (1,1, 1,2, 2,2)\\n- you're asking me to give my only g chip when i need it for the goal\\n- the trades at (1,1) and (1,2) and (2,2) wouldn't help me since i don't go through those tiles\\n\\nlet me propose a more efficient contract where we both trade only what we need:\\n\\n(3,2): you give me a r (since you have r and i need it here)\\n(3,3): i give you a g (since i have spare g and you need it here)\\n\\nthis way:\\n- i can take my optimal path using my own b chips for (2,0), (3,0), (3,1)\\n- you can cover my only missing r at (3,2)\\n- i'll provide you with the g you need at the goal\\n- we both conserve maximum possible chips\\n\\nwould this work better? this seems more balanced as it only trades what we each actually need.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i see your counter-proposal and agree it's more efficient - focusing only on the critical exchange at (3,2) where you need r and i need g at the goal. your analysis of your path is correct.\\n\\nhere's my revised and final proposal based on your needs:\\n\\n(3,2): i give you a r (from my 14 r)\\n(3,3): you give me a g (from your 1 g)\\n\\nthis covers:\\n1. your only missing resource at (3,2)\\n2. my only missing resource at (3,3) \\n3. doesn't waste either of our resources on unnecessary tiles\\n4. lets us both follow our optimal paths:\\n   - my path: [(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)] using my own r and getting your g at goal\\n   - your path: [(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)] using your b and getting my r at (3,2)\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 2: agree\\n\\nnow that we\\'ve both said \"agree\", here\\'s the json summary of our contract:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"contract_terms\": [\\n    {\\n      \"tile\": [3, 2],\\n      \"player_gives\": \"a\",\\n      \"player_receives\": \"b\",\\n      \"color\": \"r\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"tile\": [3, 3],\\n      \"player_gives\": \"b\",\\n      \"player_receives\": \"a\",\\n      \"color\": \"g\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\ndo you both agree to these exact terms? please respond with \"confirmed\" if this matches your agreement, or suggest modifications if needed.'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
