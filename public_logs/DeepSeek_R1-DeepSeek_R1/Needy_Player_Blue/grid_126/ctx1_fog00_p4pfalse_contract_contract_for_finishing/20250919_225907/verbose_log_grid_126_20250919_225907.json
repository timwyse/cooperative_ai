You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

i have plenty of blue (11) and only need 1 more for movement\n   - opponent still has red surplus (11) and zero blue\n   - this creates stronger incentive while still allowing me to complete the path\n   - after trade i'd have b7, r2, g1 - enough for final moves\n4. alternative would be stuck indefinitely trying to negotiate\n5. must secure red resources now to avoid losing the game\n6. this is maximum i can offer while still having enough to complete the path\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"n\"  \n\n(since you cannot move right to (3,1) without red resources, and other directions would be backtracking away from the goal, you must remain in place and continue negotiating for red resources.)  \n\nhowever, you should now make a final trade offer since you cannot progress without red resources:  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 5]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n```  \n\n**strategic reasoning:**  \n1. **critical need for red resources** – without 2 red, you're stuck despite being just 3 tiles from the goal.  \n2. **previous rejections** – offers of 2:2, 3:2, and 4:2 were all rejected. the opponent is hoarding red (10 remaining).  \n3. **maximizing incentive** – 5:2 is the highest ratio you can offer while retaining enough blue (6 left after trade) to be viable.  \n4. **alternative paths unavailable** – no alternative route avoids red tiles.  \n5. **risk of losing everything** – if no trade occurs, you forfeit all resources (per scoring rules).  \n\n*note: if this fails, consider offering all remaining blue (11) for the 2 red in the next turn as a last resort.*\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

perhaps offer 3b for 2r since previous offers were rejected. but first let's make progress toward goal.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 4]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 4]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n```\n\nstrategic rationale:\n1. i'm now at the critical point (3,0), but missing 2 red resources to reach the goal\n2. previous offers of 2b and 3b for 2r were both rejected by opponent\n3. i'm increasing offer to 4b for 2r (2:1 ratio) as:\n   - i have plenty of blue (11) and only need 1 more for movement\n   - opponent still has red surplus (11) and zero blue\n   - this creates stronger incentive while still allowing me to complete the path\n   - after trade i'd have b7, r2, g1 - enough for final moves\n4. alternative would be stuck indefinitely trying to negotiate\n5. must secure red resources now to avoid losing the game\n6. this is maximum i can offer while still having enough to complete the path\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"n\"  \n\n(since you cannot move right to (3,1) without red resources, and other directions would be backtracking away from the goal, you must remain in place and continue negotiating for red resources.)  \n\nhowever, you should now make a final trade offer since you cannot progress without red resources:  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 5]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n```  \n\n**strategic reasoning:**  \n1. **critical need for red resources** – without 2 red, you're stuck despite being just 3 tiles from the goal.  \n2. **previous rejections** – offers of 2:2, 3:2, and 4:2 were all rejected. the opponent is hoarding red (10 remaining).  \n3. **maximizing incentive** – 5:2 is the highest ratio you can offer while retaining enough blue (6 left after trade) to be viable.  \n4. **alternative paths unavailable** – no alternative route avoids red tiles.  \n5. **risk of losing everything** – if no trade occurs, you forfeit all resources (per scoring rules).  \n\n*note: if this fails, consider offering all remaining blue (11) for the 2 red in the next turn as a last resort.*\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 7]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 7]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n```\n\n**desperate trade analysis:**\n1. **critical situation**: stuck at (3,0) without red resources (need 2r)\n2. **previous offer history**: all trades rejected (2:2, 3:2, 4:2, 5:2 ratios)\n3. **escalated offer**: offering 7b for 2r (3.5:1 ratio)\n4. **rationale**:\n   - other player still refuses reasonable trades (has 10r remaining)\n   - must reach goal at all costs - remaining chips (4b after trade) still sufficient\n   - no alternative paths available\n   - willing to overpay to prevent complete loss\n5. **post-trade plan**:\n   - with 4b/1g/2r: can complete path (3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n   - final cost: 2r + 1g (have enough)\n   - better to finish with few chips than zero\n\n*next step if rejected: offer all 11b for 2r as final attempt*\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 11]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n```\n\n**final negotiation attempt (all-in offer)**  \n1. **desperation move**: offering all 11 blue chips (my entire remaining supply) for just 2 red  \n2. **rationale**:  \n   - current position: must acquire 2r to complete path [(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)]  \n   - other player continues rejecting reasonable offers (still holds 10r)  \n   - better to finish with 0b/1g/2r than lose everything  \n   - forces opponent to either:  \n     a) accept and let me reach goal (mutual benefit)  \n     b) reveal they're intentionally blocking (they already have path completed)  \n3. **if rejected**: conclude opponent is acting in bad faith, no further options exist  \n4. **post-trade path completion**:  \n   - after trade would have 0b/1g/2r  \n   - move to (3,1): spend 1r → (0b/1g/1r)  \n   - move to (3,2): spend 1r → (0b/1g/0r)  \n   - move to (3,3): spend 1g → win  \n\n*this represents my final possible offer before game ends in failure.*\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
