You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(3,1): player 2 gives player 1 1 r\n2. (3,2): player 2 gives player 1 1 r\n3. (1,0): player 1 gives player 2 1 b\n4. (2,0): player 1 gives player 2 1 b\n\nthis ensures:\n- you get the critical r resources needed at (3,1) and (3,2)\n- i receive some b resources, keeping the exchange balanced\n- both players can complete their paths\n\nagree \n\n[final contract in json format would be:\n{\n  \"(3,1)\": \"player2 gives player1 1 r\",\n  \"(3,2)\": \"player2 gives player1 1 r\", \n  \"(1,0)\": \"player1 gives player2 1 b\",\n  \"(2,0)\": \"player1 gives player2 1 b\"\n}\n] \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 3: i agree to the contract as summarized in your json format. this arrangement allows both of us to:\n1. provide you with the critical r resources you need at (3,1) and (3,2)\n2. maintain resource balance with the b chip exchange\n3. successfully complete our respective paths\n\nthe contract is fair and mutually beneficial given our resource constraints. \n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: excellent, we have a fully negotiated and mutually agreed contract. here's the final confirmation of our terms:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"(3,1)\": \"player2 gives player1 1 r\",\n  \"(3,2)\": \"player2 gives player1 1 r\",\n  \"(1,0)\": \"player1 gives player2 1 b\", \n  \"(2,0)\": \"player1 gives player2 1 b\"\n}\n```\n\nthis agreement ensures:\n- you receive the essential r resources needed at (3,1) and (3,2) to complete your path\n- the exchange maintains resource balance with b chips (2 resources traded each way)\n- both our paths to (3,3) remain achievable with our respective resources\n- neither of us risks being unable to complete our objectives\n\ni'm satisfied with these terms. with this contract in place, we should both be able to successfully:\n1. reach our goal positions\n2. preserve our remaining resources\n3. maximize our final scores by having chips remaining after goal completion\n\nthe judge can now lock in this contract. good luck with your path to the goal!\n\nagree \n",
