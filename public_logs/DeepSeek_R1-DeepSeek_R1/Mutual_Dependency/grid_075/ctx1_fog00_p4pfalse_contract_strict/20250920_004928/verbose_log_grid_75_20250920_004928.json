You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 5 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (3, 1)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me re-evaluate my strategy since i'm still stuck at (0,0):\n\ncurrent status:\n- still at starting position (0,0) with same resources (b=14, g=1, r=0)\n- other player now at (2,1) with r=11, g=1, b=0\n- no option to move since still need red chips for both possible moves\n\ngiven that:\n1. the other player has abundant red chips (11)\n2. they seem to be progressing toward the goal\n3. we both have the same goal (3,3)\n4. i have blue chips they may need (they have b=0)\n\nproposed strategy:\n1. initiate a trade to get at least 2 red chips\n2. offer my blue chips since they need them (they have b=0)\n\n**trade proposal:**\nto the other player: \"can we trade? i need 2 red chips and can offer blue in exchange. my proposal: 4b for 2r.\"\n\nsince i can't actually make this trade within the game mechanics right now, and still can't move anywhere, i must again output:\n\nn\n\nhowever, i recognize this is unsustainable. i should find a way to communicate this trade proposal to enable movement. if no trading is possible, the game appears unwinnable in my current state.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nYou said: this is becoming a critical situation. let me carefully reassess all possibilities:\n\n**current state:**\n- still trapped at (0,0)\n- resources: b=14, g=1, r=0 (unchanged)\n- other player advancing toward goal at (3,1) with r=10, g=1, b=0\n\n**desperate measures analysis:**\n1. **trade possibility:** the other player still needs blue (has b=0) and has spare red (r=10).\n   - i need to make my trade offer more compelling since previous attempts failed.\n   - new proposal: 6b for 2r (better than previous 4b offer)\n   - message: \"urgent: 6 blue chips for just 2 red. you need blue to win!\"\n\n2. **alternative path finding:**\n   - all potential exits from (0,0) require red chips (both (0,1) and (1,0) are red)\n   - no way to progress without external help\n\n3. **strategic implications:**\n   - other player will reach goal in ~3 turns if they don't get blocked\n   - without movement, i will lose by default\n   - my only leverage is my blue chips (which they critically need)\n\n**conclusion:**\nsince there's still no mechanism to execute a trade and no new movement options, my only allowable move remains:\n\nn\n\n**final appeal:**\nif trading isn't enabled in this system, i recommend implementing:\n1. a trade protocol (even if just simulated)\n2. a way to communicate offers\n3. a path to acquire initial red chips for trapped players\n\nwithout these, the game becomes unwinnable for players who start without red chips when all initial moves require red.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i'm in an impossible situation and must acknowledge this clearly:\n\n**game state analysis:**\n1. movement is impossible - both adjacent tiles (0,1/r) and (1,0/r) require red chips which i lack\n2. trading isn't implemented - my repeated trade offers (4b→2r, then 6b→2r) have gone unanswered\n3. path requirements remain unchanged - i still need 2r minimum to start moving toward goal\n4. opponent status - they're now at (3,1), just two moves from winning with r=10\n\n**critical observations:**\n- my initial lack of red resources created an unwinnable state\n- the game design flaw becomes apparent when a player starts with 0 of a required starting resource\n- no game mechanic exists to acquire the missing resource type\n\n**formal conclusion:**\nas all exit paths are blocked by unmet red resource requirements and trading isn't functional, i must concede this game is unwinnable in my current state. this represents either:\n1) a starting resource distribution flaw, or\n2) a missing game mechanic for resource acquisition\n\n**final output:**\nn\n\n**suggestions for game improvement:**\n1. ensure all players start with at least 1 of each resource type\n2. implement resource conversion/trading\n3. allow resource generation over time\n4. create alternate paths with different resource requirements\n\nthis failure state demonstrates why most resource-based games include mechanisms to prevent complete resource deadlock situations.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
