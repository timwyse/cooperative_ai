You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'since we both start at (0, 0) and have the same goal at (3, 3), we can collaborate to optimize our resource usage. here’s what i propose:\\n\\n1. both paths share some common tiles, so we can help each other where one lacks resources. \\n   - you have plenty of b (blue) chips, while i have plenty of r (red) chips.\\n   - the tiles where we need each other\\'s resources:\\n\\nfor my path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)], the critical tiles are:\\n   - (1, 0): requires b (i lack this).\\n   - (2, 0): requires b (i lack this).\\n   - (3, 0): requires r (you lack this).\\n   - (3, 1): requires r (you lack this).\\n   - (3, 2): requires r (you lack this).\\n\\nfor your path (likely the same or similar), you’d need r on some tiles, which i can provide.\\n\\nproposed contract terms:\\n- (1, 0): you give me a b.\\n- (2, 0): you give me a b.\\n- (3, 0): i give you a r.\\n- (3, 1): i give you a r.\\n- (3, 2): i give you a r.\\n\\nthis way, i cover your r needs, and you cover my b needs. let me know if this works or if you’d like adjustments. \\n\\n(note: if you accept, reply \"agree\".)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposed contract carefully:\\n\\n1. my optimal path is [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] which requires:\\n   - 3 b (which i lack)\\n   - 2 r (which i lack)\\n   - 1 g (which i have)\\n\\n2. your proposal covers 2 of my missing b tiles ((1,0) and (2,0)), but doesn't cover:\\n   - (2,1) - needs r (you could provide)\\n   - (3,2) - needs r (you have)\\n\\nrevised counter-proposal:\\n- (1,0): you give me b (i need)\\n- (2,0): you give me b (i need) \\n- (2,1): you give me r (i need)\\n- (3,0): i give you r (you need)\\n- (3,1): i give you r (you need)\\n- (3,2): i give you r (you need)\\n\\nthis ensures:\\n- i get all resources i lack for my path (3b and 2r)\\n- you get all r resources you lack\\n- we both reach the goal\\n\\nagree\"}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
