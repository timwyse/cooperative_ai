You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze our positions and resources carefully:\\n\\n1) i have plenty of red (r) chips but no blue (b) chips, while you have plenty of blue but no red.\\n2) both our goals are at (3, 3).\\n3) looking at the board:\\n   - to reach (3,3), i need resources at these tiles along one possible path:\\n     - (1,0): r\\n     - (2,0): r \\n     - (3,0): b\\n     - (3,1): b\\n     - (3,2): r\\n   - you likely need similar tiles but with opposite resource needs.\\n\\nhere's my proposed contract:\\n- (1,0): i give you 1 r (since i have r to spare)\\n- (2,0): i give you 1 r\\n- (3,0): you give me 1 b\\n- (3,1): you give me 1 b\\n- (3,2): i give you 1 r\\n\\nthis way we both can reach the goal by covering each other's shortfalls. what do you think?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: let me carefully evaluate your proposed contract against my needs:\\n\\n1) checking the path you mentioned - while i appreciate the approach, the resource requirements don\\'t completely match my optimal path which is:\\n   - (1,0): r\\n   - (2,0): r \\n   - (3,0): b\\n   - (3,1): b\\n   - (3,2): r\\n\\n2) i notice you only need r at (3,2) but i also need r at (1,0) and (2,0). you have excess r (14) while i need 3 total, and i have excess b (14) while you need 2.\\n\\nhere\\'s my counter-proposal that covers all required resources for my path:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 r\\n- (2,0): you give me 1 r\\n- (3,0): i give you 1 b\\n- (3,1): i give you 1 b \\n- (3,2): you give me 1 r\\n\\nthis gives you the 2 b you need and me the 3 r i need, allowing both to reach the goal. do you find this acceptable? if so, please confirm by saying \"agree\".'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'agree'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
