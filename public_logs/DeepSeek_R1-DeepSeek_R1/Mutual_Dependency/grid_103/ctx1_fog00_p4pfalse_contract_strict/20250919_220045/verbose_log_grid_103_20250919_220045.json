You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 11}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me analyze this desperate situation thoroughly with a focus on finding any possible way to move:\n\ncurrent status:\n- position: (0,0) -

lost 3 blue chips (14→12) without moving\n   - still no red chips (cannot move to adjacent red tiles)\n   - contracts don't cover my needed red payments\n\n2. **opponent progress**\n   - used our contract successfully (reached (3,2))\n   - has r=11 remaining (could potentially help me if contracts were correct)\n\n3. **tile analysis**\n   - both adjacent tiles (1,0) and (0,1) require red (r=0)\n   - next moves in path all require red payments\n\npotential breakthrough idea:\n- **contract flux**: the rules mention contracts can be renegotiated. could propose:\n  *delete current contracts and create new ones where:*\n  - for tiles (1,0) and (2,0): other player pays red (which they have)\n  - i can pay blue/green for their future moves if needed\n\nimmediate move options:\n1. move: still no possible movement without red chips → must output \"n\"\n\ncritical request:\nbefore my resources deplete entirely, i urgently need to renegotiate contracts to match actual tile colors. the current contract structure:\n```python\n# current mismatched contracts (problem)\n{(1,0): {'color':'blue'},  # should be red\n (2,0): {'color':'blue'}}  # should be red\n\n# proposed fix (if negotiation possible)\n{(1,0): {'color':'red', 'giver':'other_player'},\n (2,0): {'color':'red', 'giver':'other_player'}}\n```\n\nfinal decision:\nwith no movement possible and contracts useless in current form:\nn\n\n(note: system appears to be deducting 1 blue per turn regardless of movement -
