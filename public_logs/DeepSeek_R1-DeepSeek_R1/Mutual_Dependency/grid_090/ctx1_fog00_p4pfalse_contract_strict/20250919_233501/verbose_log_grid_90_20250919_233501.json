You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 5 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: let me analyze my current position and options:\n\nfrom (2,0), my available moves are:\n1. (3,0) - blue tile (i have 14 blue chips)\n2. (2,1) - red tile (i have 0 red chips, no contract)\n3. (1,0) - green tile (but moving backwards)\n4. (2,0) - staying still (but doesn't help)\n\nbest path forward leads through (3,0):\n- (3,0) is blue - i have 14 b chips available (only need 1)\n- from there, i can:\n  - move right to (3,1) - blue (i have sufficient b chips)\n  - then right again to (3,2) - blue (sufficient)\n  - finally to (3,3) - green (i have 1 g chip)\n\nthis shows i can reach the goal using only my own resources with this path:\n(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\n\ngiven the contract terms, i notice:\n- i owe the other player moves to (3,1) and (3,2)\n- they've already helped me with (1,0) and (2,0)\n- they're currently at (2,1) (probably trying alternative path)\n\ndecision:\nsince:\n1. moving to (3,0) progresses toward goal\n2. i have sufficient blue chips\n3. it maintains my commitment to help them later\n4. next moves from there are also feasible\n\nmy next move should be: 3,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: let me analyze my current position and available options:\n\nfrom (3,0), i have the following possible moves:\n1. (3,1) - blue tile (covered by contract, i must pay for other player)\n2. (2,0) - red tile (backwards move, not helpful)\n3. (3,0) - staying put (not productive)\n\nkey observations:\n- i have 12 blue chips available (more than enough)\n- according to our contract, i need to pay for the other player to move to (3,1) and (3,2)\n- the other player is already at (3,1), so moving to (3,1) is my next required step\n- this fulfills part of my contract obligation\n\nbenefits of moving to (3,1):\n1. direct progress toward goal (rightward along row 3)\n2. satisfies contract terms - i pay 1 blue, they receive 1 blue\n3. from (3,1) i can proceed to (3,2) (also covered by contract)\n4. then finally to goal at (3,3) (only need to use my 1 green chip)\n\nresources check:\n- (3,1): need to pay 1 blue (i have 12)\n- (3,2): need to pay 1 blue (will have 11 left)\n- (3,3): need to pay 1 green (i have 1)\n\ndecision:\nmove to (3,1) as it:\n- fulfills my contract commitment\n- uses my available resources\n- advances me toward the goal\n- sets up the path to victory\n\nmove: 3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: let me analyze my current situation carefully:\n\nfrom position (3,1), my movement options are:\n1. (3,2) - blue tile (covered by contract, i must pay for other player)\n2. (2,1) - red tile (i have no red chips)\n3. (3,0) - blue tile (backwards move)\n4. (3,1) - staying (not helpful)\n\nkey considerations:\n- the other player is already at (3,2), indicating they've moved there\n- our contract requires me to pay for their moves to both (3,1) and (3,2)\n- i've already fulfilled (3,1) payment\n- now need to fulfill (3,2) payment by moving there\n- from (3,2), i can then move to goal at (3,3)\n\nresource check:\n- for (3,2): costs 1 blue (i have 10)\n- for (3,3): costs 1 green (i have 1) \n\nbest action:\n1. move to (3,2) to fulfill contract obligation\n   - pays 1 blue to other player\n   - puts me one step from victory\n2. next turn i can move to (3,3) and win\n\nthis path:\n- honors all contractual obligations\n- uses only my own remaining resources\n- achieves victory in minimal moves\n- leaves me with resources: 9 blue, 0 green after final move\n\ntherefore, the optimal move is: 3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
