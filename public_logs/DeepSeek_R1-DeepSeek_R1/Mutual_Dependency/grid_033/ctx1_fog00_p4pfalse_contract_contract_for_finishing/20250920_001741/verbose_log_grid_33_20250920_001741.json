You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

meeting all path requirements\n\n3. benefit analysis:\n- currently stuck (r:0), this gives me mobility\n- fair exchange rate (i have lots of b, they have lots of r)\n- after move to (1,0), can follow path with b tiles\n\n4. contract implications:\n- we have reciprocal 5-point agreement when either reaches goal\n- helping each other benefits both parties\n- this trade advances both our progress\n\n5. resource optimization:\n- still leaves me with ample b chips (13)\n- gives me enough r for entire path (2 when i only need 1)\n\nconclusion: this is an excellent trade that unblocks me, is fair given our resource distributions, and aligns with our mutual contract.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: let me analyze the current situation:\n\n1. current position: (0,0)\n2. current resources: b:13, g:1, r:2\n3. goal position: (3,3)\n\noptimal path resources needed: r:2, b:3, g:1 (which i now have)\nadjacent moves from (0,0):\n- right to (0,1): requires 1r\n- down to (1,0): requires 1r\n\nsince i have 2r, i can make either move. looking at the best path:\nthe suggested path starts with (0,0)->(1,0), then (1,0)->(1,1) etc.\n\ndecision:\n- move down to (1,0) as the first step in my optimal path\n- this costs 1r (leaving me with 1r for future moves)\n- puts me on position to continue path through blue tiles where i have ample resources (13b)\n\ntherefore, my move is: 1,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 1, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (1, 1)\nYou said: let me analyze my current situation and options:\n\n1. current position: (1,0) - tile color is r (red)\n2. current resources: b:13, g:1, r:1\n3. next steps in optimal path:\n   - from (1,0) → (1,1) - color b (blue)\n   - then subsequent moves also require b tiles except final g tile at goal\n\n4. available adjacent moves:\n   - up to (0,0): g - have 1g but moves me away from goal\n   - right to (1,1): b - have 13b (optimal move)\n   - down to (2,0): r - have 1r but already on red path\n   - left: not possible (edge of board)\n\n5. resource evaluation:\n   - for the first move right to (1,1): costs 1b (i have 13)\n   - after this move, i'll have b:12 remaining which covers all future b needs\n   - final g tile at (3,3) is covered by my 1g\n\nconclusion:\n- best immediate move is right to (1,1)\n- this is the first step on my optimal path\n- doesn't waste any unnecessary resources\n- maintains flexibility with my remaining r and g chips\n- costs only 1b (of my 13)\n\nmove to make: \"1,1\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((1, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
