You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 3 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'B': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (0, 2)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R B R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me analyze my situation carefully:\n\n1. current position: (0, 0) - tile color: g (green)\n2. resources: b:14, g:1, r:0\n3. immediate adjacent moves (and their costs):\n   - (1, 0): r (need 1 red) - i have 0 red - can't move\n   - (0, 1): r (need 1 red) - i have 0 red - can't move\n\nlooking at the contract we've established:\n- the other player will pay for me to move to (0,3) (red) and (2,0) (red)\n- i will pay for them to move to (3,0) (blue)\n\npotential moves using the contract:\n1. move to (0,1) - red - i don't have red, but the contract doesn't cover this tile\n2. move to (0,3) - blue - i have blue, but this isn't covered by the contract (contract covers when i'm the giver, not receiver)\n   wait, actually looking carefully at the contract:\n   - (0,3) is set as giver: other player, receiver: me, color: red\n   - so if i move to (0,3), the other player should pay 1 red (but the tile is blue, which doesn't match)\n\nthis seems like a potential miscommunication in the contract since the tile color doesn't match what's specified.\n\nalternative options:\n- i cannot make any valid moves right now because:\n  - without using contracts, i can't move to any adjacent tile (both require red which i don't have)\n  - the contracts aren't set up properly to help me move right now\n\ntherefore, i have to output \"n\" since i cannot make any valid moves toward my goal at this time.\n\nhowever, i should immediately try to negotiate with the other player to establish a proper contract that would allow me to move.\n\noutput: \"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me re-evaluate the situation carefully since we're still at turn 1 with the same position and resources. here's my analysis:\n\ncurrent state:\n- position: (0,0) - green tile\n- resources: b:14, g:1, r:0\n- available adjacent moves:\n  - (1,0): red (cost=1r, but i have 0r)\n  - (0,1): red (cost=1r, but i have 0r)\n\ncontract analysis:\n- the contract says the other player will pay for me to move to:\n  - (0,3) - but this tile is blue and contract says they'll pay red (mismatch)\n  - (2,0) - red tile (valid if they pay)\n\nproblem:\n- i can't use (0,3) contract because tile color doesn't match payment color\n- i could potentially use (2,0) contract, but i'm not adjacent to it\n- my immediate adjacent moves all require red which i don't have\n\npossible actions:\n1. \"n\" - skip turn again (not ideal)\n2. try to use (0,3) contract despite color mismatch (risky)\n3. propose a new contract to cover (1,0) or (0,1)\n\nassessment:\n- the current contract is poorly structured since (0,3) payment color doesn't match tile color\n- i need to negotiate a better contract to cover my first move to (1,0) or (0,1)\n- without any valid moves or contract coverage, i must skip\n\nconclusion:\nuntil we renegotiate the contract to properly cover my needed moves (red tiles adjacent to start), i can't make progress.\n\noutput: \"n\"\n\nhowever, i need to urgently communicate with the other player to adjust our contract. proposed new terms:\n- remove (0,3) from contract (since tile is blue but payment is red)\n- add:\n  - they pay for my move to (1,0) (red)\n  - they pay for my move to (0,1) (red)\n  - i'll maintain paying for their move to (3,0) (blue)\n\nthis would actually help both of us make progress in our respective paths.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: i realize our current contract is not helping me make progress, so i need to take a different approach:\n\n1. current position: (0,0) - green tile\n2. immediate options:\n   - (1,0): red (cost 1r) - i have 0r\n   - (0,1): red (cost 1r) - i have 0r\n\n3. contract analysis:\n   - (0,3) contract is invalid (blue tile but contract specifies red payment)\n   - (2,0) is not adjacent\n   - (3,0) is my commitment to pay for their move\n\nnew realization: the other player has plenty of red resources (12r) while i have abundant blue (14b). let's propose a trade to enable movement:\n\n\"let's make a trade: i'll give you 2 blue in exchange for 1 red. this lets both of us move forward - you can use blues for your path and i can get the red i need.\"\n\nbut for immediate action: since i can't move yet without red, i must output \"n\". however, i urgently need to complete this trade proposal to break my current stalemate.\n\noutput: \"n\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(3, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(2, 0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(0, 3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
