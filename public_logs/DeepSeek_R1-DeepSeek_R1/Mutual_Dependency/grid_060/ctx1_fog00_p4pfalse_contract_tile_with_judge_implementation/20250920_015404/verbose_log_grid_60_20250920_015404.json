You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'let’s analyze our positions and resources to create a mutually beneficial contract. \\n\\nlooking at the board:\\n- i have 14 red (r) and 1 green (g), but i’m missing blue (b) for tiles like (0,1), (1,1), etc.\\n- you have 14 blue (b) and 1 green (g), but you’re missing red (r) for tiles like (3,2), (3,3), etc.\\n\\nwe can cover each other’s deficits! here’s my proposed contract to cover critical tiles along the optimal path:\\n\\n1. **for my moves** (i need blue tiles):  \\n   - (0,1): you give me 1 b (i step onto this tile, and you pay the cost)  \\n   - (1,1): you give me 1 b  \\n   - (2,2): you give me 1 b  \\n   \\n2. **for your moves** (you likely need red tiles, e.g., (3,2), (3,3)):  \\n   - (3,2): i give you 1 r  \\n   - (3,3): i give you 1 r  \\n\\nthis way:  \\n- you cover my missing blue costs, and i cover your missing red costs.  \\n- we both reach (3,3) with minimal resource expenditure.  \\n\\nproposed formal contract terms:  \\n- (0,1): you give me 1 b  \\n- (1,1): you give me 1 b  \\n- (2,2): you give me 1 b  \\n- (3,2): i give you 1 r  \\n- (3,3): i give you 1 r  \\n\\nwould this work for you? or would you like to adjust/negotiate terms?  \\n\\n(note: if you agree, just reply with \"agree\". otherwise, propose adjustments.)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal carefully and suggest a more optimal path for both of us.\\n\\nyour proposed contract would work, but i notice some inefficiencies:\\n1. the path you're suggesting for me [(0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,2)→(3,3)] requires 3 blue chips from you, but i only need 2 blue chips to reach the goal via a slightly different path.\\n\\nhere's a more efficient contract proposal covering minimum resources needed:\\n\\nfor me:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 b (since i need to move onto this blue tile)\\n- (2,0): you give me 1 b (another blue tile)\\n- (3,1): you give me 1 b (final blue tile i need)\\n\\nfor you:\\n- (3,2): i give you 1 r\\n- (3,3): i give you 1 r\\n\\nthis way:\\n- i exactly cover all the red tiles you need (2 red chips)\\n- you exactly cover all the blue tiles i need (3 blue chips) via a path of: (0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)\\n\\nthis is more balanced because:\\n1. you save 1 blue chip compared to your original proposal\\n2. i still need to provide 2 red chips to you exactly where you need them\\n3. both paths are guaranteed to succeed\\n\\nour exchange would be: 3b for 2r, perfectly matching our needs. \\n\\nproposed contract:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 b\\n- (2,0): you give me 1 b\\n- (3,1): you give me 1 b\\n- (3,2): i give you 1 r\\n- (3,3): i give you 1 r\\n\\nwould this modified version work better for you? it achieves the same goal but with fewer resources traded overall.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze your revised proposal:\\n\\nyour suggested path for me [(0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)] would indeed work and require fewer blue chips (3 instead of 4 in my initial miscalculation). however:\\n\\n1) looking at the board:\\n- (3,0) is b (no conflict) \\n- (3,1) is r (you need r there, which i can provide)\\n- (3,2) and (3,3) are covered in both proposals\\n\\n2) comparing resources:\\n- your proposal: 3b from you, 2r from me\\n- my proposal: 3b from you, 2r from me\\n\\nactually, both proposals result in the same net exchange (3b ↔ 2r). the difference is just in which specific tiles we're covering. yours may be slightly better since it requires fewer movement steps for you. \\n\\nfinal agreement: i accept your modified proposal as it's more efficient for both of us. here's the confirmed contract:\\n\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 b\\n- (2,0): you give me 1 b\\n- (3,1): you give me 1 b\\n- (3,2): i give you 1 r\\n- (3,3): i give you 1 r\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 2: agree'}]\n\n\n2.
