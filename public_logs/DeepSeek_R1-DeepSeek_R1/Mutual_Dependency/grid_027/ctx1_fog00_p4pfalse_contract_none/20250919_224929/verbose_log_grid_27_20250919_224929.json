            "system_prompt": "\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 8 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['R', 4]]\n- You requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou said: let me analyze the situation carefully:\n\n1. current state:\n- my position: (0,1)\n- resources: b:0, g:1, r:12 (still missing 1 blue chip)\n- opponent at (2,2) with b:11, g:1, r:0\n- my optimal path still requires b:1 at (2,2)\n\n2. trade considerations:\n- previous 3r for 1b offer was rejected\n- opponent still has r:0 (needs red) and excess b:11\n- i have r:12 but need b:1\n\n3. new strategy:\nrather than giving up on trading, i'll try a more attractive offer since the opponent clearly needs red chips:\n\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"r\", 4]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"b\", 1]]\n}\n\n// increasing offer to 4 red for 1 blue to make it harder to refuse. the opponent desperately needs red chips (has 0) and has many blue chips (11). this is their only way to get red resources. losing 1 blue is insignificant for them compared to gaining 4 red.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 2) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['R', 5]]\n- You requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou said: let me reassess the trading strategy since my previous offer of 4r for 1b was rejected. here's my analysis:\n\n1. current trade dynamics:\n- my last offer: 4r for 1b (rejected)\n- opponent's resources: b:10, g:1, r:0 (desperately needs red, has blue surplus)\n- my resources: b:0, g:1, r:12 (need 1b, have r to spare)\n\n2. strategic adjustment:\n- they rejected 4:1 ratio, so i need to make an offer they can't refuse\n- their path requires red chips (they have 0)\n- i'll offer my maximum reasonable amount\n\nfinal trade proposal:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"r\", 5]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"b\", 1]]\n}\n\n// at this point, i'm willing to overpay (5:1 ratio) because:\n1. i must get that 1 blue chip to complete my path\n2. they still need red chips for their own path\n3. i have plenty of red chips (12) to spare\n4. losing 1 blue is insignificant for them (they have 10)\n5. reaching the goal is worth the tradeoff\n\nthis is my final best offer - if they reject this, i'll need to consider changing my path.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 2) to (3, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: The other player did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (0, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
