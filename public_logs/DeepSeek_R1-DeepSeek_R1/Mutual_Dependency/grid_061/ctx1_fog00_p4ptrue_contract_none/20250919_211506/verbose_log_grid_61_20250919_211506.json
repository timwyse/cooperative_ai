If you want to propose a pay4partner arrangement, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]],  # moves you will pay for when the other player makes them\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]]  # moves you want the other player to pay for when you make them\n}\n\nExample of valid arrangement:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"R\", 3]],  # you will pay for 3 moves onto Red tiles for them\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"B\", 2]]  # they will pay for 2 moves onto Blue tiles for you\n}\n\n2.
