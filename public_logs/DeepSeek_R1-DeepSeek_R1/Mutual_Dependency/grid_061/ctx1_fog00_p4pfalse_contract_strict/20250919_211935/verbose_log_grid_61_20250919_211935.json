You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 1)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: R B R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\nYou said: let me analyze my current position and plan my next move:\n\ncurrent situation:\n- position: (2,1) - blue tile\n- resources: b(11), g(1), r(0)\n- opponent at (3,2)\n- contracts still active for red tiles (1,1) and (2,1), though i'm already at (2,1)\n- shortest path requires 3 more moves to goal (3,3)\n\navailable moves from (2,1):\n1. (3,1) - red tile (down)\n2. (2,2) - red tile (right) - but occupied by opponent\n3. (1,1) - red tile (up) - backwards\n4. (2,0) - red tile (left)\n\nbest immediate decision:\n- move to (3,1) - red tile\n  - requires 1 red resource (which i don't have)\n  - no contract covers this tile since it's not (1,1) or (2,1)\n- no other valid moves toward goal (either blocked or backward)\n\nalternative options:\n1. try to negotiate a new contract for (3,1) with opponent\n2. wait for opponent to move (but they might reach goal first)\n3. consider longer path options\n\nsince:\n- i cannot make any valid moves toward goal right now\n- my shortest path is blocked by lack of red resources\n- opponent is in a better position to reach goal\n\ni must declare: n\n\n[note: i'm unable to make progress toward goal this turn due to lack of red resources and no applicable contracts]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 3)\nYou said: **final analysis:**\n\n1. **current situation:**\n   - at position (3,1) - red tile\n   - resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n   - opponent has already reached the goal at (3,3)\n   - contracts still active for (1,1) and (2,1), but irrelevant now\n   - next move to goal would require:\n     - first to (3,2) - red tile (need 1r which i don't have)\n     - then to (3,3) - green tile (i have 1g)\n\n2. **available moves:**\n   - (3,2) - red tile: requires 1r (i have 0) - can't move\n   - (2,1) - blue tile: backwards move - doesn't help\n   - (3,0) - invalid position\n\n3. **conclusion:**\n   - the opponent has already won by reaching (3,3)\n   - i cannot make any valid moves toward the goal (lack red resources)\n   - even if i could move to (3,2), the game is effectively over\n   - no strategic benefit in making any move\n\n**final decision: n**  \n[game over - opponent has reached the goal]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **game over analysis:**\n\n1. **current status:**\n   - opponent has successfully reached the goal at (3,3)\n   - they have been declared finished!\n   - the game has effectively ended with their victory\n\n2. **my position:**\n   - still at (3,1) with resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n   - while i could theoretically continue moving:\n     - to (3,2) would require 1r (which i don't have)\n     - all other moves are either invalid or backwards\n\n3. **conclusion:**\n   - continuing to attempt moves serves no purpose as:\n     1. the opponent has already won\n     2. i cannot reach the goal in any case\n     3. further moves would just be wasting resources\n     4. there's no benefit to prolonging the concluded game\n\n**final decision: n**\n\n[the game is over - opponent has won by reaching (3,3) first]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
