You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal carefully:\n\n1. first, i need to confirm my exact resource needs along the path you proposed for me [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]:\n   - (0,1): r (i need you to provide)\n   - (0,2): r (i need you to provide)\n   - (0,3): r (i need you to provide)  \n   - (1,3): r (i need you to provide)\n   - (2,3): b (i have this)\n   - (3,3): g (i have 1g)\n\nhowever, my initial analysis shows i could alternatively take a different path [(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] where:\n- (1,0): r\n- (2,0): b\n- (3,0): b\n- (3,1): b\n- (3,2): b\n- (3,3): g\n\nin this case, i would only need help with the (1,0) r and i can cover all the b's myself since i have 14b.\n\ntherefore, i propose a simpler contract that helps both of us:\n- (1,0): you give me 1r\n- (2,3): i give you 1b\n- (3,3): i give you 1b (you need this)\n\nthis way:\n1. you get the b's you need at the end (2,3) and (3,3)\n2. i get the r i need at (1,0) - the only one i can't cover\n3. the rest i can handle with my b's\n4. we both save more resources by needing fewer exchanges\n\nwould you accept this modified proposal? if not, i'm open to negotiate further, but this would be more optimal for both of us since it requires fewer resource transfers while still ensuring we both reach the goal.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: let me analyze this new proposal carefully:\n\nyour alternative path [(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)] is indeed interesting - it reduces your red needs significantly since you can leverage your blue abundance. however, i notice a few key points:\n\n1) you still need green at (3,3), which you have (1g)\n2) you'd still need r at (1,0) - which i can provide\n3) i do need b at (2,3) and (3,3) as you noted\n\nhowever, looking at my path [(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)]:\n- (2,3): b (which you would provide)\n- (3,3): b (which you would provide)\n- but i still need rs for (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3)\n\nyour modified proposal only gives you r at (1,0) but doesn't help me with my r needs on my path. i'd still be stuck needing to cover all those rs myself.\n\nhere's a compromise proposal:\n- keep your suggested transfers to help you:\n  - (1,0): i give you 1r\n  - (2,3): you give me 1b\n  - (3,3): you give me 1b\n- plus additional transfers to help me with the most critical parts of my path:\n  - (0,3): you give me 1r (helps me significantly)\n  - (1,3): you give me 1r (helps me significantly)\n\nthis way:\n1. you get minimal help (just 1r) for your alternative path\n2. i get help with 2 key rs and the bs i need\n3. you'd still have 12b remaining after giving me 2b\n4. i'd have 12r remaining after giving you 1r\n\nwould this balanced approach work for you? we both get critical help where we need it most. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: your compromise makes logical sense. let's adjust the contract to this final version:\n\nfinal contract terms:\n- (1,0): i give you 1r\n- (0,3): you give me 1r\n- (1,3): you give me 1r\n- (2,3): i give you 1b\n- (3,3): i give you 1b\n\nthis means:\n1. i receive: 1r at (1,0) (from you)\n2. you receive: 1r at (0,3), 1r at (1,3) (from me)\n3. you receive: 1b at (2,3), 1b at (3,3) (from me)\n\nthis gives both of us exactly what we need for our respective paths while keeping our remaining resources balanced. i accept these terms.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: great! here's the final contract we've agreed upon, presented in json format for confirmation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"contract_terms\": {\n    \"(1,0)\": {\"sender\": \"player2\", \"receiver\": \"player1\", \"resource\": \"r\", \"amount\": 1},\n    \"(0,3)\": {\"sender\": \"player1\", \"receiver\": \"player2\", \"resource\": \"r\", \"amount\": 1},\n    \"(1,3)\": {\"sender\": \"player1\", \"receiver\": \"player2\", \"resource\": \"r\", \"amount\": 1},\n    \"(2,3)\": {\"sender\": \"player2\", \"receiver\": \"player1\", \"resource\": \"b\", \"amount\": 1},\n    \"(3,3)\": {\"sender\": \"player2\", \"receiver\": \"player1\", \"resource\": \"b\", \"amount\": 1}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nplease confirm your agreement with:\n1. the full final contract terms above\n2. your path planning based on these terms\n\nfor my path [(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)], i'll receive 1r at (1,0) from you as agreed, and can handle the rest with my own resources.\n\nfor your path [(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)], you'll receive:\n- 2r (at 0,3 and 1,3) from me\n- 2b (at 2,3 and 3,3) from me\n\nplease confirm with \"agree\" if this matches your understanding and plans. \n\nagree \n",
