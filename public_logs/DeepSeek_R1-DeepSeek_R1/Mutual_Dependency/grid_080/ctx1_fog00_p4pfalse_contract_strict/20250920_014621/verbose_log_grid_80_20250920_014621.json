You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 6 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (1, 1)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me carefully analyze this situation again:\n\n**current status update**:\n- my position: still at (0,0) after 3 turns\n- goal: (3,3)\n- my resources: b:14, g:1, r:0\n- other player: now at (0,1), with resources: b:0, g:1, r:11 (they used 1 red to move right)\n\n**key observations**:\n1. the other player has moved next to me (they're at (0,1) now)\n2. they still have 11 red chips available\n3. our existing contracts remain unchanged\n\n**possible moves**:\n- right to (0,1): red tile (occupied by opponent) - requires 1r\n- down to (1,0): red tile - requires 1r\n- cannot move without red resources\n\n**critical insight**:\nsince the other player is now adjacent to me (at (0,1)), i could potentially:\n1. offer to trade some of my blue resources for their red\n2. alternatively, propose a new contract for them to pay for my first red move\n\nhowever, since trade negotiations aren't part of the move action, my immediate options remain limited:\n\n**available actions**:\n1. if i had red, i could move - but i don't\n2. the contract for (2,0) is still unusable as first move requires red\n3. must pass again, but should note that the opponent's position change creates new negotiation opportunities next turn\n\ntherefore, under current constraints, i must once again:\noutput: n \n\n**future strategy note**: next turn, i should actively negotiate to trade some of my abundant blue (14) for red resources, now that the opponent is adjacent and has shown willingness to move toward me.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 1)\nYou said: i'm still completely stuck and need to negotiate to move forward:\n\n**current obstacles**:\n1. i remain stranded at (0,0) with no red resources (r:0)\n2. both possible moves require red chips:\n   - right to (0,1) - red (occupied by opponent) \n   - down to (1,0) - red\n\n**new observations**:\n- the other player has now used another red chip (down to r:10)\n- they remain adjacent at (1,1) but haven't offered resources\n- our existing contract for (2,0) blue payment is still unreachable without first moving via red\n\n**strategic considerations**:\n1. **urgency**: the other player is gradually using red resources - they've used 3 red chips in 4 turns\n2. **negotiation window**: must secure red resources before they're all depleted  \n3. **leverage**: i have 14 blue chips to offer in trade\n4. **alternative path**: even if i get 1 red chip, i could move to (1,0) then use contract for (2,0)\n\n**immediate action required**:\ni must use this turn to propose:\n- offering 2-3 blue chips per red to incentivize cooperation\n- suggesting they pay for my first move to (1,0) since that enables my path\n- proposing a new contract where i'll pay more blues later in exchange\n\nhowever, since negotiation isn't part of the move action, and i still lack red resources to move:\n\n**forced decision**: \ni have no choice but to pass again while aggressively seeking negotiation next turn.\n\noutput: n\n\np.s. this situation demonstrates the critical need for an in-game negotiation system when resource dependencies create deadlocks. a simple trade interface could resolve this impasse.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **strategic proposal to end deadlock**\n\ni propose we establish a new contract to break our current impasse. here's the mutually beneficial solution:\n\n1. **immediate action**: \n   - the other player pays 1 red (r) to move me to (1,0)\n   - i can then move to (2,0) for free (our existing contract)\n\n2. **future benefit for both**:\n   - i will subsequently pay for the other player's move to (3,1) (red tile, per existing contract)\n   - additional incentive: i'll give 3 blue (b) chips to compensate for their initial red expenditure\n\n**why this works**:\n- uses existing contract structures\n- creates immediate movement potential for both players\n- balances resource exchange (my abundant blue for their red)\n- advances both toward our shared goal (3,3)\n\nsince formal negotiation isn't possible in turn actions, i must again pass but urge serious consideration of this deal. our mutual progress depends on cooperation - we're wasting turns in this stalemate.\n\noutput: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(2,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
