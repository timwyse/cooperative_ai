If you have NO missing resources (empty dict {} above), respond with exactly: \"n\"\n\n   If you have enough resources to reach your goal, say \"n\"\n\n3.

If you want to propose a pay4partner arrangement, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]],  # moves you will pay for when the other player makes them\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]]  # moves you want the other player to pay for when you make them\n}\n\nExample of valid arrangement:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"R\", 3]],  # you will pay for 3 moves onto Red tiles for them\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"B\", 2]]  # they will pay for 2 moves onto Blue tiles for you\n}\n\n2. If you don't want to propose an arrangement, respond with exactly: n\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above\n- Only ONE resource pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Numbers must be > 0\n- Don't propose arrangements with yourself\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
