Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (1, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 3) to (0, 3)\nYou said: critical situation update and move analysis:\n\n1. current position: (1,3) - blue tile\n2. failed attempt: \n   - tried to move to (2,3) using promised r coverage \n   - other player refused despite earlier agreement\n3. remaining path options:\n   - direct: (1,3)->(2,3)->(3,3) [requires r then g]\n     - blocked: no r resources, coverage promise broken\n   - alternative path: (1,3)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(3,2)->(3,3) \n     - path colors: r, b, r, g\n     - blocked: no r resources for initial moves\n\n4. current resources:\n   - b:9, g:1, r:0\n   - need r to progress but other player reneged on promise\n\n5. legal moves from current position:\n   - left to (1,2) [r] - but have no r chips\n   - right to (1,4) - invalid (off board)\n   - down to (2,3) [r] - no r chips\n   - up to (0,3) [b] - possible but away from goal\n\nno viable move toward goal available due to:\n- broken promise from other player\n- lack of r resources\n- alternative paths also require r\n\nfinal decision: \"n\" (cannot make any valid move toward goal)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 3, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 3, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 2]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 2]], \n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\n\nstrategy rationale:\n- need to secure 2 r resources to complete path to goal (1 more than originally requested)\n- offer to cover 2 b moves (reducing from original 3 to show flexibility)\n- still maintain b=6 after this trade (8 now - 2 offered)\n- other player has abundant r resources (14) and needs b\n- this creates mutual benefit: they get needed b moves, i get critical r moves\n- have them cover 2 moves since they've proven unreliable with single coverage\n- ensures enough r for both (2,3) and alternative path options\n- still preserves 1 g for final goal move\n\nnote: this is a renegotiation after previous agreement was broken\nThe other player ACCEPTED the trade\nPAY4PARTNER: You declined to cover a B move for the other player\nYou said: no\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 3) to (1, 3)\nYou said: critical path analysis and next move:\n\n1. current position: (0,3) - blue tile\n2. best path analysis:\n   - direct path: (0,3)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(3,3)\n     - costs: 1b + 1r + 1g\n     - missing: 1r (have promised coverage for 3r)\n   - alternative paths blocked due to lack of r resources\n\n3. available moves:\n   - down to (1,3) [blue] - costs 1b (have 8)\n   - up to invalid (0,2) already visited\n   - right to invalid (0,4)\n   - left no movement option\n\n4. key observations:\n   - other player has r=14 but unreliable on promises\n   - have 3 promised r covers but they may not honor them\n   - must assume i need to self-fund critical moves\n\n5. conservative strategy:\n   - move down to (1,3) using own b resources (8->7)\n   - preserves all options while building position\n   - keeps 3x r coverage promise available for later\n   - minimizes reliance on untrustworthy partner\n\n6. future planning:\n   - if they honor agreement, can use r coverage at (2,3)\n   - if not, will need to find alternate solution next turn\n\nnext move: 1,3\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 3, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 5, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 7, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 5, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 3, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [['R', 10]]\n- The other player requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou REJECTED the trade\nYou said: no\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player declined to cover a R move for you\nYou said: strategic update after failed move attempt:\n\n1. current stalemate situation:\n   - previous attempt to move to (2,3) failed when other player denied promised coverage\n   - new trade agreement secured 3 r move promises, but trust is questionable\n   - must verify if they'll honor the new arrangement\n\n2. path progression options:\n   - direct path: (1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)\n     - next move: (2,3) red tile\n     - can attempt using 1 of 3 promised r moves\n     - risk: other player may refuse again despite new agreement\n   - alternative paths: all require r moves we cannot self-fund\n\n3. resource analysis:\n   - have: b=7, g=1, r=0\n   - need: 1r (promised 3) and 1g (available)\n   - committed: 5 b moves to other player (but can refuse if needed)\n\n4. decision rationale:\n   - must test the new agreement - try moving to (2,3) using promised r\n   - if they honor it, reach goal next turn with g resource\n   - if refused, will need drastic renegotiation or alternate strategy\n\n5. move execution:\nnext move: 2,3\n[this tests the new trade agreement - if honored, we can reach goal next turn]\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 3, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 5, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 7, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 5, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 3, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((1, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {'B': 5}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {'R': 3}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
