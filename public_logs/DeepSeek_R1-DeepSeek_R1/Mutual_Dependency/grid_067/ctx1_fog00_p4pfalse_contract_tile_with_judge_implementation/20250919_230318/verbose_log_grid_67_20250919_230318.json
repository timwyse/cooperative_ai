You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(0,1) is r tile - which i don't have any r chips, but you do. your current proposal doesn't cover this.\n2. (2,1) is b tile - which i can cover (i have 14 b), but you don't have any. your current proposal doesn't cover this.\n3. the tile at (3,3) is g - we both have exactly 1 g chip to cover this.\n\ni would suggest modifying the contract as follows to cover all necessary tiles:\n\n(0,1): you give me 1 r\n(1,1): i give you 1 r\n(2,1): i give you 1 b\n(3,1): you give me 1 b\n(3,2): you give me 1 r\n\nthis way:\n- all tiles are covered where either of us lacks resources\n- we both get to our goal (3,3) while preserving our g chips for the final step\n- we minimize exchanges to only what's necessary at each critical point\n\nwhat do you think? would you agree to these terms? if you accept, please reply with \"agree\". \n, \nplayer 0: you make excellent points about the missing tiles in my initial proposal. your revised contract seems fair and comprehensive. let me check the numbers to confirm:\n\nmy resources: \n- r:14 (can give at 1,1) \n- g:1 (need to keep for goal)\n- b:0 (need to receive)\n\nyour resources:\n- r:0 (need 2 total - at 0,1 and 3,2)\n- g:1 (need to keep for goal)\n- b:14 (can give 2 - at 2,1 and 3,1)\n\nthe path breakdown:\n- (0,0) - no exchange\n- (0,1)  r (you get from me - but i see your version has opposite direction)\nwait, i notice an inconsistency - at (0,1) you propose \"you give me 1 r\" but i'm the one with r chips. shouldn't this be:\n\n(0,1): i give you 1 r (since you lack r)\n(1,1): i give you 1 r \n(2,1): i give you 1 b (but i have 0 b, this is impossible - you should give me b here)\n(3,1): you give me 1 b\n(3,2): you give me 1 r\n\ni think we need to adjust (2,1) since i cannot give you b (i have none). alternative proposal:\n\n(0,1): i give you 1 r\n(1,1): i give you 1 r\n(2,1): you give me 1 b\n(3,1): you give me 1 b\n(3,2): you give me 1 r\n\nthis way:\n- you get 2 r when needed (0,1 and 1,1)\n- i get 2 b when needed (2,1 and 3,1)\n- you get final r at 3,2 (though i could cover this myself if needed)\n\nwould this revised version work for you? if so, i'm ready to agree. please confirm or suggest adjustments. \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: you're absolutely right - my previous version had the (2,1) exchange backwards. your corrected version makes perfect sense given our resource distribution. here's the final confirmed contract:\n\n(0,1): i give you 1 r  \n(1,1): i give you 1 r  \n(2,1): you give me 1 b  \n(3,1): you give me 1 b  \n(3,2): you give me 1 r  \n\nthis ensures:\n1. you get r chips where you need them (0,1 and 1,1)\n2. i get b chips where i need them (2,1 and 3,1)\n3. you cover my final r at 3,2 (even though i could self-fund this, this balances our exchanges)\n\nthe math works perfectly:\n- i give away 2r, receive 2b and 1r (net -1r +2b)\n- you give away 2b and 1r, receive 2r (net +1r -2b)\n- both preserve our single g for the goal\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 0: agree. here's the finalized contract that we've both agreed to:\n\n{\n \"(0,1)\": \"player 1 gives player 2 1 r\",\n \"(1,1)\": \"player 1 gives player 2 1 r\",\n \"(2,1)\": \"player 2 gives player 1 1 b\",\n \"(3,1)\": \"player 2 gives player 1 1 b\",\n \"(3,2)\": \"player 2 gives player 1 1 r\"\n}\n\nthis covers all required resource exchanges along our shared path to (3,3). do you confirm this is correct? if so, we can proceed with executing this contract in our movement turns.\n\n(note: since you were the last to say \"agree\" officially, this contract is now binding unless the judge intervenes) \n",
