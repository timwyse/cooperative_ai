You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

both paths require: b=3, r=1, g=1 (i'm missing r=1 currently)\n   - the trade gives me 1 r (which i need) in exchange for 1 b (i have plenty)\n\n3. analysis:\n   - accepting the trade would give me the missing red chip i need for my path\n   - i have plenty of blue chips (13) to spare - losing 1 is negligible\n   - this enables me to complete my path successfully\n   - the contract terms don't change my decision - helping the opponent slightly is worth completing my own path\n\n4. concerns:\n   - the opponent gains a blue chip which could help them, but my priority is reaching my own goal first\n\nconclusion: this is an excellent trade for me as it provides the exact resource i'm missing while costing me a resource i have in surplus.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\nYou said: let me analyze the optimal next move:\n\n1. current position: (1,0)\n2. next possible moves toward goal (3,3):\n   - right (1,1): red tile - i have 1 red (r) chip\n   - down (2,0): blue tile - i have 12 blue (b) chips\n\n3. path analysis:\n   - both paths require next steps to be (2,0) then (2,1), so moving down to (2,0) makes most sense\n   - (2,0) requires 1 blue (i have 12 blue chips)\n   - this keeps me on track for shortest path requiring b=3/r=1/g=1 (which i have)\n\n4. why choose (2,0) over (1,1)?:\n   - directly progresses toward goal along shortest path\n   -

right to (2,1): red tile (costs 1r) - i have 1r\n   - down to (3,0): red tile (costs 1r) - doesn't advance toward goal efficiently\n\n3. path analysis:\n   - best path is right to (2,1) then up/down toward goal\n   - i have exactly enough red chips (1) to make this move\n   - after this move i'll need: 2b for remaining path (i have 11b)\n\n4. considerations:\n   - moving right advances me directly toward goal\n   - opponent is at (2,1) - but since we're both heading to same goal, some overlap is unavoidable\n   - game rules allow multiple players on same tile\n\n5. resource impact:\n   - moving to (2,1) costs 1r → 0r remaining\n   -

this move costs 1 red chip (currently have 1)\n   - after this move, i'll need:\n     * 1b to move to (2,3)\n     * then 1g to reach the goal at (3,3)\n   - i have sufficient resources for entire path:\n     * 10b (need 1)\n     * 1g (need 1)\n\n4. alternative moves:\n   -

both paths require: b=3, r=1, g=1 (i'm missing r=1 currently)\n   - the trade gives me 1 r (which i need) in exchange for 1 b (i have plenty)\n\n3. analysis:\n   - accepting the trade would give me the missing red chip i need for my path\n   - i have plenty of blue chips (13) to spare - losing 1 is negligible\n   - this enables me to complete my path successfully\n   - the contract terms don't change my decision - helping the opponent slightly is worth completing my own path\n\n4. concerns:\n   - the opponent gains a blue chip which could help them, but my priority is reaching my own goal first\n\nconclusion: this is an excellent trade for me as it provides the exact resource i'm missing while costing me a resource i have in surplus.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\nYou said: let me analyze the optimal next move:\n\n1. current position: (1,0)\n2. next possible moves toward goal (3,3):\n   - right (1,1): red tile - i have 1 red (r) chip\n   - down (2,0): blue tile - i have 12 blue (b) chips\n\n3. path analysis:\n   - both paths require next steps to be (2,0) then (2,1), so moving down to (2,0) makes most sense\n   - (2,0) requires 1 blue (i have 12 blue chips)\n   - this keeps me on track for shortest path requiring b=3/r=1/g=1 (which i have)\n\n4. why choose (2,0) over (1,1)?:\n   - directly progresses toward goal along shortest path\n   - (1,1) would take me sideways first, extending path\n   - i have sufficient blue resources\n   - opponent is at (1,1), so moving to (2,0) avoids conflict\n\n5. resources after move:\n   - moving to (2,0) would cost 1b: 12b → 11b remaining\n   - still enough for rest of path (need 2 more b)\n\nbest move is to: \"2,0\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 1, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (2, 1)\nYou said: let me analyze the optimal next move from my current position:\n\n1. current position: (2, 0)\n2. next possible moves toward goal (3,3):\n   - right to (2,1): red tile (costs 1r) - i have 1r\n   - down to (3,0): red tile (costs 1r) - doesn't advance toward goal efficiently\n\n3. path analysis:\n   - best path is right to (2,1) then up/down toward goal\n   - i have exactly enough red chips (1) to make this move\n   - after this move i'll need: 2b for remaining path (i have 11b)\n\n4. considerations:\n   - moving right advances me directly toward goal\n   - opponent is at (2,1) - but since we're both heading to same goal, some overlap is unavoidable\n   - game rules allow multiple players on same tile\n\n5. resource impact:\n   - moving to (2,1) costs 1r → 0r remaining\n   - still have sufficient b (11) for rest of path\n\n6. alternative options:\n   - staying put gains nothing\n   - moving down to (3,0) is suboptimal path\n   - no viable alternatives that make progress\n\nbest strategic move is to proceed right to (2,1). while this risks a temporary tile sharing situation with the opponent, it's the most efficient path forward given my current resources and position.\n\ntherefore, the optimal move is: \"2,1\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (2, 2)\nYou said: let me analyze my next optimal move:\n\n1. current position: (2,1)\n2. best path options to goal (3,3):\n   - right to (2,2): red tile - requires 1r (i have 1r)\n   - down to (3,1): red tile - requires 1r but takes me away from optimal path\n\n3. key considerations:\n   - moving right to (2,2) is the next step on my optimal path\n   - this move costs 1 red chip (currently have 1)\n   - after this move, i'll need:\n     * 1b to move to (2,3)\n     * then 1g to reach the goal at (3,3)\n   - i have sufficient resources for entire path:\n     * 10b (need 1)\n     * 1g (need 1)\n\n4. alternative moves:\n   - down to (3,1) would require 1r but is less efficient\n   - left/up moves don't progress toward goal\n   - sharing tile with opponent at (2,1) is temporary and allowed\n\n5. strategic advantages:\n   - completes path in minimum moves (3 total)\n   - maintains resource advantage\n   - possibly reaches goal before opponent\n\nbest move is to proceed right to (2,2):\n\n\"2,2\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
