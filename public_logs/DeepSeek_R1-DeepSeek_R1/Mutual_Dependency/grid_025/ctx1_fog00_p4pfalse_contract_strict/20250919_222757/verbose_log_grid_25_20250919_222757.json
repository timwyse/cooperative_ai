Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
            "agent_response": "let me reassess the situation and potential moves:\n\ncurrent status:\n- position: (2,1) - blue tile\n- resources: 11b, 1g, 0r\n- critical missing resource: 1r for next step to (2,2)\n- other player has 12r but contracts don't help for my current position\n\navailable moves analysis:\n1. (2,2) - red tile (costs 1r) - can't move (no r resources)\n2. (1,1) - red tile (costs 1r) - can't move and moves backward\n3. (2,0) - blue tile (costs 1b) - moves backward\n4. (3,1) - blue tile (costs 1b) - moves away from goal but keeps me active\n\nwhile (3,1) is the only possible move, it's strategically poor because:\n- wastes 1b (i have plenty, but still)\n- moves away from optimal path\n- doesn't solve my r shortage problem\n\nalternative considerations:\n- the contract for (2,2) has me paying b (which i have) for their move, but doesn't help me get r\n- other player has 12r - perhaps we need to renegotiate\n- waiting preserves resources and maintains position near goal\n\noptimal choice is to stay put again (n) because:\n1. no progress can be made toward goal without r\n2. any other move wastes resources or moves away from goal\n3. better to wait for negotiation opportunity to get needed r\n\nrecommendation: n\n\ni should use the next negotiation phase to secure r resources in exchange for my plentiful b resources. the current contract terms aren't helping my immediate needs.\n\noutput: n"
