You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: R B R R\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

this is the only other adjacent tile (since we can't move diagonally)\n   \n6. conclusion:\n   - i cannot make any valid move toward my goal from my current position with my current resources.\n\ntherefore, the correct response is: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [['R', 1]]\n- The other player requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou ACCEPTED the trade\nYou said: let's evaluate the trade offer carefully:\n\n1. current resources:\n   - me: b=14, g=1, r=0\n   - opponent: r=13 (they have plenty of r)\n\n2. trade offer: they give me 1r for my 1b\n\n3. analysis:\n   - i need 2r total for my best path to goal (1r for (1,0) and 1r for (2,0))\n   - after this trade, i'd have b=13, r=1 - enough to make my first move to (1,0)\n   - i still need 1 more r for (2,0), but this is progress\n   - i have plenty of b (14 => 13 is still sufficient for later moves)\n   - opponent has r to spare and needs b (which i have plenty of)\n   - the contract terms don't incentivize helping/hindering the other player (both payments are 0)\n\n4. conclusion:\n   - this trade helps me make progress toward my goal\n   - it's a fair exchange given our resource distributions\n   - there's no contractual reason not to accept\n   - i still maintain enough b for future moves\n\nyes\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 1]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: let me analyze my current situation:\n\n1. my goal path requires: r=2, b=3, g=1\n2. my current resources: r=1, b=13, g=1\n3. missing resources: r=1 (need 2 total, have 1)\n\ni'm still missing 1 red resource to complete my path.\n\nthe other player has r=12 (plenty) and needs b (they only have 1). \n\nproposed trade:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 1]], \n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n\nthis gives me the final red i need while exchanging our abundant resources (i have plenty of b, they have plenty of r).\nThe other player ACCEPTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: let's analyze my current situation:\n\n1. current position: (0, 0) -

i have 2 red resources (enough to move there)\n   - movement would cost 1 r (leaving me with r=1)\n   \n5. after this move sequence would be:\n   - (1,0)->r (cost 1r)\n   - (2,0)->b (cost 1b)\n   - (3,0)->b (cost 1b)\n   - (3,1)->b (cost 1b)\n   - (3,2)->r (cost 1r)\n   - (3,3)->g (cost 1g)\n   \n6. verifying total path costs:\n   - r: 1 (current) + 1 (for (3,2)) = 2 total r needed (i have 2)\n   - b: 3 needed (i have 12)\n   -

(0,0) - green (already visited)\n   - (1,1) - blue ('b')\n   - (2,0) - blue ('b') - best path direction\n\n5. checking resources for move to (2,0):\n   - (2,0) is blue, costs 1b\n   - i have 12 blue resources (plenty)\n   -

(1,1) is blue but doesn't progress toward goal efficiently\n   - (0,0) would be backtracking\n\n8. conclusion:\n   - can and should move to (2,0)\n   - this maintains progress toward goal while conserving resources\n   -

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

after this trade, i'd have b=13, r=1 - enough to make my first move to (1,0)\n   - i still need 1 more r for (2,0), but this is progress\n   - i have plenty of b (14 => 13 is still sufficient for later moves)\n   - opponent has r to spare and needs b (which i have plenty of)\n   - the contract terms don't incentivize helping/hindering the other player (both payments are 0)\n\n4. conclusion:\n   - this trade helps me make progress toward my goal\n   -

required: 1b, 1r, 1g (all of which i have)\n   \n4. resource assessment:\n   - i have exactly enough for my path (10b,1r,1g)\n   - the trade would give me extra red (r=3) but reduce my blue (b=9)\n   -

next move to (3,1): needs 1b - i have 10 (can move there)\n   - after that: would need 1r and 1g, which i have\n   - total path cost: 1b, 1r, 1g (i have sufficient for all)\n\n5. alternative moves:\n   -

they offer: 3 red (but i only need 1 for immediate move)\n   - they request: 1 blue (which i have plenty of)\n   - after trade: i'd have b=8, r=4\n\n4. benefit assessment:\n   - i already have all resources needed to reach goal\n   - extra red resources provide no additional value\n   - losing blue doesn't hurt my path but provides no benefit\n   - contract terms don't incentivize helping opponent\n\n5. strategic consideration:\n   - goal is within reach with current resources\n   - no need to potentially help opponent who is resource-strapped for blue\n\nconclusion: \nthere is no strategic advantage to accepting this trade as it doesn't help me reach my goal faster or with more resources, and may help my opponent unnecessarily.\n\nno\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: let me analyze my current position and options:\n\n1. current position: (3,1) -

for (3,3): need 1g (i have exactly 1)\n5. adjacent options:\n   - (3,2) is only viable forward move (red tile)\n   - (2,1) and (3,0) are steps backward\n6. risk assessment:\n   - moving now would leave me with r=0, g=1\n   -
