For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
            "agent_response": "**strategic decision: \"n\"**  \n\n**updated analysis:**  \n1. **current position & obstacles**  \n   - stuck at (3,0) with **0 red chips (r=0)**. next move to (3,1) requires **1r**.  \n   - other player blocks (3,1) with **r=9, b=1, g=1**. they need **1b** to advance to (3,2)—their next move.  \n\n2. **trade rejections & new insights**  \n   - previous offers rejected:  \n     - 1b → 1r  \n     - 2b + 1g → 1r  \n   - other player clearly prioritizes retaining red chips (*possibly aiming to force a stalemate or reach goal first*).  \n\n3. **alternative path evaluation**  \n   - **new path**: [(3,0)→(2,0)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3)]  \n     - costs: **2b (for 2,0 and 3,2) + 1r (for 2,1) + 1g (goal)**  \n     - missing: **1r** for (2,1) (same bottleneck).  \n\n4. **critical needs & options**  \n   - **must acquire 1r** to proceed via any viable path.  \n   - **final trade attempt**: offer **3b → 1r** (maximizing value for other player while preserving my path flexibility).  \n\n5. **contingency plan**  \n   - if trade fails again:  \n     - **move to (2,0)** (blue tile, cost 1b) to open alternative route.  \n     - **sacrifices position** but avoids total deadlock.  \n\n**action:**  \n- with no better immediate options, **hold position (\"n\")** and monitor opponent’s next move.  \n- if other player moves to (3,2), consider taking (3,1) if r is acquired later.  \n\n---  \n**next trade proposal (if allowed next turn):**  \n```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 3]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\n```"
