You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 7 ===\n\n- You are at position (1, 1)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 4, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"1,2\"\n\nanalysis:\n1. next step in optimal path: (1,1) → (1,2)\n2. tile color at (1,2): b (from board layout: row 1 shows r b b r)\n3. resource check: \n   - have 11b, cost 1b (will have 10b left)\n   - enough for future moves (2,2)=r(1 needed), (3,2)=b(1 needed), (3,3)=g(1 needed)\n4. opponent is at (3,2) - they've reached what would normally be my waypoint\n5. observation: need to ensure they don't block my path, but they're ahead so no direct conflict\n\nthis move:\n- progresses me along optimal horizontal path (opponent went vertical)\n- maintains resource sufficiency (still 10b after this move)\n- keeps me on track - next moves will be:\n   - (1,2) → (2,2) costing 1r\n   - (2,2) → (3,2) costing 1b\n   - (3,2) → (3,3) costing 1g\n- uses my abundant blue resources effectively\n\nalternative considerations:\n- could consider diagonal path but would require more resources\n- current path still optimal given resource constraints\n\nno trade needed as i have sufficient resources for entire remaining path.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"1,2\"\n\ncritical update:\n- opponent has reached the goal at (3,3)\n- game ends - no more moves can be made\n- final resource count: b=11, g=1, r=1\n- since i didn't reach the goal, i score 0 points\n\ngame analysis:\n1. despite planning optimal paths, opponent reached goal first\n2. need to move faster in future games\n3. resource management was good, but speed was lacking\n4. alternative strategies to consider:\n   - more aggressive early game movement\n   - assess opponent's progress more frequently\n   - consider riskier but faster paths when behind\n\nconclusion:\ngame ends in loss - will apply these lessons to future matches\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: the game has concluded - the opponent has already reached the goal at (3,3) in turn 5. since they reached the goal first, the game is over and no further moves or actions are possible.\n\nfinal game outcome:\n1. status: game over\n2. winner: opponent (reached goal first)\n3. your position: remained at (1,1)\n4. final resources: {'b':11, 'g':1, 'r':1} \n5. your score: 0 points (since you didn't reach the goal)\n6. opponent's score: 65 points (20 for reaching goal + 45 for 9 remaining r chips)\n\nkey takeaways:\n1. timing issue: while my resource management and path planning were sound, i moved too cautiously\n2. opponent monitoring: needed to better track opponent's progress - they moved vertically much faster\n3. early game: should have been more aggressive with initial movements\n4. adaptability: when falling behind, needed to consider alternative strategies rather than sticking rigidly to initial plan\n\nno further moves can be made - the game is complete. the only possible response is to acknowledge the end state with:\n\n\"n\" \n\n(no action possible in completed game)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
