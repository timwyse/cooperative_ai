            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 3 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (2, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B R\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let's analyze the situation and determine the best move.\n\ncurrent position: (0, 0) - green\ngoal: (3, 3)\n\nfrom the best path options shown, the first move is to (1,0) which is red:\n- (1,0) is red, and i have 0 red (r) chips\n- in the contract, it shows that if i move to (1,0), the other player will pay the red chip for me (as i'm the receiver for (1,0) red)\n- this is valid because the contract specifies: '(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'} - wait, no! actually looking more closely, this seems to indicate i would be paying for the other player's move to (1,0), not them paying for me.\n\ni should double-check:\n- the contract shows two entries:\n  - (0,2): other player pays for me to move onto blue (but (0,2) isn't in my planned path)\n  - (1,0): i would pay for the other player to move onto red (which doesn't help me)\n\nlooking at adjacent moves from (0,0):\npossible adjacent moves:\n- (0,1) - red (i have 0 r)\n- (1,0) - red (i have 0 r)\ni don't have any red chips, and no contract covers me receiving help to move to these positions.\n\nalternative thoughts:\n- the contract covers (0,2) blue, but this isn't part of my optimal path\n- moving to (0,2) would cost me nothing (other player pays), but it moves me away from goal\n- doesn't seem beneficial\n\nsince i cannot make any valid moves toward my goal (don't have red for (1,0) or (0,1)) and there's no contract to help me, i must output \"n\".\n\noutput: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me re-examine the situation carefully now that we're on turn 1:\n\ncurrent position: (0, 0) - green tile\ngoal: (3, 3)\nmy resources: b=14, g=1, r=0\nother player's position: (2, 0) - they moved from (1,0) to (2,0) last turn\n\nlooking at possible moves from (0,0):\n1. (0,1) - red - i have 0 red chips\n2. (1,0) - red - i have 0 red chips\n3. if i could get to (0,2), other player would pay (contract), but it's blue and i have blue chips\n   - however, (0,2) is not in my optimal path\n   - moving there would take me away from the goal direction\n   - would require more moves to circle back\n\ncontract analysis:\n- the contract for (1,0) requires me to pay for the other player to move there\n- this doesn't help me at all\n- the contract for (0,2) would help me move there if i wanted to, but it's counterproductive\n\nresources needed for optimal path:\n- first step requires red which i don't have\n- the other player has r=12 but no contract helps me get red chips\n\nalternative options:\n1. try to propose a new contract where they give me red chips\n   - but this would require negotiation which we can't do in this move\n2. try to move anyway and hope\n   - but i have no red chips\n3. remain stuck and suggest terminating the game if possible\n   - but rules require me to reach the goal\n\ngiven that:\n- i cannot make any productive moves toward my goal\n- no contracts help me move in the right direction\n- i cannot acquire needed resources this turn\n\nfinal decision: n\n\n(note: the optimal solution would be to negotiate with the other player to modify the contract to help me get red chips, but since we can't do that in this move format, i must pass again.)\n\noutput: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me take a strategic approach for turn 2, considering i'm still stuck at (0,0):\n\ncurrent analysis:\n- i desperately need red chips to move toward my goal (both adjacent tiles require red)\n- the other player has 12 red chips but i have no way to get them under current contract\n- current contract only helps me move to (0,2) (blue, which i have plenty of) but that's counterproductive\n- the (1,0) contract term is useless to me (i pay for their move)\n\nalternative plan:\n1. i have 14 blue chips - more than i need for the optimal path (which requires 3b)\n2. the other player has 0 blue chips - they may need blue later\n3. i could use the (0,2) contract to move there (other player pays)\n   - costs me nothing\n   - from (0,2) i can try to reach (1,2) then (2,2) etc. - alternate path to goal\n   - not ideal but better than being stuck\n\npath via (0,2):\n(0,0)->(0,2)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(3,2)->(3,3)\ncosts:\n- (0,2): free (contract)\n- (1,2): b (i have 14)\n- (2,2): r (still a problem but maybe i can get some red later)\n- (3,2): b\n- (3,3): g (i have 1)\n\nwhile not optimal, this gets me moving and may force the other player to negotiate for blue chips i have.\n\ntherefore, for this turn:\n- move to (0,2) using the contract (other player pays 1b)\n- this is better than staying stuck\n- may create negotiation opportunities in future turns\n\nfinal decision: \"0,2\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0, 2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'blue'}, '(1, 0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
