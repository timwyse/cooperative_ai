A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n- The other player is at position (2, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R B R\nRow 2: R B B B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nYou said: \"0,1\"  # moving to the red tile at (0,1) since i currently have no red resources but i'm proposing a trade to get coverage for red moves\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nYou said: \"0,1\"  # moving to the red tile at (0,1) again since i proposed a trade but haven't received confirmation yet - this will force the trade resolution\n\ni'm trying to advance toward my goal (3,3) via the optimal path: [(0,0)→(0,1)→(0,2)→(1,2)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3)], which requires:\n- 1 red (current move)\n- 4 blue \n- 1 green\n\nsince i have:\n- 14 blue (can cover other player's blue moves)\n- 1 green\n- 0 red (need coverage)\n\nby moving to (0,1) now, i'm:\n1) testing if the other player will cover my red move per our proposed trade\n2) making progress toward goal while trade is negotiated\n3) putting pressure to resolve the trade agreement\n\nif they reject covering this move, i'll need to negotiate differently or find an alternate path. but this is the most efficient way forward if they honor the proposed trade.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: since my proposed trade has not been accepted yet and i have 0 red resources to move to (0,1), i need to either:\n\n1. wait for the trade agreement before making the red move, or\n2. find an alternative path that doesn't require red resources\n\nlooking at the board:\n- i could instead go down to (1,0) - but that's a red tile (can't move)\n- i could also try an alternative path: (0,0)→(0,1)→(1,1)→(2,1)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) \n   - requires: 3 red + 2 blue + 1 green\n   - but i still need reds\n\nsince i can't make any legal moves toward my goal without red resources (which i lack and haven't secured coverage for yet), i'm forced to:\n\n\"n\"  # cannot make any valid move toward goal at this time\n\nnote: this should trigger the need to finalize the trade agreement before proceeding. the ideal path still requires only 1 red move (if they cover it), so i'll continue pushing for the trade while being unable to move until it's resolved.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
