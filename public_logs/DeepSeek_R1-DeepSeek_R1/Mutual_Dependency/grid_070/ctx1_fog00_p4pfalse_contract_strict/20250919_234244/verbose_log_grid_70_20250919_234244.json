You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- The other player is at position (1, 1)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: let me analyze my current position and options carefully:\n\n1. current position: (2,0) - blue tile\n2. my resources: b:13, g:1, r:0\n3. best path analysis shows i need:\n   - next step: (3,0) - blue tile\n   - following path requires: b:2, r:1, g:1 total\n   - i'm missing 1 red for the complete path\n\nadjacent move options:\n- down to (3,0): blue tile (costs 1 blue - i have 13)\n- right to (2,1): blue tile (costs 1 blue - but not optimal toward goal)\n- left: invalid\n- up: would move away from goal\n\ncontract situation:\n- contract for (3,3) requires me to pay red to other player\n- other player still has r:11, so they could potentially help if needed\n\nbest move:\n- move down to (3,0) using my own blue resources\n- this makes progress toward goal while maintaining flexibility\n- will need to address red requirement at (3,2) later, possibly through renegotiation\n\ncommand: \"3,0\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: let me carefully assess my current position and options:\n\n1. current position: (3,0) - blue tile\n2. my resources: b:12, g:1, r:0\n3. adjacent moves toward goal (3,3):\n   - right to (3,1): blue tile (costs 1 b)\n   - other directions would take me away from goal\n\npath analysis:\n- next steps: (3,1) [b], (3,2) [r], (3,3) [g]\n- resources needed: 1b, 1r, 1g\n- i'm missing 1 red chip to complete the path\n\ncontract review:\n- contract for (3,3): i must pay 1 red to other player when reaching goal\n- other player has r:11 available\n\nbest strategy:\n1. move right to (3,1) using my blue resources (command: \"3,1\")\n   - this makes progress along the optimal path\n   - keeps options open for future negotiations about the red tile at (3,2)\n2. after this move, i'll need to either:\n   - acquire a red chip through negotiation\n   - or find an alternative path (though none exists in this case)\n\nsince i have sufficient blue chips (12) to make this move and it progresses me toward the goal, this is the optimal play.\n\nmove: \"3,1\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou said: let me analyze the current situation:\n\n1. current position: (3,1) - blue tile\n2. my resources: b:11, g:1, r:0\n3. next required move toward goal: \n   - right to (3,2): red tile (i have 0 red chips)\n   - cannot complete the path without red chip\n\navailable options:\n1. try moving to (3,2) using the contract system:\n   - currently no contract exists for (3,2)\n   - the other player has 11 red chips they could potentially trade\n\n2. stay put (output \"n\") and attempt to negotiate:\n   - need to get 1 red chip from other player to proceed\n   - could offer blue chips in exchange since i have many (11)\n   - contract for (3,3) exists where i must pay red at endgame\n\nbest course of action:\n- since i can't move to the red tile at (3,2) without red chips\n- and there's no active contract to cover this move\n- i must stay put and negotiate for red chips\n\nrecommended move: \"n\"\n\nafter this, i should propose to the other player:\n- \"can you pay 1 red for my move to (3,2)? i can pay you 2 blue in return, or fulfill future contracts\" \n- or propose amending the existing (3,3) contract to include (3,2) as well\n- without acquiring red chips, i cannot progress toward the goal\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
