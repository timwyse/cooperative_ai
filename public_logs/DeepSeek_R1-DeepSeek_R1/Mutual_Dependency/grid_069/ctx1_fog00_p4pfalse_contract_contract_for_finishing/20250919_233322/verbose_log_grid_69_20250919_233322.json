You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 4, 'B': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

right to (0,1): r (i have 0 r, cannot move)\n   - down to (1,0): r (i have 0 r, cannot move)\n\ni cannot make any immediate valid moves toward my goal because both possible moves require red chips which i don't have (r=0).\n\nlooking at the suggested paths:\n- both paths show i'm missing 2 red chips (r=2 needed but r=0 available)\n- i have plenty of blue chips (b=14) and 1 green chip (g=1)\n\npossible actions:\n1. try to trade with the other player (they have r=13 but need b=0)\n2. find a longer path that doesn't require red chips\n3. look for alternative first moves\n\nsince i can't move anywhere right now (both adjacent tiles require red), my only immediate option is to engage in trading.\n\nhowever, the instruction says to output \"n\" if i cannot make any valid move toward my goal. in this case, that's true - both adjacent moves require red which i don't have.\n\ntherefore, my output is: n\n\nafter this, i should attempt to negotiate with the other player to trade some of my abundant blue chips for their red chips.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n- You: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [['R', 1]]\n- The other player requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou ACCEPTED the trade\nYou said: let me analyze this trade offer carefully:\n\ncurrent resource situation:\n- i have b=14, g=1, r=0\n- need r=2 more to complete my path\n- other player is offering r=1 in exchange for b=1\n\nimpact of accepting:\n- would leave me with b=13, g=1, r=1 - still need 1 more r for my path\n- would help me move toward solving my immediate blocking issue (needing red chips)\n- blue chips are currently my most abundant resource (14)\n\ncontract implications:\n- we've agreed to give each other 10 points upon reaching goal\n- helping them helps me get 10 points when they finish\n- but my primary goal is reaching my own destination first\n\nconsidering alternatives:\n- without this trade, i'm completely stuck - can't make any moves\n- even partial progress on red chips is valuable\n- the trade is very fair (1:1 exchange)\n\nconclusion:\nthis trade moves me closer to being able to make progress, uses my abundant resource (blue), and is fair. while it doesn't fully solve my red chip shortage, it's a step in the right direction.\n\nyes\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 1]]\n- You requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 1]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 1]]\n}\nThe other player ACCEPTED the trade\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: let me analyze my current situation:\n\ncurrent status:\n- position: (0,0)\n- resources: b=12, g=1, r=2\n- goal: (3,3)\n- adjacent moves:\n  - right to (0,1): r (i have r=2, can afford)\n  - down to (1,0): r (i have r=2, can afford)\n\npath analysis:\n- my best paths (both require r=2, b=3, g=1)\n- current resources exactly match path requirements\n- no missing resources (empty dict) for both paths\n\nsince i have all required resources for the best path, i should start moving toward my goal. \n\nlooking at adjacent moves:\n1. right to (0,1): red tile (costs 1r)\n   - leads toward the first step in optimal path\n   - would leave me with r=1 for rest of path that requires r=2\n   - not ideal since i'd be short 1r for later moves\n\n2. down to (1,0): red tile (costs 1r) \n   - valid first move in proposed optimal path\n   - would leave me with r=1 which still allows completing requirements\n   - this matches the path: (0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0)...\n\nstrategic consideration:\n- moving down makes more sense as it's part of the optimal path\n- after this move i'll still have r=1 (after paying r=1) which is sufficient since the path only needs 2r total (i've already paid 1)\n\ntherefore, the best move is to move down to (1,0). \n\n1,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 12, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 0) to (2, 0)\nYou said: let me analyze my current situation:\n\ncurrent position: (1,0)\ngoal: (3,3)\ncurrent resources: b=12, g=1, r=1\nadjacent moves:\n- up to (0,0): g (but this moves away from goal)\n- right to (1,1): r\n- down to (2,0): b\n- left: none (edge of board)\n\noptimal path analysis:\n- next step in my best path is (2,0) (blue tile)\n- i have 12 blue chips (more than enough for this move)\n- after this move: \n  - will pay 1b (down to 11b)\n  - still have enough resources for full path (needing 3b total)\n  \nstrategic considerations:\n1. moving right to (1,1) costs 1r (i have 1r but need to conserve it for later)\n2. moving down to (2,0) is:\n   - along optimal path\n   - uses abundant blue chips (12 available)\n   - doesn't use precious red chips needed later\n   - directly progresses toward goal\n\nother observations:\n- the other player appears to be moving toward their goal as well\n- no trading needed currently as i have sufficient resources\n- important to conserve red chips for the 1r needed later in path\n\nbest action: move down to (2,0) using 1 blue chip.\n\n2,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 2, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (2, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 1}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
