You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \nIn 'pay for other' mode, any resources you have promised to give to other players as part of trade agreements are still counted as your resources (and hence potential contributors to your final score) until you actually give them away.\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['G', 1]]\n- You requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"g\", 1]], \n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"b\", 1]]\n}\n```\n\nrationale:\ngiven the repeated rejections of red-for-blue trades, i'm now offering my only green resource (which the other player lacks) to secure the crucial blue i need. \n\nkey points:\n- the other player has 1g and needs more for their path\n- i'm only offering 1g (all i have) to minimize my commitment\n- still requesting 1b to unlock my final moves toward victory\n- this creates a new bargaining opportunity after previous rejections\n- if accepted, lets me use my promised b coverage for (3,2) and keep moving\n- maintains good faith while finding alternative trade terms\n\ngiven our stalemate on red trades and the other player's need for green, this offer might finally break the deadlock while keeping me on track to win.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['R', 1]]\n- You requested: [['B', 1]]\nYou said: ```json\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"r\", 1]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"b\", 1]]\n}\n```\n\nrationale: despite repeated rejections, i'm trying one last time with a simple 1:1 trade offer because:\n1. the other player is now at (3,2) and may be more willing to trade\n2. they've shown resistance to larger trade offers\n3. i have sufficient red resources (9)\n4. they still have 10 blue resources\n5. this maintains our existing agreement balance (i owe 1r, they owe 2b)\n6. getting just 1 more blue move would complete my path to victory\n\nsmallest possible trade that meets my needs while being least demanding of the other player. if rejected again, i'll use my existing promised blue moves to win.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: The other player moved from (3, 2) to (3, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 8 ===\nMOVE: The other player did not move\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
