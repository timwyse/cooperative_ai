You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze the situation carefully:\\n\\n1) my best path requires 2b, but i have 0b. you have 14b but need r which i have plenty of (14r). \\n2) your best path likely requires r which you don't have (0r), while i have excess r.\\n\\nhere's my proposed contract to complete both our paths efficiently:\\n\\nfor my movement:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1b (blue tile)\\n- (2,0): you give me 1b (blue tile)\\n\\nfor your movement:\\n- (0,1): i give you 1r (red tile)\\n- (0,2): i give you 1r (green tile) - but since you have 1g you may not need this\\n- or alternatively for any red tiles in your path, i can provide r chips\\n\\nthis way:\\n- i can complete my path by getting the 2b i need from you\\n- you can complete your path by getting r chips from me when needed\\n\\nwould this work for you? we can adjust which specific tiles we trade for based on your path requirements.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal:\\n\\n1) i notice you have a misunderstanding - my current best path [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] requires:\\n- total: 4b, 1r, 1g\\n- i already have 14b and 1g, but i'm missing 1r\\n\\n2) you are correct that:\\n- you need r (have 14) but have no b (need 4 in your best path)\\n- i have excess b (14) but need r (have 0)\\n\\na more accurate contract would be:\\n\\nfor my movement:\\n- (2,1): you give me 1r (red tile)\\n\\nfor your movement:\\n- (1,0): i give you 1b (blue tile)\\n- (1,1): i give you 1b (blue tile)\\n- (2,1): i give you 1b (blue tile)\\n- (3,1): i give you 1b (blue tile)\\n\\nthis covers:\\n- my only missing resource (1r)\\n- all your needed b resources (4 total)\\n\\nthis leaves both of us able to complete our paths while helping each other. agree?\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"i see your point and agree this is more efficient. however, my best path requires 2b (not 4b) at tiles (1,0) and (2,0). your path requires 1r at (2,1).\\n\\nhere's a counter-proposal that's equally effective with fewer chip exchanges:\\n\\nfor my movement:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1b\\n- (2,0): you give me 1b \\n\\nfor your movement:\\n- (2,1): i give you 1r\\n\\nthis covers:\\n- all my needed b resources (only 2 required)\\n- your only needed r resource\\n\\nbenefits:\\n1) fewer chip exchanges (3 instead of 5)\\n2) still satisfies both our minimal requirements\\n3) more chips remain in our inventories for end-game scoring\\n\\nwould you accept this more efficient version? agree?\"}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
