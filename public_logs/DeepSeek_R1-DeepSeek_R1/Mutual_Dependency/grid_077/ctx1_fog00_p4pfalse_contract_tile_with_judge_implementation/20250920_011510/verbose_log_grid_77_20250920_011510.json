You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze our positions and resources carefully:\\n\\n1. my best path requires 1 b, 4 r, and 1 g, but i'm missing 1 b. you have plenty of b (14) but are missing r.\\n2. your best path would likely require b resources where mine requires r, as we're starting from the same position but have opposite resource strengths.\\n\\ni propose this contract to help both of us reach (3,3):\\n\\nfor my path:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 b (i need this to move here from (0,0))\\n- (2,1): i give you 1 r (you'll likely need this to move here from (2,0))\\n\\nfor your path:\\n- (1,1): i give you 1 r (you'll need this to move here from (1,0))\\n- (3,2): you give me 1 r (i need this to move here from (3,2) to (3,3))\\n\\nthis balances our resource needs - you get rs where you need them and i get bs where i need them. \\n\\nwhat do you think of this proposal? we can adjust the specific tiles if you have a different preferred path.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal and respond with a counter-proposal that better fits my needs:\\n\\n1. looking at my optimal path: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)]\\n   this requires: 3 b, 1 g, 2 r\\n   resources i have: 14 b, 1 g, 0 r\\n   so i'm only missing 2 r total\\n\\n2. your proposed contract would:\\n   - give you 1 b (which you don't really need since you have 14)\\n   - cost me 2 r\\n\\nhere's my counter-proposal that better matches our actual resource needs:\\n\\nfor my path:\\n- (0,1): you give me 1 r\\n- (0,2): you give me 1 r\\n\\nfor your path:\\n- (1,0): i give you 1 b\\n- (3,1): i give you 1 b\\n\\nthis way:\\n1. i get the 2 r i need for my path\\n2. you get 2 b that you need for your path\\n3. we're exchanging equal numbers of resources (2 for 2)\\n\\nnote that for my path i still need to use 1 g at (3,3) which i already have.\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze your counter-proposal carefully:\\n\\n1. your proposed contract would:\\n   - give me 2 b (at (1,0) and (3,1))\\n   - give you 2 r (at (0,1) and (0,2))\\n   \\n2. let's verify if this covers all our needs:\\n   for my path [(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)]:\\n   - (1,0): covered by you giving me 1 b (perfect)\\n   - (3,1): i don't actually pass through (3,1) in my path\\n   - i still need to pay 1 g at (3,3) which i have\\n\\nwould you consider modifying to:\\n\\nfor my path:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 b\\n- (2,0): you give me 1 b \\n   (i need to pay r here but have plenty, but since you're giving me b it would help)\\n\\nfor your path:\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 r\\n- (0,2): i give you 1 r\\n\\nthis way:\\n1. you get your 2 needed r\\n2. i get 2 b in places that actually help me\\n3. still balanced 2-for-2 exchange\\n\\nwould this modified version work for you?\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 2: i see your point - let me review our paths again and finalize the contract:\\n\\nyour revised proposal makes sense for these reasons:\\n1. my path does need b at both (1,0) and (2,0)\\n2. your path still gets the r it needs at (0,1) and (0,2)\\n3. we're maintaining a balanced 2-resource exchange\\n\\nfinal agreed terms:\\n\\nfor my movement:\\n- (1,0): you give me 1 b\\n- (2,0): you give me 1 b\\n\\nfor your movement:\\n- (0,1): i give you 1 r\\n- (0,2): i give you 1 r\\n\\nthis ensures:\\n1. i can complete my path with your 2 b\\n2. you can complete your path with my 2 r\\n3. no leftover resource debts\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'agree'}]\n\n\n2.
