This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\n\nYou have been asked by the other player to cover their movement cost onto a tile of color B as part of a previous trade agreement. Here are your past agreements with this player:\n[\"On turn 0, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [['R', 4]] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [['B', 1]] to Player 0.\", \"On turn 5, Player 0 and Player 1 agreed that at some stage in the future, Player 0 would pay [['R', 2]] to Player 1 in exchange for Player 1 at some stage in the future paying for [['B', 1]] to Player 0.\"]\nDo you agree to pay a B resource to cover the other player? Although you previously agreed to this with the other player, it is not mandatory. Remember that you are trying to maximise your points. List your options and the pros and cons of each, and finish your response with 'yes' if you agree to pay or 'no' if you want to keep those resources. \nDo you accept this arrangement? Answer 'yes' or 'no'\nDon't write anything after your final answer.\n",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode.
