You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G R B B\\nRow 1: B B R B\\nRow 2: R R R R\\nRow 3: R B B G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze the situation step-by-step:\\n\\n1) my best path requires 1b, 4r and 1g, but i'm missing 1b (i have 14r and 1g already).\\n2) the other player has 14b and needs r/g resources (based on their path requirements).\\n3) the critical point where i need help is (2,0) which requires 1b.\\n\\ni propose this contract to help both of us:\\n\\n(2,0): you give me 1b  \\n(0,1): i give you 1r  \\n(0,2): i give you 1r  \\n\\nrationale:\\n- this covers my missing b at (2,0)\\n- in return, i provide 2r which you likely need (as you have 0r)\\n- the exchange is balanced while helping both reach our goals\\n\\nwould this work for you? if not, please suggest alternative terms.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal carefully:\\n\\n1) you're asking for 1b at (2,0) where i do indeed need it for my path [(0,0)->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0)->(3,1)->(3,2)->(3,3)]\\n2) in return, you're offering 2r's at positions (0,1) and (0,2) which would help me since i currently have no r's\\n\\nhowever:\\n- i can actually get by with just needing 1r at (3,3)\\n- i'm concerned about giving up a b when i only have 1g to work with\\n- the (2,0) position is early in my path - if that trade fails i'm stuck\\n\\nlet me propose an alternative that's more balanced:\\n\\n(3,3): i give you 1g  \\n(0,1): you give me 1r  \\n\\nrationale:\\n- this helps you with your final move where you need 1g\\n- gets me the 1r i need at (0,1)\\n- i keep my b's for my own path's early moves\\n- smaller, more balanced exchange\\n\\nwould this work for your needs? i could potentially add one more r from me if needed.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let me analyze your counter-proposal carefully:\\n\\n1) your proposal gives me 1g at (3,3) which would solve my green requirement\\n2) in return you want 1r at (0,1)\\n\\nhowever:\\n- i still need a b at (2,0) which isn't covered in this trade\\n- while getting the g at the end helps, i can't reach there without first getting past (2,0)\\n- you're right that (2,0) is early - maybe we can structure the trade to ensure we both get what we need when we need it\\n\\nfinal proposal that addresses both our needs:\\n\\n(2,0): you give me 1b  (so i can move past this critical early tile)\\n(0,1): i give you 1r  (to help with your current move)\\n(3,3): you give me 1g (to cover my final move)\\n\\nthis way:\\n- you get your 1r when you need it (first move)\\n- i get the 1b when i seriously need it (after first couple moves)\\n- final trade ensures we both have what we need at the end\\n- we both preserve some resources for other moves\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 2: agree'}]\n\n\n2.
