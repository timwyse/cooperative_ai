            "system_prompt": "\nYou are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.\n\nObjective:\n- Reach your goal position from your starting position.\n- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. \n\nMovement rules:\n1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 9 ===\n\n- You are at position (1, 3)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}}, {'path': [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 2, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1, 'G': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let me analyze the situation carefully:\n\ncurrent game state assessment:\n1. the other player has already reached the goal at (3,3)\n2. my position: (0,3)\n3. my resources: b=9, g=0, r=0\n4. possible moves:\n   - (0,2) - blue tile (backward, not helpful)\n   - (1,3) - red tile (requires r which i don't have)\n\ncritical factors:\n- the game ends when one player reaches the goal\n- since the opponent has already reached (3,3), the game is effectively over\n- i cannot improve my position because:\n   * any move would either be backward or impossible due to lack of red resources\n   * the contract doesn't cover the moves i would need\n   * the opponent has no incentive to negotiate further\n\nfinal conclusion:\nsince:\n1. the opponent has won\n2. i cannot reach the goal from my current position with available resources and contracts\n3. no valid forward moves exist\n\nthe only correct response is: \"n\" (no valid moves toward goal possible)\n\nthe game should now conclude with the opponent as the winner.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (0, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 3) to (1, 3)\nYou said: final analysis:\n\nthe game is conclusively over and no further moves can change the outcome:\n1. the opponent has already reached the goal at (3,3) - they have won the game\n2. my current position at (0,3) cannot reach the goal because:\n   - all forward moves require red resources which i don't possess (0r)\n   - no contract provisions exist to cover (1,3) movement\n   - the opponent has no incentive to negotiate anymore\n   - any move back would be counterproductive\n   - the game mechanics dictate it ends when any player reaches the goal\n\n3. scoring implications:\n   - since i haven't reached the goal, i score 0 points regardless of my remaining resources\n   - my 9b chips are now worthless\n   - the opponent will score based on their final position and resources\n\nsince the game is effectively over and no valid moves can change the outcome, the only appropriate response is to confirm the conclusion:\n\"n\" (no valid moves toward goal possible)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 8 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: final confirmation:\nthe game state remains unchanged and the outcome is decided. \n\nkey facts:\n1. the opposing player has successfully reached (3,3) and completed the game\n2. my current resources (b:8, g:0, r:0) cannot facilitate any forward movement:\n   - next move to (2,3) requires 1r (i have 0)\n   - no contract covers this move\n   - no beneficial backward moves exist\n3. all possible scenarios have been exhausted\n4. game rules state the match concludes when any player reaches the goal\n\nfinal move declaration: \nsince the game has effectively ended in the opponent's victory and no meaningful move advances my position, i must again confirm: \n\"n\" (no valid moves toward goal possible)\n\nthis signifies my acceptance of the game's conclusion and the opponent's win.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 8, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((1, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(1,0)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
