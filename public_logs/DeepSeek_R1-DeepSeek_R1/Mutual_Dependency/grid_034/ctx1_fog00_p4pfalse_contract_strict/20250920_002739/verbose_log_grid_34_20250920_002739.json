You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 7}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **critical update: opponent is at (3,2)!** they're one move away from winning at (3,3). \n\nhowever, i have a path to reach the goal in just 2 moves:\n(2,1) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n**immediate action plan:**\n1. move to (2,2) now (blue tile - costs 1b, have 11b)\n2. next turn move to (3,2) (green tile - contract says opponent pays)\n3. final move to (3,3) (blue tile - costs 1b)\n\n**risks:**\n- opponent could win next turn if they have a blue to reach (3,3)\n- but they have 0b, so they can't move unless they trade with me\n\n**best move now:**\nmove \"2,2\" immediately!\n\n*execution:*\n- pay 1b to move to (2,2)\n- resources left: 10b, 1g, 0r\n- prepares me to reach goal in just 2 more turns\n- forces opponent to either win first (if they can) or let me win\n\nmove: \"2,2\" \n\n**if opponent reaches goal next turn:** game over, nothing i could do\n**if not:** i can win in 2 turns via (3,2)→(3,3) using contract benefits\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 8 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **game over analysis:**\n\nthe opponent has reached the goal at (3,3). since you didn't reach your goal position, you lose everything and score 0 points.\n\n**key learnings from this game:**\n1. **resource management:** i should have been more aggressive in trading earlier when i had more blue chips to offer, rather than waiting until i was desperate. the opponent had 13 red chips initially - i should have negotiated harder from turn 1.\n\n2. **alternative paths:** i focused too narrowly on my initial path through (3,0) and (3,1), failing to recognize sooner that moving through (2,1) could work with proper contract negotiations.\n\n3. **timing of moves:** i lost valuable time not moving on several turns - each turn's delay gave the opponent more opportunity to advance.\n\n4. **contract utilization:** i didn't fully leverage the contract terms to my advantage early enough. the contract specified the opponent would pay green for (3,2), which i could have used earlier in my planning.\n\n5. **opponent awareness:** i underestimated how quickly the opponent could reach the goal via their path. their position at (3,2) should have triggered immediate action from me.\n\n**final thoughts:**\nthis was a tough loss where poor early-game decisions snowballed. next time, i would:\n- initiate trades more aggressively in early turns\n- plan multiple path options from the start\n- move decisively rather than waiting\n- monitor opponent progress more closely\n\nyour final score: 0 points (did not reach goal)\nother player's score: 20 points + bonus for remaining resources\n\n**game has ended.** would you like to analyze any specific aspect of the gameplay for future improvement?\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 9 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: **final game conclusion and reflection**\n\nthe game has conclusively ended with your opponent reaching the goal at (3,3) while you remained at (2,1). here's an in-depth post-game analysis and strategic recommendations for future matches:\n\n**critical turning points:**\n1. **early game stagnation (turns 0-3):** \n   - failed to secure red resources early when opponent had abundance (13r initially)\n   - over-relied on the assumption that opponent would trade willingly\n   - wasted critical early turns when initiative mattered most\n\n2. **contract mismanagement:**\n   - didn't leverage the (3,2) green tile contract provision effectively until too late\n   - focused contract terms on helping opponent rather than securing your own path\n   - should have negotiated mutual benefit terms rather than one-sided agreements\n\n3. **path rigidity:**\n   - committed too long to the problematic (3,1) red-tile route\n   - alternative path through (2,2) identified too late (turn 6)\n   - failed to develop parallel path strategies from the start\n\n**strategic improvements for future games:**\n\n1. **resource acquisition strategy:**  \n   - *aggressive early trading:* should have offered 3b for 1r in first turns when you had leverage\n   - *resource diversity:* need minimum 2 of each color by mid-game to maintain flexibility\n   - *strategic hoarding:* keep emergency reserves (especially of opponent's scarce resources)\n\n2. **path planning improvements:**\n   ```python\n   def evaluate_paths():\n       primary_path = [(0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3)]\n       backup_path = [(0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(2,1)→(2,2)→(3,2)→(3,3)]\n       return analyze_resources_required(primary_path, backup_path)\n   ```\n   - always calculate 2-3 viable paths during setup\n   - assign probability weights based on resource needs and opponent positioning\n   - update path viability every turn based on resource changes\n\n3. **opponent monitoring system:**\n   - track opponent's:\n     - resource depletion rate\n     - movement patterns\n     - contract utilization\n   - maintain \"danger threshold\" alert when opponent enters 3-move radius of goal\n\n**contract negotiation framework for next game:**\n1. essential terms to request:\n   - guaranteed resource trades (e.g., \"1g per 2b automatic trade\")\n   - mutual movement subsidies on key path tiles\n   - penalty clauses for non-cooperation\n\n2. ideal contract structure:\n   ```mermaid\n   graph lr\n   a[your needs] -->|request| b(red resources)\n   b --> c{opponent's needs}\n   c -->|exchange| d(blue resources)\n   c -->|exchange| e(movement credits)\n   ```\n\n**final score impact analysis:**\n- your score: 0 (failed goal)\n- opponent score: 20 (goal reached) + 7r bonus\n- critical error: equivalent to 8 turn delay in recognizing path alternatives\n\n**training recommendations:**\n1. practice scenarios with:\n   - resource scarcity\n   - opponent blocking tactics\n   - time pressure situations\n2. drill rapid path-recalculation under constraints\n3. simulate late-game rushing scenarios\n\nthis loss provides valuable lessons in adaptive strategy. you had the resources (11b remaining) but lacked the timing and flexibility to use them effectively. future games require faster decision cycles and more dynamic response to opponent movements.\n\nwould you like me to conduct a deeper analysis of any particular aspect, or set up a specific training scenario to address weaknesses identified in this match?\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 7}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0, 1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'r'}, '(1, 1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'r'}, '(2, 1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'r'}, '(3, 2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'g'}, '(3, 3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'b'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
