You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n\nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement. \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \nIn 'pay for other' mode, any resources you have promised to give to other players as part of trade agreements are still counted as your resources (and hence potential contributors to your final score) until you actually give them away.\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
