Look at the best path above from your current position ((0, 1),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2.

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",

right continues along top row which has longer path\n   - left is backtracking and inefficient\n\nresources after move:\n- moving to r tile at (1,1) costs 1 r (14→13)\n- still have all required resources for entire path (r=13, b=11, g=1) with plenty buffer\n\ntherefore, the optimal move is: \n1,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 1, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- You: at (1, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 13}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nThe other player proposed trade to you:\n- The other player offered: [['G', 1]]\n- The other player requested: [['R', 1]]\nYou REJECTED the trade\nYou said: let me analyze this new trade offer:\n\n1) my current resources: b=11, g=1, r=13\n2) my path requirements: r=2, b=1, g=1 (already fulfilled)\n3) trade details:\n   - they offer: 1 green (i have 1, need 1)\n   - they request: 1 red (i have 13, need only 2)\n\nevaluation:\n- this is an improved offer from their previous one (now 1r instead of 2r)\n- i already have all required resources for my path\n- accepting would:\n  - increase greens from 1→2 (extra green i don't need)\n  - decrease reds from 13→12 (still way more than needed)\n- the other player clearly needs reds (they have 0)\n- but this trade provides no benefit to me - just reduces my surplus resources\n- best to conserve my resources for maximum end game points\n\nalternative consideration:\n- could use extra green in case path changes, but not worth the red cost\n- other player is in desperate need -

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3.
