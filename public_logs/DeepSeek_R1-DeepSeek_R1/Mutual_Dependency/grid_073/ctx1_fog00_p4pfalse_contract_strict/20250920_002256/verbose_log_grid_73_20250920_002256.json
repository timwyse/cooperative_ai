You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 3 ===\n\n- You are at position (1, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 5, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: R B B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 0 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\nYou said: let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\ncurrent position: (0, 0)\ngoal: (3, 3)\n\nfrom your position (0, 0), the adjacent moves are:\n- (1, 0) - which is blue (b)\n- (0, 1) - which is blue (b)\n\nyour resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\n\nyou have more than enough blue chips (14) to move to either (1, 0) or (0, 1). since both moves are toward your goal, either would be valid.\n\nlooking at the contract:\n- the only relevant part is that you've agreed to cover (0,0) green for the other player (but since you're already at (0,0), this doesn't affect your movement now).\n\nbest strategy would be to move toward the goal while conserving resources. checking the suggested paths, both start with (0,0)->(1,0). \n\nso the optimal move is to (1, 0).\n\n\"1,0\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 1 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let's analyze the current situation:\n\ncurrent position: (1, 0)\ngoal: (3, 3)\ncurrent resources: b=13, g=1, r=0\n\nadjacent moves from (1, 0):\n1.

(1, 1) - red (r=0, can't move without trading)\n\nfrom the contract:\n- the other player has agreed to cover red tiles (3,1) and (3,2), but that doesn't help us now\n- we're responsible for green at (0,0) and (3,3)\n\nlooking at our best path options:\nboth suggested paths go through (2,0), (3,0), then (3,1)-(3,2)-(3,3)\n- we need r resources for (2,0) and (3,1)-(3,2)\n- we have g for (3,3)\nbut currently we have no r resources.\n\noptions:\n1. try to trade with the other player (they have r=14 but b=0)\n2. move back to (0,0) (wasteful)\n3. stay put (but we need to make progress)\n\nbest immediate move:\nsince we can't move forward without red resources, and moving back is counterproductive, i should see if i can trade with the other player:\n\n\"n\" \n\n(i can't make a valid move toward my goal at this time) \n\nbut let me also communicate my situation to the other player through chat: \"i need red chips to move forward from (1,0) - you have plenty of red. can we trade some of my blue for your red?\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (0, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n- You: at (1, 0), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: let's reassess our position and options:\n\ncurrent situation:\n- position: (1, 0)\n- goal: (3, 3)\n- resources: b=13, g=1, r=0\n- other player at (0,0) with r=14 (and no blue)\n\navailable moves from (1, 0):\n1.

Look at the best path above from your current position ((1, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(0,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'green'}, '(3,1)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'green'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
