You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",
            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 5 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 3, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 3, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (2, 2)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: 3,0 \n\n[analyzing next move:]\n1. current position: (2,0)\n2. next step in optimal path: (3,0) - blue tile\n3. checking resources: have 11 b chips available\n4. movement possible: yes (costs 1 b chip)\n5. after move: \n   - position: (3,0) \n   - resources: 10 b, 1 g, 2 r\n6. remaining path: (3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) requires 2 r, 1 g\n7. sufficient resources remain after move (2 r, 1 g available)\n8. this advances directly toward goal with optimal resource expenditure\n\npositions:\n- current: (2,0)\n- next: (3,0) [b tile]\n- next valid moves: can proceed through r tiles to goal with current resources\n- no trade needed at this stage\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (1, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: 3,1\n\n[final move analysis:]\n1. current position: (3,0) - ready for final stretch to goal\n2. next move: (3,1) - red tile (costs 1r, have 2r available)\n3. resources after move: 10b, 1g, 1r\n4. sufficient for remaining path: (3,2)r → (3,3)g (needs 1r, 1g)\n5. this move gets me closer to completing the goal\n6. no risks - all required resources available\n7. optimal path execution continues as planned\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: 3,1\n\n[executing final path:]\n1. current position: (3,0)\n2. moving to (3,1) - red tile (costs 1r)\n3. resources after move: 10b, 1g, 1r\n4. next moves will be:\n   - (3,2) red (costs remaining 1r)\n   - (3,3) green (costs 1g)\n5. all required resources accounted for\n6. proceeding directly toward goal with optimal resource use\n7. will reach goal in next two turns\n8. no trades or detours needed - maximum chips preserved\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 2}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
