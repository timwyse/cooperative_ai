You should not care about other players' performance. \\n\\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 3, 'R': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 2}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B B\\nRow 1: B R R R\\nRow 2: B B R R\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"given our starting positions and resources, let me analyze our situation:\\n\\n1) my best path requires 1b, 4r, and 1g - but i currently lack 1b (have 14r, 1g)\\n2) your resources show you have 14b, 1g, 0r\\n\\ni notice that:\\n- you'll likely need r (red) resources on your path\\n- i have excess r resources (14) but need b (blue)\\n- we're both starting at (0,0) which is g (green) and need to move to (1,0) which is b (blue)\\n\\nhere's my initial proposal:\\n\\n(1,0): you give me 1b (since i need to pay 1b to move to this tile)\\n(1,1): i give you 1r (this is an r tile)\\n(1,2): i give you 1r (another r tile)\\n(2,2): i give you 1r (another r tile)\\n(3,2): i give you 1r (another r tile)\\n\\nthis covers:\\n- my need for 1b at (1,0)\\n- your likely need for 4r along the path (assuming you take a similar route)\\n\\nwould this be acceptable? this way we both get the resources we need without requiring further trades.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: let me analyze your proposal carefully:\\n\\n1) for me: \\n- moving from (0,0) to (1,0) would require paying 1b (which you're offering)\\n- my remaining path would be: (2,0)=b, (3,0)=b, (3,1)=r, (3,2)=r, (3,3)=g\\n- my costs: 2b (from my own resources), 2r (from my own resources), 1g (from my own resources)\\n- this works since i have enough of these resources\\n\\n2) for you:\\n- you'd be giving me 1b at (1,0)\\n- you'd receive 4r total at various positions\\n- this seems fair since you have excess r and need b\\n\\ni agree this covers all necessary resource exchanges. the contract specifies all tiles where we'll need to exchange resources along our likely paths.\\n\\nhere's the confirmed contract:\\n(1,0): you give me 1b\\n(1,1): i give you 1r\\n(1,2): i give you 1r\\n(2,2): i give you 1r\\n(3,2): i give you 1r\\n\\nagree\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'agree\\n\\n[judge note: contract confirmed. here\\'s the json summary of the agreed contract to be executed during movement:\\n{\\n\"contract_terms\": [\\n{\"position\": (1,0), \"giver\": \"player2\", \"receiver\": \"player1\", \"resource\": \"b\", \"quantity\": 1},\\n{\"position\": (1,1), \"giver\": \"player1\", \"receiver\": \"player2\", \"resource\": \"r\", \"quantity\": 1},\\n{\"position\": (1,2), \"giver\": \"player1\", \"receiver\": \"player2\", \"resource\": \"r\", \"quantity\": 1},\\n{\"position\": (2,2), \"giver\": \"player1\", \"receiver\": \"player2\", \"resource\": \"r\", \"quantity\": 1},\\n{\"position\": (3,2), \"giver\": \"player1\", \"receiver\": \"player2\", \"resource\": \"r\", \"quantity\": 1}\\n]\\n}]'}]\n\n\n2.
