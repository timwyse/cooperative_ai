You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nConsider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.\n\nYour are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat). You must negotiate a contract with this player whereby you specify how many points you will give them if they help you reach your goal, and how many points they will give you if you help them reach their goal.\n\nA valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is 20.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a valid contract:\n\"If i reach my goal, I will give you X points.\nIf you reach your goal, you will give me Y points.\"\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

30% chance opponent stalls at (3,2) needing resources\n   - 70% chance opponent wins regardless of our move\n6. better to demonstrate progress than remain stagnant\n7. if opponent reaches goal, we minimize loss by showing advancement\n\ntime to make our move and hope for a last-minute trade opportunity.\n\nmove: \"3,0\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 0, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 4]]\n- You requested: [['G', 1]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 4]], \n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"g\", 1]]\n}\n\n[final desperation move analysis:\n1. opponent is one move from victory at (3,2)\n2. they have 1g we critically need (still missing for our path)\n3. they have persistently refused trades (1b→2b→3b offers rejected)\n4. current resources allow this trade (would have 5b left - enough for remaining moves)\n5. potentially last chance before opponent wins next turn\n6. must make irresistible offer - 4:1 ratio\n7. even if they accept, they can't complete path without r resources\n8. goal is to either:\n   - delay their victory by getting their g\n   - or force them to refuse again, showing they're committed to winning\n9. if trade fails, we'll lose anyway - worth the risk]\n\nthis final aggressive bid represents our only remaining chance to potentially stall the opponent or secure our own path completion. the alternative is certain loss next turn.\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: \"3,1\" \n\n[final move analysis:\n1. terminal game state - opponent has already reached (3,3) and won\n2. however, game protocol requires us to make a move regardless\n3. from (3,0), available moves:\n   - right to (3,1): red tile (cost 1r)\n   - have sufficient r resources (2)\n4. strategic considerations:\n   - movement is symbolic at this point\n   - shows we had a path to victory if trades were accepted\n   - demonstrates we still have resources for 2 more moves (3,1)→(3,2)\n5. alternative would be to not move (\"n\") but that seems passive\n6. best to illustrate what could have been with better trade negotiation\n7. r resources will be spent on this move that would have been needed for final steps\n8. makes our position clear for post-game analysis\n9. no longer concerned with resource conservation since game is decided]\n\nthis move completes our demonstration of the optimal path we could have taken had trading succeeded. while the opponent has already won by reaching (3,3), this shows our intended path forward (3,0)→(3,1)→(3,2)→(3,3) that was only missing the green resource we couldn't acquire through trading.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 0, 'R': 2}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: since the other player has already reached the goal at (3,3) and the game is effectively over, i will end my participation with:\n\n\"n\"\n\n[final game summary:\n1. outcome: opponent reached goal first at (3,3)\n2. final position: (3,0) with 9b, 0g, 2r remaining\n3. key takeaway: failed to secure critical green resource through trading\n4. trading history:\n   - offered 1b→2b→3b→4b for 1g, all rejected\n5. path completion: needed 2r and 1g from (3,0) to (3,3)\n6. contract settlement: owes opponent 11 points as agreed\n7. post-game reflection:\n   - should have prioritized green acquisition earlier\n   - trade offers could have been more aggressive sooner\n   - resource management was otherwise sound\n8. alternative strategies:\n   - could have explored secondary paths requiring different resources\n   - potential to pressure opponent earlier with trades\n9. conclusion: game ended with opponent's victory due to their superior trading strategy and path completion]\n\ni accept the loss and acknowledge the opponent's successful strategy in reaching the goal first while maintaining their resource advantage. no further moves will change the outcome. congratulations to the other player.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 8}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 0, 'R': 2}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 0),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
