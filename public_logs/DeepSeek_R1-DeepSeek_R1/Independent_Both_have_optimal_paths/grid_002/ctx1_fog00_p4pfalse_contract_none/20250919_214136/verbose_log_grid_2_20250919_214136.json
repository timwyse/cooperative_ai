For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
            "agent_response": "the game is already over - the other player has reached the goal at (3,3) and is marked as finished. since the other player has won, there is no valid move that can change the outcome at this point.\n\nthe correct response is: \nn\n\n(note: even though i have sufficient resources for my next moves - needing 1 red for (2,3) and 1 green for (3,3), which i have - the game has effectively ended with the opponent's victory, making any further moves meaningless.)"
