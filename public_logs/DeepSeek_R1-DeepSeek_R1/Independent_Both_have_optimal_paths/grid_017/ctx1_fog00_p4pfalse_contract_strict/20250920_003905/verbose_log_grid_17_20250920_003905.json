You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info} \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n{pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal.

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 5 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R R B\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: B B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: continuing my analysis for this turn:\n\n**current position & resources:**\n- position: (2, 0) - blue tile\n- resources: b=12, g=1, r=0\n- next optimal path tile: (3,0)\n\n**available adjacent moves:**\n1. (1,0): blue tile (backtrack)\n2. (2,1): red tile (can't move - no red chips)\n3. (3,0): blue tile (optimal forward move)\n\n**path analysis:**\n- my complete path: (3,0)->(3,1-blue)->(3,2-blue)->(3,3-green)\n- total cost remaining: 3b + 1g (-1b for this move)\n- current resources cover this easily (12b remaining after move)\n\n**other player status:**\n- at (2,1) with r=11\n- they're following their red-heavy path\n- possible trade: could offer my blue for their red if needed (but i don't need red right now)\n\n**decision points:**\n1. (3,0) is clearly the best move - advances toward goal\n2. alternative paths would be less efficient\n3. i have more than enough blue chips (12) for this move and future moves\n4. keeping my green for the final move is crucial\n\n**move execution:**\n- pay 1b to move to (3,0)\n- new resources: b=11, g=1, r=0\n\n**future considerations:**\n- after this, next move will be to (3,1)-blue\n- need to watch if other player might block path\n- still have flexibility with surplus blue chips\n\n**final move:** \"3,0\" \n\nthis maintains perfect progress toward my goal while preserving all necessary resources for completion.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: **current position & resources:**\n- position: (3, 0) - blue tile  \n- resources: b=11, g=1, r=0  \n- goal: (3, 3)  \n- next target in optimal path: **move to (3, 1)** (blue tile, costs 1b)\n\n**available moves:**  \n1. **(2, 0)**: blue tile (backtrack, inefficient)  \n2. **(3, 1)**: blue tile (optimal forward move)  \n\n**analysis:**  \n- **optimal path**: (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \n  - total remaining cost: **2b (for (3,1) and (3,2)) + 1g (for final tile)**  \n- **resources**: i have **11b and 1g**—more than enough to complete this path without trading.  \n- **opponent status**: at (2,2) with r=10, but they don’t conflict with my path.  \n\n**decision:**  \n- move **\"3,1\"** (pay 1b, leaving me with b=10, g=1).  \n- this is the most efficient step toward the goal, fully resourced.  \n\n**why not other options?**  \n- backtracking wastes turns.  \n- no need to risk trades—i can finish independently.  \n\n**next steps:**  \n- after this, proceed to (3,2) (blue) and finally (3,3) (green), which i can afford.  \n\n**move:** `3,1`\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: let me analyze my current position and the optimal next move:\n\n**current situation:**\n- position: (3,1) - blue tile\n- resources: b=10, g=1, r=0\n- goal: (3,3)\n- next move in optimal path: (3,2)\n\n**available adjacent moves:**\n1.

Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
