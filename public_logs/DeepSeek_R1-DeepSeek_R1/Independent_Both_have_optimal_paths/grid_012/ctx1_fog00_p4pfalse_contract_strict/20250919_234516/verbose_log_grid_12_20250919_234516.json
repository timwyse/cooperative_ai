            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 8 ===\n\n- You are at position (2, 3)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (0, 3) to (1, 3)\nYou said: let me reassess the situation carefully:\n\n1. **game status update**:\n   - the other player has reached the goal at (3,3) on their last turn\n   - this means the contract clause for (3,3) is now void (since they've completed the game)\n   - i'm still at (0,3) with resources: 11b, 1g, 0r\n\n2. **current path options**:\n   - best path remains: (0,3)→(1,3)→(2,3)→(3,3)\n   - however, critical changes:\n     - (3,3) green: now i must pay myself (contract no longer applies)\n     - (1,3) and (2,3) red tiles: contract still applies (other player pays)\n\n3. **resource check**:\n   - (1,3): red - contract covers (other player pays)\n   - (2,3): red - contract covers (other player has 9r left)\n   - (3,3): green - i need to pay 1g (i have exactly 1g)\n\n4. **strategically**:\n   - i can still complete the path using:\n     1. (1,3): free (contract)\n     2. (2,3): free (contract)\n     3. (3,3): pay 1g myself\n   - i have the exact resources needed (1g) for the final move\n   - contract still valid for red tiles (other player must honor until i reach goal)\n\n**critical observation**:\nthe other player has reached the goal, but our contract remains active for tiles (1,3) and (2,3) until i use them or complete the game.\n\n**best move**: \"1,3\"\n- takes me toward the goal\n- uses free contract move (other player pays 1r)\n- preserves my own resources\n- sets me up to complete the game with my 1g\n\nno need to deviate - i can still reach the goal in 3 moves using the contract where possible.\n\nmove: \"1,3\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: time to complete the final steps to victory! let's analyze:\n\n**current position & resources:**\n- at (1,3) - red tile (just moved here using the contract, other player paid)\n- resources: 10b, 1g, 0r\n- contract still active for: (2,3) red tile\n- goal at (3,3) - green tile (must pay myself since other player has finished)\n\n**available moves:**\n1. (0,3): blue - costs 1b (backwards)\n2. (1,2): red - contract applies (other player pays) but off-path\n3. **(2,3): red - contract applies + on optimal path**\n4. (1,4): invalid\n\n**optimal path forward:**\n(1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)\n- next step: (2,3) - red (contract covers)\n- then: (3,3) - green (pay 1g from my own resources)\n\n**strategic advantage:**\n- can reach goal in 2 moves with:\n  - (2,3): free (contract covers using other player's 9r remaining)\n  - (3,3): pay my 1g\n- other player must still honor contract for (2,3) even though they've finished\n- maintains all my blue chips for maximum end-game scoring\n\n**action: \"2,3\"**\n\nthis:\n1. uses contract benefit for red tile move\n2. preserves my resources\n3. puts me one move away from goal\n4. sets up final green move with my 1g chip\n\nafter this, i'll be positioned to make the final move to (3,3) on the next turn. the other player has already finished, so i should move quickly to complete my own path and maximize my remaining chips for scoring.\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 10, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 7 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3)\nYou said: let me reassess and make sure we execute the optimal move:\n\n**current situation:**\n- position: (1,3) - red tile (contract covered)\n- resources: 10b, 1g, 0r\n- other player status: finished at (3,3), with 9r remaining\n- contract remains active for red tiles on my path\n- next optimal move: (2,3) - red tile\n\n**move analysis:**\n1. (2,3) is red - covered by contract (they pay 1r from their 9r)\n2. this maintains our efficient path to victory\n3. then final move to (3,3) costs my 1g (i have exactly 1g)\n4. other moves:\n   - (0,3) would be backward (1b cost, waste of resources)\n   - (1,2) is off-path (and also red)\n\n**critical points:**\n- the other player must still honor the contract even though they finished\n- contract remains in effect until i reach the goal or the game ends\n- i'll reach the goal next turn if i move to (2,3) now\n- my resources are perfectly aligned for final move (just need 1g remaining)\n\n**decision:**\n\"2,3\" is the optimal move because:\n1. uses contract benefit (other player pays)\n2. takes me directly toward goal\n3. preserves my resources\n4. sets up final move to win next turn\n\n**execution:**\nmoving to \"2,3\" now, which will leave me with:\n- position: (2,3)\n- resources unchanged (10b, 1g, 0r)\n- then final move to (3,3) on next turn using my 1g\n\nmove: \"2,3\"\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((2, 3),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \n\n   \nYou have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When you try to move onto one of the tiles for which they have agreed to pay on your behalf, the resource will leave their resources and you will be able to move onto that tile:\n{'(1,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,0)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,1)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(2,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(3,2)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'red'}, '(0,3)': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'color': 'blue'}, '(3,3)': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'green'}}\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
