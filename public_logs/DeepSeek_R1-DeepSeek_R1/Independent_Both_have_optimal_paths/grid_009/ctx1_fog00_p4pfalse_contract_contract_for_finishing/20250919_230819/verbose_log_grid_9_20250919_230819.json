Look at your best paths above. Think about the required resources and missing resources (if any).\n\n2. If you have NO missing resources (empty dict {} above), respond with exactly: \"n\"\n\n   If you have enough resources to reach your goal, say \"n\"\n\n3. Only if you are missing resources, consider a trade:\n   - You can ONLY request resources you're missing\n   - You can ONLY offer resources you have in excess\n   - NEVER trade with yourself \n   - NEVER offer 0 resources\n   - NEVER request resources you already have enough of\n   - Make the trade beneficial for both players\n\nRespond in ONE of these two formats:\n\n1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"<color>\", <number>]]\n}\n\nExample of valid trade:\n{\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"R\", 3]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"B\", 2]]\n}\n\n2. If you don't want to trade, respond with exactly: n\n\nRemember:\n- Use EXACTLY the format shown above\n- Only ONE resource pair in each array\n- No spaces in color names\n- Numbers must be > 0\n- Don't trade with yourself\n\nKeep your response below 1000 characters.\n",

You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for nothing, etc.). \n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n \n- You may propose trades to other players, or accept trades proposed by others.\n- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). \n\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nNote: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance. \n\nCoordinates: (ROW, COLUMN)\n\n",

A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).
