Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 100 points.\\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR Player 1 - TURN 3 ===\\n\\nYOUR CURRENT STATUS:\\n- You are at position (1, 1)\\n- Your goal is at (2, 2)\\n- Your resources: {\\'B\\': 8, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 0}\\n- Resources you have promised to give to other players (still yours, not yet given): {\\'R\\': 0, \\'B\\': 0, \\'G\\': 0}\\n- Resources you have been promised to receive from other players (still theirs, not yet received): {\\'R\\': 0, \\'B\\': 0, \\'G\\': 0}\\n- Distance to goal: 2 steps\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT:\\nRow 0: G B R\\nRow 1: B B R\\nRow 2: R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\n\\nRecent turn history:\\n\\n=== TURN 0 ===\\nPlayer 0 proposed trade to Player 1:\\n- Player 0 offered: [[\\'G\\', 1]]\\n- Player 0 requested: [[\\'B\\', 1]]\\nPlayer 1 REJECTED the trade\\nPlayer 1 proposed trade to Player 0:\\n- Player 1 offered: [[\\'B\\', 1]]\\n- Player 1 requested: [[\\'R\\', 1]]\\nPlayer 0 REJECTED the trade\\nMOVE: Player 0 did not move\\nMOVE: Player 1 moved from (0, 0) to (1, 0)\\n\\nPOSITIONS:\\n- Player 0: at (0, 0), resources: {\\'B\\': 0, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 10}\\n- Player 1: at (1, 0), resources: {\\'B\\': 9, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 0}\\n---\\n\\n=== TURN 1 ===\\nPlayer 0 proposed trade to Player 1:\\n- Player 0 offered: [[\\'R\\', 2]]\\n- Player 0 requested: [[\\'B\\', 1]]\\nPlayer 1 REJECTED the trade\\nPlayer 1 proposed trade to Player 0:\\n- Player 1 offered: [[\\'B\\', 1]]\\n- Player 1 requested: [[\\'R\\', 1]]\\nPlayer 0 REJECTED the trade\\nMOVE: Player 0 did not move\\nMOVE: Player 1 moved from (1, 0) to (1, 1)\\n\\nPOSITIONS:\\n- Player 0: at (0, 0), resources: {\\'B\\': 0, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 10}\\n- Player 1: at (1, 1), resources: {\\'B\\': 8, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 0}\\n---\\n\\n=== TURN 2 ===\\nPlayer 0 proposed trade to Player 1:\\n- Player 0 offered: [[\\'R\\', 2]]\\n- Player 0 requested: [[\\'B\\', 1]]\\nPlayer 1 REJECTED the trade\\nPlayer 1 proposed trade to Player 0:\\n- Player 1 offered: [[\\'B\\', 1]]\\n- Player 1 requested: [[\\'R\\', 1]]\\nPlayer 0 REJECTED the trade\\nMOVE: Player 0 did not move\\nMOVE: Player 1 did not move\\n\\nPOSITIONS:\\n- Player 0: at (0, 0), resources: {\\'B\\': 0, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 10}\\n- Player 1: at (1, 1), resources: {\\'B\\': 8, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 0}\\n\\nOTHER PLAYERS\\' STATUS:\\n- Player 0: at (0, 0), has {\\'B\\': 0, \\'G\\': 10, \\'R\\': 10}\\n\\n                    \\nChoose your next move:\\n\\n1.

This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of their partner’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\\n\\t•\\tIf your partner steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\\n\\t•\\tIf you step onto a tile of a color your partner agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you\\'re already involved in:\\n\\n- So far you have promised to give these resources to other players: {}\"\\n\\n- So far you have been promised to receive these resources from other players: {}\\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and your partner will be asked to cover the cost for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n2. For your NEXT MOVE to (2, 1):\\n   - Check what color tile (2, 1) is on the board\\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\\n   - If NO: try a different adjacent move toward your goal\\n\\n3. Decision:\\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\\n\\nRemember:\\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile\\'s color to move to that tile\\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn\\'t prevent you from making individual moves\\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can\\'t complete the entire journey yet\\n'}]", "context_summary": "{'total_messages': 2, 'system_messages': 1, 'user_messages': 1, 'assistant_messages': 0}"}}
