A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R B R\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 8]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 8]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nYou proposed trade to the other player:\n- You offered: [['B', 11]]\n- You requested: [['R', 2]]\nYou said: {\n  \"resources_to_offer\": [[\"b\", 11]],\n  \"resources_to_receive\": [[\"r\", 2]]\n}\nThe other player REJECTED the trade\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 6 ===\nMOVE: You did not move\nYou said: n\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
