Also consider whether the trade results in having more resources left over after reaching your goal, and hence a higher score. \nAdditionally, you have agreed upon the following contract with the other player. When either of you reach your goal, you will give them the agreed points:\n{'player_0_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'you', 'receiver': 'the other player', 'amount': 5}, 'player_1_reaches_goal': {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'amount': 5}}.
