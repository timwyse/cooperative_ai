You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: R B B B\nRow 2: R R R R\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(1,0): **needs r** \n  2. (1,1): needs **b** (i have plenty)\n  3. (2,1): **needs r**\n  4. (3,1): needs **b**\n  5. (3,2): needs **b**\n  6. (3,3): needs **g** (i have 1)\n\n- i **lack red entirely**.  \n- you lack blue, but *your shortest (resource-conserving) route doesn’t* require blue—still, you may wish for flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### i want to maximize my points by not giving away blue unless you actually use it, as i get 5 points per resource leftover at the goal.\n\n#### therefore, my counter-proposal:\n\n1. **reds for me only on the tiles i actually step on, and blues for you only if you step there.**\n2. extra flexibility is okay as long as extra commitment (blues) is balanced by equal red commitment.\n\n**proposed contract terms:**\n\n#### for me:\n- (1,0): you give me a red\n- (2,1): you give me a red\n\n*(if you want me to take a different \"red-heavy\" path, specify those tiles and i will follow.)*\n\n#### for you:  \n- (1,1): i give you a blue (if you step there)\n- (3,1): i give you a blue\n- (3,2): i give you a blue\n\n##### if you want insurance on more blue tiles, then for each additional blue commitment you want from me (beyond these 3), i ask for an additional red commitment from you, which i can then use to plan a backup path.\n\n---\n\n**in summary:**\n\n- on your actual path, you will only need blue at (1,1), (3,1), and (3,2), so i offer you coverage there.\n- on my planned path, i only need reds at (1,0) and (2,1)—so you cover those for me.\n- if you want “all blue tiles covered at any time,” i’ll match that with requests for more disruptive insurance reds.\n\n**please confirm if you’re happy with my minimal-intervention contract or if you want larger flexibility (if so, specify which blue locations you want insurance on, and i’ll specify which extra reds i want in reciprocal balance)!**\n\nhere is the basic contract to accept:\n\n- (1,0): you give me a red\n- (2,1): you give me a red\n- (1,1): i give you a blue\n- (3,1): i give you a blue\n- (3,2): i give you a blue\n\nif this is acceptable, reply \"agree,\" or propose modifications if you want broader insurance! \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for your careful counter-proposal and clarification.  \nyour minimal-intervention offer ensures we both preserve our leftover resources for maximum point value, while guaranteeing success.\n\n### contract summary (for explicitness):\n\n- (1,0): i give you a red  \n- (2,1): i give you a red  \n- (1,1): you give me a blue  \n- (3,1): you give me a blue  \n- (3,2): you give me a blue  \n\ni accept these terms, as this secures my route (i don’t need blue on my optimal red-heavy route) and doesn’t commit us to unnecessary exchanges.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: agree \n",
