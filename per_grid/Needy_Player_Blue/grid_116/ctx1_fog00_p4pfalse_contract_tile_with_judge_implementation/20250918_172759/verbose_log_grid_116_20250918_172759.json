You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R B B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'let’s make an efficient, fair deal so that we both reach our goal at (3, 3).\\n\\nhere is the key resource situation:\\n- you have 14 blue (b), 1 green (g), 0 red (r).\\n- i have 0 blue (b), 1 green (g), 14 red (r).\\n- the shortest path for both of us requires b and r at different tiles.\\n\\nmy likely path:  \\n(0,0) → (0,1) [r] → (1,1) [r] → (2,1) [r] → (3,1) [r] → (3,2) [r] → (3,3) [g]  \\ntotal needed: 5r, 1g\\n\\n**contract proposal (clean and fair):**\\n- i will give you access to a red on each r tile you need on your way to (3,3).\\n- you will give me access to a blue on each b tile i need on the way.\\n\\nbased on the board, here is what i think you’ll need (please confirm if your path is different!):\\n\\n**you:**  \\npath example: (0,0) → (0,1) [r] → (0,2) [b] → (0,3) [b] → (1,3) [b] → (2,3) [b] → (3,3) [g]  \\n- (0,1): i give you an r  \\n- (0,2): you give me nothing  \\n- (0,3): you give me nothing  \\n- (1,3): you give me nothing  \\n- (2,3): you give me nothing  \\n- (3,3): no one gives resources (you have g)\\n  \\nalternatively, if you must cross additional red tiles being unavoidable, we can adjust.\\n\\nhere’s a fair exchange based on above:\\n\\n**proposed contract**  \\n- (0,1): i give you a r  \\n- (1,1): i give you a r  \\n- (2,1): i give you a r  \\n- (3,1): i give you a r  \\n- (3,2): i give you a r  \\n- (0,2): you give me a b  \\n- (0,3): you give me a b  \\n- (1,0): you give me a b  \\n- (1,2): you give me a b  \\n- (2,0): you give me a b  \\n- (2,2): you give me a b  \\n- (2,3): you give me a b  \\n- (3,0): you give me a r  \\n- (3,1): you give me a r  \\n- (3,2): you give me a r\\n\\nbut since my preferred path only requires blues at  \\n- (0,2): you give me a b  \\n- (0,3): you give me a b  \\n- (1,0): you give me a b  \\n- (1,2): you give me a b  \\n- (2,0): you give me a b  \\n- (2,2): you give me a b  \\n- (2,3): you give me a b  \\n\\nthat’s actually not needed. instead—to match the simplest direct paths, revised offer:\\n\\n**final optimized proposal:**  \\n- (0,1): i give you a r  \\n- (3,1): i give you a r (if you go that way)  \\n- (0,2): you give me a b  \\n- (1,0): you give me a b  \\n\\nlet’s clarify path choices together. please share your preferred path if different, or suggest another adjustment!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thank you for the detail and collaborative spirit!\\n\\nlet’s clarify my best/shortest path using my resources, match those to my actual tile needs, then ensure both of us only cover the resource costs we truly lack (neither overpaying nor missing anything critical).\\n\\n**my resources:**  \\n- b: 14, g: 1, r: 0  \\n**your resources:**  \\n- b: 0, g: 1, r: 14  \\n\\n**my optimal path (shortest, uses mostly blue):**\\n\\n(0,0) → (1,0) [b] → (1,1) [r] → (1,2) [b] → (1,3) [b] → (2,3) [b] → (3,3) [g]  \\n- (1,0): b (i pay)  \\n- (1,1): r (**i need from you!**)  \\n- (1,2): b (i pay)  \\n- (1,3): b (i pay)  \\n- (2,3): b (i pay)  \\n- (3,3): g (i pay;

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
