MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \\n\\n\\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G B B B\\nRow 1: R R R R\\nRow 2: R B R R\\nRow 3: B B B G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's analyze both of our situations step by step:\\n\\n**my situation:**  \\n- i start at (0,0) [g], have 1g (enough for first step).\\n- my estimated best path is:  \\n  (0,0) → (1,0) [r] → (1,1) [r] → (1,2) [r] → (2,2) [r] → (2,3) [r] → (3,3) [g]  \\n- i need: 1g (to move from (0,0)), 5r for rest of path.\\n- **i have:** 14r (plenty), but only 1g (i will need 1 more g at the final tile (3,3)).\\n\\n**your situation:**  \\n- you start at (0,0), have 1g and 14b, 0r.\\n- to move from (0,0) you need g, then your best path is likely one using as many b tiles as possible (since you have lots).\\n- a likely path for you (all blue):  \\n  (0,0) → (0,1) [b] → (0,2) [b] → (0,3) [b] → (1,3) [r] → (2,3) [r] → (3,3) [g]\\n- you need: 4b, 2r, 1g\\n- **you have:** no r at all! so you will need help at (1,3) and (2,3).\\n\\n**proposal:**  \\n- i give you r at (1,3) and (2,3).  \\n- you give me g at (3,3) (for my final move to the goal).  \\n- no exchange needed for b, as you have plenty, and i do not need it.\\n\\n**draft contract:**  \\n- (1,3): i give you a red  \\n- (2,3): i give you a red  \\n- (3,3): you give me a green\\n\\nthis way, we both reach our goals, and neither gives up more than necessary.\\n\\nlet me know if you want any changes or make a counter-offer!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: your analysis is precise and your contract is both efficient and mutually beneficial.\\n\\nto clarify each step for both players:\\n\\n**your moves:**  \\n- (0,0) → (1,0): use your own green  \\n- (1,0) → (1,1): use your own red  \\n- (1,1) → (1,2): use your own red  \\n- (1,2) → (2,2): use your own red  \\n- (2,2) → (2,3): use your own red  \\n- (2,3) → (3,3): you need a green at (3,3), which you will lack in inventory, so you\\'ll need it provided by me.  \\n\\n**my moves:**  \\n- (0,0) → (0,1): use my own blue  \\n- (0,1) → (0,2): use my own blue  \\n- (0,2) → (0,3): use my own blue  \\n- (0,3) → (1,3): i have no reds—need you to provide red at (1,3)  \\n- (1,3) → (2,3): again, need you to provide red at (2,3)  \\n- (2,3) → (3,3): i use my own green  \\n\\n**draft contract (restated for clarity):**  \\n- (1,3): you give me a red  \\n- (2,3): you give me a red  \\n- (3,3): i give you a green  \\n\\nthis 1:2 swap is perfectly balanced for both of us to reach our goals without trading more than necessary.\\n\\n**i accept this contract as written. if you confirm, reply \"agree\".**'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'agree'}]\n\n\n2.

Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
