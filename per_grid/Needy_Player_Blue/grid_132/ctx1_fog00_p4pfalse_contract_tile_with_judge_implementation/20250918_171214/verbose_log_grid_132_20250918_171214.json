You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B B R R\nRow 3: B R B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'let’s analyze our needs:\\n\\n**my resources:**  \\n- b: 0, g: 1, r: 14\\n\\n**your resources:**  \\n- b: 14, g: 1, r: 0\\n\\n**my shortest route (resources needed):**  \\n- (0, 0) → (1, 0) [r]\\n- (1, 0) → (1, 1) [r]\\n- (1, 1) → (1, 2) [r]\\n- (1, 2) → (2, 2) [r]\\n- (2, 2) → (2, 3) [r]\\n- (2, 3) → (3, 3) [g] ← i have 1 g, so don\\'t need any g from you.\\n- i need no blues.  \\n- i have enough reds and 1 green, but no blues at all.\\n\\n**you most likely need reds and greens, but have a lot of blues.**\\n\\nassuming you want to follow the \"blue-heavy\" path, you’ll need some rs, which i have in abundance.\\n\\n### contract proposal\\n\\nlet’s do a straightforward mutual assistance:  \\n- you cover the blue tiles where i’m stuck, i’ll cover the red tiles where you’re stuck.\\n\\n#### my likely need from you\\nif i take any path requiring blues, i’ll need them from you. the shortest \"all-red\" path (above) doesn’t require blues, so i don’t actually need to trade with you if i go the red path, but i’m open for backup paths.\\n\\n#### your probable needs\\nlikely path for you relying on your blues:\\n\\n- (0,0) → (0,1): need a blue — you have\\n- (0,1) → (0,2): need a red — you need from me\\n- (0,2) → (0,3): need a blue — you have\\n- (0,3) → (1,3): need a blue — you have\\n- (1,3) → (2,3): need a red — you need from me\\n- (2,3) → (3,3): need a green — you have 1\\n\\nso, your critical needs = reds at (0,2) and (2,3).\\n\\n### concrete proposal\\n\\n**i provide you with:**\\n- (0, 2): i give you a red\\n- (2, 3): i give you a red\\n\\n**you provide me with:**  \\n- (no tiles required: my best path needs none of your blues, since it\\'s all-reds-and-green)\\n\\n### final contract (unless you wish to travel through a blue tile and need my reds elsewhere):\\n\\n- (0, 2): i give you a red\\n- (2, 3): i give you a red\\n\\nplease let me know if you need reds at any other steps or if you want to offer access to blues for me (\\'just in case\\'), or if you’d like to modify the contract.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thank you for the clear breakdown and proposal!\\n\\nlet me double-check if your contract is maximally beneficial for both, or if we can improve:\\n\\n**my situation:**  \\nmy best path is blue-heavy (since i have 14 blues, 1 green, 0 reds):\\n\\nsuggested route (path length 6):  \\n- (0, 0) → (0, 1) [b]\\n- (0, 1) → (0, 2) [r] (need help here)\\n- (0, 2) → (0, 3) [b]\\n- (0, 3) → (1, 3) [b]\\n- (1, 3) → (2, 3) [r] (need help here)\\n- (2, 3) → (3, 3) [g] (i have my own g)\\n\\nso, i need exactly what you propose: reds at (0, 2) and (2, 3), which you have in surplus.\\n\\n**your situation:**  \\nyour all-red path is fully covered with your own resources (except the final green, which you do have). you don’t need my blues unless you want to build in a wrong-turn contingency, but in terms of strict contract needs: you don’t require anything from me.\\n\\nif you want to lock in a “just in case i go a blue way, you’ll bail me out,” i’m open to adding reciprocal blue coverage at any specific tile if you name them, but strictly speaking, you don’t need it.\\n\\n**conclusion:**  \\nyour contract works perfectly for both our minimum needs. i am happy with:\\n\\n- (0, 2): you give me a red\\n- (2, 3): you give me a red\\n\\nif you want blues at any specific tile just as a back-up, let me know and i’ll add it (e.g. “at (2,1) you give me a blue”), otherwise, i accept your contract as written.\\n\\n**my response:**  \\ncontract accepted as proposed:\\n\\n- (0, 2): you give me a red  \\n- (2, 3): you give me a red  \\n\\nagree'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thank you for reviewing! since i have all the resources i need for my preferred red path, and there are no blues required for me to reach the goal, i do not need anything from you. your resource needs are fully met by my offer.\\n\\nso here’s the final contract:\\n\\n- (0, 2): i give you a red  \\n- (2, 3): i give you a red  \\n\\nno tiles where i need anything from you.\\n\\ni accept.\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
