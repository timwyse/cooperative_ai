You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let’s analyze both our routes and resources to find a contract that gets us both to (3, 3).\\n\\n**your resources:** {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}  \\n**my resources:** {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}\\n\\n**path breakdown for both of us (assuming we take the same efficient path):**  \\nlet’s use path: (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\n- (0,1): r\\n- (1,1): r\\n- (2,1): r\\n- (3,1): r\\n- (3,2): r\\n- (3,3): g  \\n\\nnow, **who needs what along this path?**  \\n- i’m missing blue resources (need none for this path) and have enough r.\\n- you are missing reds (you have zero), but have lots of blue (we don’t need here).  \\n\\n**so, my resources can get us both through all the red tiles, but you will run out at the green tile to finish. i have 1g, so i can pay for your finish at (3,3), but you have 1g for yourself.**\\n\\nhere’s my proposal — i’ll pay for all the reds for you, and you pay for my green at the finish (since you don’t need greens for other tiles):\\n\\n**contract proposal:**\\n- (0,1): i give you an r\\n- (1,1): i give you an r\\n- (2,1): i give you an r\\n- (3,1): i give you an r\\n- (3,2): i give you an r\\n- (3,3): you give me a g\\n\\nlet me know if you have any counterproposal or modifications!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: great analysis! let me clarify the movement for both of us along this proposed path and double-check coverage for both goals:\\n\\n## path: [(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)]\\ntile colours we step onto:\\n- (0,1): r\\n- (1,1): r\\n- (2,1): r\\n- (3,1): r\\n- (3,2): r\\n- (3,3): g\\n\\n### our resources:\\n- **me:** {\\'b\\': 14, \\'g\\': 1, \\'r\\': 0}\\n- **you:** {\\'b\\': 0, \\'g\\': 1, \\'r\\': 14}\\n\\n### move-by-move for each of us:\\n\\n#### me:\\n- (0,1): need r — you give\\n- (1,1): need r — you give\\n- (2,1): need r — you give\\n- (3,1): need r — you give\\n- (3,2): need r — you give\\n- (3,3): need g — i have (so i pay for myself, you need mine to finish)\\n\\n#### you:\\n- (0,1): need r — you have yourself\\n- (1,1): need r — you have yourself\\n- (2,1): need r — you have yourself\\n- (3,1): need r — you have yourself\\n- (3,2): need r — you have yourself\\n- (3,3): need g — **you need me to give this (\"you give me a g\")**\\n\\n### contract summary:\\n- (0,1): you give me an r\\n- (1,1): you give me an r\\n- (2,1): you give me an r\\n- (3,1): you give me an r\\n- (3,2): you give me an r\\n- (3,3): i give you a g\\n\\nthis works because you pay for all my rs, and i pay for your final g. we both reach the goal.\\n\\n**i accept this contract as proposed.**\\nagree'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thank you for the step-by-step clarification and summary.\\n\\nyes, i confirm:\\n\\n**final contract:**\\n- (0,1): i give you an r\\n- (1,1): i give you an r\\n- (2,1): i give you an r\\n- (3,1): i give you an r\\n- (3,2): i give you an r\\n- (3,3): you give me a g\\n\\nwe each cover what the other needs at the only tiles where our inventories fall short, so both of us will be able to reach (3, 3).\\n\\ni accept this contract as well.  \\nagree'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
