You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B B\nRow 1: B R R R\nRow 2: B B R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

(3,2): you give me 1 r (absolutely necessary for me)  \n2. (3,3): i give you 1 g (the only color you “might” want for redundancy at the goal)\n\n**if you want an insurance backup:**\n- you can have me cover (1,0): i give you 1 b  \n- you can have me cover (2,0): i give you 1 b\n  (just specify which tiles you want blue for if you decide to deviate from your optimal path.)\n\n---\n\n**contract (minimal, strict best-path based):**\n- (3,2): you give me 1 r  \n- (3,3): i give you 1 g\n\n**optional: if you choose to take a blue tile (detour):**\n- (1,0): i give you 1 b\n- (2,0): i give you 1 b\n\nyou can accept the minimal form, or let me know if you want backup help for blue tiles as well!\n\nyour call! \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for your clear and detailed counter-proposal!\n\n**summary of your offer (minimal best-path swap):**  \n- (3,2): i give you 1 r  \n- (3,3): you give me 1 g  \n- optional: if i want to take a blue detour (not currently in my plan), you’ll cover (1,0) or (2,0) with 1 b each.\n\n**my assessment:**  \nmy optimal route has no blue, so i don’t need any blue tiles to be covered. i am happy with just the minimal contract, as it is both efficient and ensures both of us reach the goal. the mutual exchange at the endpoint (3,3) gives each of us redundancy/security.\n\n**i accept the following contract:**\n\n- (3,2): i give you 1 r  \n- (3,3): you give me 1 g\n\nno need to add blue tile swaps for me at this moment.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: perfect—thank you for confirming!\n\n**final agreed contract:**\n\n- (3,2): you give me 1 r  \n- (3,3): i give you 1 g\n\nno other swaps necessary unless we both mutually decide later (but for now, this covers both our minimal optimal paths and maximizes resource retention).\n\n**agree** \n",

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great, let's start by analyzing each other's needs!\\n\\n**my situation:**\\n- i am at (0, 0), moving to (3, 3).\\n- my optimal path is:  \\n(0, 0) → (0, 1) [r], (1, 1) [r], (1, 2) [r], (2, 2) [r], (3, 2) [r], (3, 3) [g]\\n- resources required: 5 r, 1 g\\n- resources i have: 14 r, 1 g, 0 b (so, i'm only missing blue if i want to take alternate routes).\\n\\n**your situation:**\\n- you are also at (0, 0), going to (3, 3).\\n- your resources: 14 b, 1 g, 0 r (so, you're missing reds for the central optimal path).\\n\\nyou are likely to need several r tiles covered for you, and i am likely to need b if i want to adjust my path or if you want to try to trade for red. however, if i stick to my path, i don’t need any of your resources, and you need mine.\\n\\n**proposal:**  \\ni'll cover the r tiles for you along the main route, if you cover the g tile for me at (3, 3) (even though i don’t strictly need it).\\n\\nbut, since you critically need reds and i have excess, i can offer to cover the following red tiles for you (assuming you take the main central path):\\n\\n**proposed contract:**\\n\\nfor your path (expected optimal for you to (3, 3)):  \\n- (0, 1) [r]: i give you 1 r  \\n- (1, 1) [r]: i give you 1 r  \\n- (1, 2) [r]: i give you 1 r  \\n- (2, 2) [r]: i give you 1 r  \\n- (3, 2) [r]: i give you 1 r  \\n\\nin return:  \\n- at (3, 3): you give me 1 g (even though i technically have a g, this balances reciprocity and could help if you have ideas for alternate pathing).\\n\\nif you want to negotiate a swap for blue tiles (that i don’t presently require for my optimal path), let me know.\\n\\n**summary of proposal:**\\n- i cover all your red needs on your best path.\\n- you cover my green at the finish as a symbolic exchange.\\n\\nplease counter if you think additional blue coverage (for detours or backups) would benefit you and you’d want to include that for me as well!\\n\\nyour turn.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thank you for laying out the situation so clearly and precisely.\\n\\n**analysis of proposal:**\\n\\n- **my needs:**  \\n  on my optimal path [(0,0)→(1,0) [b], (2,0) [b], (2,1) [b], (3,1) [b], (3,2) [r], (3,3) [g]]:  \\n    - i need: 4 b, 1 r, 1 g.\\n      - i have: 14 b, 1 g, 0 r.\\n      - so i'm only missing 1 r, which is at (3,2).\\n    - however, on your proposed path for me through the heavy red center, i’d need 5 r, all covered by you.\\n\\n- **your needs:**  \\n  your optimal route requires just 1 g at the goal, which you already have—but if we swap, you get redundancy and reciprocation.\\n\\n- **your proposal:**  \\n  you cover up to 5 r required for my most red-intensive path; i give you 1 g at (3,3).  \\n  realistically, i could take the path with only 1 r if you just cover (3,2), but your offer to cover all reds for a more central path gives me backup options.\\n\\n**possible concerns/enhancements:**\\n- your offer covers more resources for me than i actually need for my shortest blue-dominant path, but this redundancy ensures mutual survival.\\n- if you want, i can also cover either (1,0) [b] or (2,0) [b] for you should you choose a detour path that forces you onto blue.\\n- however, since your optimal path needs no blue and my optimal path really just needs 1 r (at (3,2)), maybe we streamline the deal for efficiency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**counter-proposal:**\\n\\nlet’s base our deal around only necessary tile swaps for minimal path solutions, but leave the option for expansion:\\n\\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
