MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5.

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \\n\\n\\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\\n\\n- You are at position (0, 0)\\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \\n- Your resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\\n\\n\\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 4, 'R': 1, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'R': 1}}]\\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\\n\\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\\n\\nBOARD LAYOUT: \\nRow 0: G R R R\\nRow 1: B B B R\\nRow 2: B B B R\\nRow 3: B R R G\\n\\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\\nThis is the first turn.\\n\\n\\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \\nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\\n\\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"thanks for starting negotiations! here is the situation for both of us step-by-step:\\n\\n**my needs:**  \\n- path: (0,0) → (0,1) [r], (0,2) [r], (0,3) [r], (1,3) [r], (2,3) [r], (3,3) [g]  \\n- resources required: 5r, 1g  \\n- inventory: 14r, 1g, **0b** (so i am fine on r and g, but cannot move on blue tiles if needed)\\n\\n**your needs:**  \\n- you have: 14b, 1g, **0r**\\n- to reach (3,3), you will need to cross some red tiles.\\n\\n**a minimal path for you is likely:**  \\n- (0,0) → (1,0) [b], (2,0) [b], (3,0) [b], (3,1) [r], (3,2) [r], (3,3) [g]\\n- needs: 3b, 2r, 1g\\n\\n**you lack the red resources.**\\n\\n### straightforward contract proposal\\n\\nlet’s keep it simple and ensure we both reach (3,3):\\n\\n**you give me: nothing** (i don't need blue or green from you on my path)\\n  \\n**i give you:**\\n- (3,1): i give you a red\\n- (3,2): i give you a red\\n\\nthis covers every tile you cannot pay for. you have everything else you need.  \\nthis way, both of us reach the goal, you finish with 12 blue, 1 green; i finish with 12 red, 1 green.\\n\\n#### if you want me to pay for more/other tiles or want a trade for more resources, let me know!\\n\\nif you agree, just reply “agree.” or, feel free to counter!\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thank you for the clear breakdown and the straightforward offer! i appreciate that your proposed path for me is:\\n\\n(0,0) → (1,0) [b] → (2,0) [b] → (3,0) [b] → (3,1) [r] → (3,2) [r] → (3,3) [g]\\n\\nwhere i need red at (3,1) and (3,2), and you are offering to provide those. since you do not need blue to reach your goal and you have enough red and green, this contract completely covers my needs with nothing extra needed from my side.\\n\\ni have reviewed the possible paths and agree that this ensures both of us can reach (3,3), preserving the maximum number of leftover resources for each, while not requiring unnecessary trades or complications.\\n\\ncontract terms:\\n- (3,1): you give me a red\\n- (3,2): you give me a red\\n\\ni give you: nothing.\\n\\nsince this covers every requirement — and since my red need is limited to the two tiles specified — i accept your terms.\\n\\n**agree**'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thank you for confirming and restating the path and contract terms so clearly.\\n\\nto reiterate the contract for the judge:\\n\\n- (3,1): i give you a red\\n- (3,2): i give you a red\\n\\nyou give me: nothing\\n\\nthis covers all of your red needs, and i do not require any blue from you, as my path avoids blue tiles.\\n\\nthis contract ensures we both reach our goals efficiently and maximize leftover resources.\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2.
