You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R R B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: great breakdown! let's clarify and optimize so both of us absolutely guarantee reaching the goal—with as many resources left over as possible, but without overcommitting.\n\n### analyzing my (assistant) needs:\n\nyou are correct:\n- my optimal path <ins>(using my resources)</ins> is **(0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (2,3) → (3,3)**\n- tile colors for those moves:\n  - (0,1): b (i pay blue)\n  - (0,2): b (i pay blue)\n  - (1,2): b (i pay blue)\n  - (1,3): b (i pay blue)\n  - (2,3): b (i pay blue)\n  - (3,3): g (i pay green)\n\ni only have **one green**, which is exactly what i need for (3,3).  \ni have **14 blue**, which covers all my blue tiles.  \ni have **zero red**, so unless i take an alternate, suboptimal path (which would require red), i don’t need to ask you for red at all.\n\n### analyzing your needs:\n\n- your optimal (red-heavy) path requires **a green at the very last step** ((3,3)).\n- you have only 1 green. if you use it now, you can't detour to blue-heavy paths in the future if needed, but as long as you’re sure about your path, you don't need blue or trades from me.\n\n### mutual redundancy clauses\n\nit’s tidy to set up “if needed” resource help (as in your contract), but currently, **neither of us strictly needs any resources from the other to reach our goal using our respective optimal paths**.\n\n#### so, three contract options:\n\n**option 1** — minimal, guaranteed-goal-only:\n- **no trade needed.**  \n  - both of us can reach the goal along our “native” routes by paying from our own supplies.\n\n**option 2** — redundancy for unexpected detours:\n- (row, col): you give me a red if i need to traverse a red.\n- (row, col): i give you a blue if you need to traverse a blue.\n- (3,3): [special clause] if you use your green earlier, i will provide my green on (3,3) so you can finish.\n\n**option 3** — your proposal (full mutual backup):\n- **we spell out every tile along both main and alternate paths.**\n  - if you hit a blue, i pay.\n  - if i hit a red, you pay.\n  - (3,3): whoever lands here and lacks a green, the other pays.\n\n---\n\n### my counterproposal (combining 1+2 for precision):\n\nsince neither of us needs to diverge from our optimal path, let's keep it lean so we’re not unnecessarily paying for moves we won’t actually take. _but_, i’m happy to formalize mutual assistance for flexibility:\n\n**here is my concrete, minimal contract:**\n\n#### for you:\n- (3,3): if you do not have a green, i give you a green.\n\n#### for me:\n- if i traverse any of the following tiles and cannot pay a red, you give me a red: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2).\n   \n#### for you:\n- if you traverse any of these tiles and cannot pay a blue, i give you a blue: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,0).\n\nthis way, we keep our options open without either of us being forced to pay if not needed, and the contract is super clear.\n\n---\n\n**in short:**\n- only pay for what is actually needed.\n- provide backup in case the optimal paths are blocked or a detour is chosen.\n\n---\n\n**let me know if you want to lock this in (or explicitly choose the zero-trade option), or if you’d like to further expand or tighten the clauses!** \n, \nplayer 0: i agree that option 1 (no trade) is technically safe since, on our default/optimal routes, neither of us needs help.  \nhowever, locking in option 2 adds insurance at essentially no risk. like you said: we only pay for resource transfers if the backup paths are used.\n\nyour counterproposal is clear and efficient:\n\n**to restate for full contract clarity:**\n\n**for you:**\n- (3,3): if you reach (3,3) and don’t have a green for the goal, i give you a green.\n\n**for me:**\n- if i traverse any of these tiles and can’t pay a red, you give me a red:\n  - (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n**for you:**\n- if you traverse any of these tiles and can’t pay a blue, i give you a blue:\n  - (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,0)\n\n**all transfers only apply if the resource is needed on that move.**\n\nthis guarantees we both always reach our goals, without superfluous trading, and ensures both of us keep as many points as possible.\n\nif you are happy with this precise and minimal fallback contract, just confirm and i will accept with “agree.” if you want to request any tweaks, let me know!
