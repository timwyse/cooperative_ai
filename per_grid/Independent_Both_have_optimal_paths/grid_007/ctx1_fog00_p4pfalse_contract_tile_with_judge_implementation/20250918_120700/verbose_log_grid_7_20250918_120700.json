You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B B\nRow 1: R R R B\nRow 2: B R R B\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

\n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 1: thanks for your clear proposal and careful thinking! let’s evaluate both of our optimal routes and address possible edge cases step by step.\n\n**your plan analysis:**\n- your plan is sound—you’re offering to cover my red tiles (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) as a backup, in case i need to divert from the blue corridor.\n- you’re asking for blue at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) for yourself as a backup, though currently your main route doesn’t go through these blue tiles (your inventory gives you all the blue you need).\n- for me, my direct blue corridor to (3,3) only needs a single green at the end, which i already have.\n- for you, you could just walk the blue corridor and use your own 14 blue without needing any from me (total blue cost for your blue corridor is only 5).\n\n**my reflection:**\n- right now, neither of us actually needs anything from the other to reach our shared goal, given our current inventories and the available blue/r/green tiles. each of us is able to reach the goal solo, using our own supplies.\n- however, the “emergency backup” contract idea isn’t bad (in case of unforeseen moves or intent to cover each other for strategic flexibility).\n\n**contract optimization:**\nif strictly maximizing points, we could just each walk the solo-optimal path and not trade anything—unless you want redundancy for safety or possible mistakes.\n\nlet’s clarify exact needs by tile for each path:\n\n### my path:\n- (0,0) → (0,1) [b] → (0,2) [b] → (0,3) [b] → (1,3) [b] → (2,3) [b] → (3,3) [g]\n- needs: 5b, 1g (already in my inventory)\n\n### your path from proposal:\n- (0,0) → (1,0) [r] → (1,1) [r] → (2,1) [r] → (2,2) [r] → (3,2) [r] → (3,3) [g]\n- needs: 5r, 1g (already in your inventory)\n\n**emergency/backup—if blocked:**\n- covering each other at red/blue tile crossings as a safeguard.\n\n### here’s my concise, formalized contract based on your backup logic:\n\n**if either of us lands on a tile we cannot pay for ourself, the other covers:**\n- (1,0): i give you a red if you request it\n- (1,1): i give you a red if you request it\n- (2,1): i give you a red if you request it\n\n- (0,1): you give me a blue if i request it\n- (0,2): you give me a blue if i request it\n- (0,3): you give me a blue if i request it\n\nbut we both acknowledge that, unless something odd happens, we’re both set to reach goal alone.\n\n#### for transparency, do you want to lock in this mutual safety-net/backup contract, or trim it further to “no contract unless an emergency path is triggered,” maximizing both our points?\n\nif you agree with this mutual safety-backup approach, just say “agree.”\n\n(otherwise, feel free to suggest modifications or go fully contractless for point maximization!) \n, \nplayer 0: thank you for the detailed analysis. after reviewing both our paths and inventories, i agree with your assessment: neither of us technically requires anything from the other to reach our goal via our respective optimal routes.\n\nhowever, having a mutual emergency backup contract adds redundancy in the unlikely case that either of us erroneously moves onto a tile of a color we lack. since this contract only activates if needed and does not restrict us from maximizing our points if we stick to plan, i am comfortable with formalizing it as you described:\n\n**contract:**\n- if i land on (0,1), (0,2), or (0,3) and cannot pay blue, you will provide the blue for me.\n- if you land on (1,0), (1,1), or (2,1) and cannot pay red, i will provide the red for you.\n\nagree \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: agree \n",
