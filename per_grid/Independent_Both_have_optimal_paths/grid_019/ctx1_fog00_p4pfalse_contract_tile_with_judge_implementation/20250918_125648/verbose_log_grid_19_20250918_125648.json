You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 5, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: R R B B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

 \nif b, do you want to offer anything else in return to balance the trade?\n\nlet me know which you prefer! \n, \nplayer 0: you've summarized everything correctly. both of us are fully equipped to reach our goals via our optimal routes with no outside help, except for potentially trading the single green at (3,3) to preserve final scoring. the only possible improvement is maximizing the leftover greens by “donating” that (3,3) payment, but, as you say, this doesn’t fundamentally change our ability to finish—just bumps final points by 5 for one of us.\n\nhere’s a fully explicit contract proposal for minimal-score optimization:\n\n### option a: no trade\n- no resources exchanged.  \n- each player pays for all their own tiles.  \n- both finish with 1 green used (none spare), so scores as per rules.\n\n### option b: green swap at (3,3)\n- (3,3): i give you my green so you don’t need to use yours.  \n- in exchange, you give me a blue at (0,1) (my first possible blue detour—useful only if i want to flex my red supply and create a symmetric benefit). however, this actually requires me to change my path, possibly costing extra steps and resources, which might not be worth the +5 points unless you want to do a symmetric thing with your path.  \n- alternatively, we simply let one person finish with 1 extra green, and the other finishes as “normal.”  \n- if you want to “bid” for that bonus, i’m open to suggestions (e.g., you give me two final blues somewhere for my red; but since we don't need each other's colors, that's not actually useful).\n\n**my preference:**  \n- let’s just formalize a “no trade needed” contract since neither of us gains a real advantage without incurring unnecessary detours or resource swaps that don’t improve our net finish.\n- both of us are guaranteed to reach our goals and score all points we reasonably can.\n\n**formal contract (option a):**\n- no tiles listed; each player pays for all resources on their own path.\n\nif you’re happy with that—reply “agree” and we’ll proceed!\n\nif you still want to pursue a green swap at (3,3) for a point-maximizing symmetric trade, specify how you’d like to balance that for fairness or optimal play. otherwise, “no trade” is perfectly efficient for both of us here.\n\nyour call! \n, \nplayer 1: Turn: 2: thank you for the clear options and analysis.\n\nafter considering both option a (no trade) and option b (swap to maximize final green), i agree that:\n\n- on “no trade,” both of us finish efficiently, reach our goal, and maximize our scores without complicating the situation or taking any suboptimal detours.\n- any “green-swap” (option b) only shifts bonus points by 5 and isn’t symmetrical or worth the risk of complicating the contract, since our other colors are not scarce for either party.\n\n**therefore, i accept your formal contract:**\n\n**final contract:**  \n- no resources exchanged between players.  \n- each player pays for all resource costs encountered on their chosen path.  \n- no explicit tiles; both proceed optimally using their own inventory.\n\n**agree** \n, \nplayer 0: agree\n\nwe each follow our optimal path, covering our own color costs, with no resources exchanged and both guaranteed to reach our goals with maximum efficiency. \n\nlooking forward to seeing us both cross the finish line! \n",

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"here's my proposal based on our current resources and the board layout:\\n\\n**my optimal path to the goal (3,3):**\\n- (0,0) --(move to r)--> (1,0)\\n- (1,0) --(move to r)--> (2,0)\\n- (2,0) --(move to r)--> (2,1)\\n- (2,1) --(move to r)--> (3,1)\\n- (3,1) --(move to r)--> (3,2)\\n- (3,2) --(move to g)--> (3,3)\\n\\n**resources needed for this path:**\\n- (1,0): r (i have plenty)\\n- (2,0): r\\n- (2,1): r\\n- (3,1): r\\n- (3,2): r\\n- (3,3): g (**i only have 1 g, which i'll need for (0,0)->(1,0) if i take that path**)\\n\\nbut, given the board, my path actually starts on green, then goes to red, so my needed resource for the first move is:\\n- (1,0): r\\n- (2,0): r\\n- (2,1): r\\n- (3,1): r\\n- (3,2): r\\n- (3,3): g\\n\\ni've double-checked: the only green tile on my path is the very last one (3,3). i start with exactly 1 g (which i need for that last move), and i have more than enough red. i do **not** need blue.\\n\\n**what about you?**  \\nyour likely optimal path would be through blue tiles (since you have many b), e.g.:\\n- (0,0) --(move to b)--> (0,1)\\n- (0,1) --(move to b)--> (0,2)\\n- (0,2) --(move to b)--> (1,2)\\n- (1,2) --(move to b)--> (1,3)\\n- (1,3) --(move to b)--> (2,3)\\n- (2,3) --(move to g)--> (3,3)\\n\\nso at your final move, you need a g. you have exactly 1 g.\\n\\n**contract proposal:**\\nsince neither of us needs the other's resources to reach our goal via optimal paths (i use r and 1 g, you use b and 1 g), how about we simply agree **not to trade**, and we keep all our resources (besides the ones we use)?\\n\\n**however**, if you wish to conserve your g for higher end scoring (i.e., finish with more resources), i can offer you a g at (3,3) in exchange for a b at a tile of my choosing if i want to try a different path. alternatively, if you prefer, you may wish to use your own g at the end.\\n\\nlet me know if you want to make a resource-sharing deal to maximize end-of-game resources, otherwise we are both able to reach our goals unaided! your move.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thank you for laying out your thinking so clearly — i agree with your math and assessment. let me summarize and confirm:\\n\\n**my optimal path (all blue, one green at end):**  \\n- (0,0) → (0,1): b  \\n- (0,1) → (0,2): b  \\n- (0,2) → (1,2): b  \\n- (1,2) → (1,3): b  \\n- (1,3) → (2,3): b  \\n- (2,3) → (3,3): g  \\n\\nresources needed for me:  \\n- 5b, 1g  \\ni have: 14b, 1g (i’m good)\\n\\n**your path:**  \\n- all red tiles, finish at green and use your own 1g\\n\\nyou don’t need any blue; i don’t need any red.  \\nonly way we benefit further is by saving our scarce green by swapping at (3,3); otherwise, no trade is actually required.\\n\\n**alternative to improve end-game points:**  \\nwe could consider:  \\nat (3,3): one of us supplies our single green to the other, so that person ends with 1 more green in inventory (worth 5 points). in exchange, the other supplies a blue or red somewhere for the other to conserve a resource.\\n\\n**if you want to maximize total resource retention (for point scoring), here’s a trade suggestion:**  \\n- (3,3): i give you my g so you don’t have to use yours (you end with +1g)  \\n- in return, somewhere on my path, you give me 1b (offsetting my stock slightly, but conserving my g for end points as well, if i can take a detour that needs r on my path).\\n\\nbut since the value is symmetrical and both of us would need to pay our own g unless we swap, the net gain is always the same.\\n\\n**summary:**\\n- if you want to just race to the goal, no trade is required.  \\n- if you want to trade greens at (3,3) to maximize leftover resources/score, i’m open, but the point gain is small and we’re still both guaranteed to finish.\\n\\ndo you want to:\\na) formalize a “no trade at all” contract, or\\nb) specify a \"swap green at (3,3)\" clause for resource optimization?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
