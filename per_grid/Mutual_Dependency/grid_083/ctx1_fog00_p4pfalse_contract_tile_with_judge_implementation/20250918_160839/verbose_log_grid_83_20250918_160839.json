You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 2, 'R': 3, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B B R\nRow 1: B B B R\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thanks for starting! let\\'s look at the situation:\\n- i have a lot of red (\"r\") and only 1 green (\"g\"), 0 blue (\"b\").\\n- you have a lot of blue (\"b\"), 1 green (\"g\"), and 0 red (\"r\").\\n- we both want to reach (3, 3).\\n- the fast, resource-cheap path for both of us requires the colors the other possesses.\\n\\n**here’s my step-by-step optimal path and what i need from you:**\\n\\n**path:**  \\n(0,0) – (1,0): **b**  \\n(1,0) – (2,0): **b**  \\n(2,0) – (2,1): **r**  \\n(2,1) – (2,2): **r**  \\n(2,2) – (3,2): **r**  \\n(3,2) – (3,3): **g**\\n\\n**what i lack:**  \\n- i need **2 blue** resources at (1,0) and (2,0).\\n\\n**likely, you’ll want my red for your path.**\\n\\n**proposal:**  \\n**i trade you red on the tiles where you need them; you trade me blue on my needed tiles.**  \\nlet’s make it one-for-one on each needed tile:\\n\\n### my requests:\\n- (1, 0): you give me a blue  \\n- (2, 0): you give me a blue\\n\\n### what i offer in return (presumed for you to take the same path mirrored, but you specify your path):\\n- i will give you red at two tiles you specify that require red.\\n\\n**proposed contract:**  \\n- (1, 0): you give me a blue  \\n- (2, 0): you give me a blue  \\n- (your two specified tiles requiring red): i give you a red at each\\n\\nplease specify which two tiles you want red from me (likely (2,1) and (2,2)), or adjust the terms as needed!\\n\\nlet me know your thoughts, any tweaks, or confirm your tiles and we can finalize!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: great summary and analysis! i agree our paths and shortages fit very nicely for a direct swap.\\n\\nlet me clarify step-by-step where i’d need your red, and confirm the contract in detail.\\n\\n**my optimal path** (matching the “estimated best path” in my info):  \\n(0,0) → (1,0): **b** (i pay, or with your help on your request)  \\n(1,0) → (2,0): **b** (i pay, or with your help on your request)  \\n(2,0) → (3,0): **b** (i pay)\\n(3,0) → (3,1): **b** (i pay)\\n(3,1) → (3,2): **r** (**i need help here!**)  \\n(3,2) → (3,3): **g**\\n\\n**where i need red from you:**  \\n- (3,1) → (3,2): **r**\\n- *(i need a second red!)*  \\nmy best (and shortest) path actually requires me to use two reds, at (2,1) and (3,1). but looking at the actual tile layout, on my route (all columns along row 3), only (3,1) → (3,2) is red; earlier i use only blue up to (3,1).  \\ncorrection: **my “needed red” tiles are only (3,1) → (3,2)**.  \\nbut your path uses (2,1) → (2,2) and (2,2) → (3,2) as reds—do you intend to pay for both yourself, or do you want help at both?

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
