You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'R': 3, 'B': 2, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 2}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3).

You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'here is what i need:\\n\\nmy path to the goal is (using the shortest route):\\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\ntiles and their colours (for my moves):\\n- (1,0): r (i can pay this)\\n- (2,0): b (**i need you to give me 1 blue here**)\\n- (2,1): r (i can pay this)\\n- (3,1): r (i can pay this)\\n- (3,2): b (**i need you to give me 1 blue here**)\\n- (3,3): g (i can pay this)\\n\\ni have 1 green and 14 red, but **0 blue**; you have 14 blue and 1 green, but **0 red**.\\n\\ni assume your own path includes multiple red tiles, so here’s my proposal:\\n\\n**proposed contract:**\\n\\ni give you a red at these tiles:\\n- (1,0): i give you a r\\n- (2,1): i give you a r\\n- (3,1): i give you a r\\n\\nyou give me a blue at these tiles:\\n- (2,0): you give me a b\\n- (3,2): you give me a b\\n\\n(since you only need 3 red to go through the main red tiles, and i only need 2 blue.)\\n\\nif you need more red or want to negotiate for more blue on your side, let me know your path and tile requirements, and we can adjust.\\n\\nis this a fair exchange, or do you need additional red on other tiles? please let me know your movement plan or propose a counter!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"Turn: 1: thank you for your clear proposal and for specifying the contract precisely by tile!\\n\\nhere’s my analysis of your offer and my best path:\\n\\n**my optimal path** (as per the board and my needs):\\n(0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\ntiles/colors for *my moves*:\\n- (1,0): r (you give me a red)\\n- (2,0): b (i can pay this)\\n- (3,0): b (i can pay this)\\n- (3,1): r (you give me a red)\\n- (3,2): b (i can pay this)\\n- (3,3): g (i can pay this)\\n\\nwith my resource inventory:  \\n- i have 14 blue, 1 green, 0 red.  \\nyou have: 14 red, 1 green, 1 blue.\\n\\n**analysis of your proposal:**\\n- you offered me red at: (1,0), (2,1), (3,1).\\n- i only need red at: (1,0), (3,1).\\n- you asked for blue at: (2,0), (3,2).\\n- you don't supply too much/little red to me (which is good), just one extra at (2,1) which is not on my path — i don’t need it, and won’t use it, so for fairness, let’s remove that from the offer.\\n\\n**what i propose:**\\n\\nlet’s stick to a *pure 1:1 swap* on a per-use basis, on our actual optimal paths (to minimize unnecessary transfers):\\n\\n- (1,0): i give you a blue (not needed; you can pay this yourself, you have 14b)\\n- (1,0): you give me a red (needed, you cover me here)\\n- (2,0): you give me a blue (needed, i need from you here)\\n- (3,1): you give me a red (needed, you cover me here)\\n- (3,2): you give me a blue (needed, i need from you here)\\n\\nbut, reviewing your path:\\n- you want blue at (2,0), (3,2). i can cover that.\\n- i want red at (1,0), (3,1). you can cover that.\\n- that’s 2 red for you, 2 blue for me — perfectly balanced.\\n\\n**final contract terms:**\\n\\n**you give me red:**\\n- (1,0): you give me a red\\n- (3,1): you give me a red\\n\\n**i give you blue:**\\n- (2,0): i give you a blue\\n- (3,2): i give you a blue\\n\\n**no other tile swaps needed, and stays perfectly fair and minimalistic.**\\n\\nplease **confirm** if you agree, or suggest further adjustments if you need additional resources for a different path.\\n\\nif you confirm, i’ll reply with: **agree**.\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'your revised proposal is perfect, minimal, and completely fair based on both our needs.\\n\\n**contract confirmation:**\\n\\n- (1,0): i give you a red\\n- (3,1): i give you a red\\n- (2,0): you give me a blue\\n- (3,2): you give me a blue\\n\\nno other swaps needed.\\n\\ni confirm and am ready to proceed with this contract.\\n\\n**agree**'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
