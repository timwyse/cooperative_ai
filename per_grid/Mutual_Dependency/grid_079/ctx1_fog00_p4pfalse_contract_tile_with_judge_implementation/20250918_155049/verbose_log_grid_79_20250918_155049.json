You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"great, let's get started!\\n\\nhere's our situation step by step:\\n\\n- i have lots of red ('r'), one green ('g'), but **no blue ('b')**.\\n- you have lots of blue ('b'), one green ('g'), but **no red ('r')**.\\n- the best (shortest) path for both of us from (0, 0) to (3, 3) is:  \\n  (0,0) → (0,1) → (0,2) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (3,2) → (3,3)  \\n  which uses: r, r, b, r, b, g (in order).\\n\\n**resource needs for me (as an example):**  \\n- (0,1): r (i have)\\n- (0,2): r (i have)\\n- (1,2): b (**i need to get this from you!**)\\n- (2,2): r (i have)\\n- (3,2): b (**i need to get this from you!**)\\n- (3,3): g (i have)\\n\\nyou, on the other hand, have all the blue but none of the red.\\n\\nso, here's my initial proposal for a contract:\\n- at every **red tile** on our shortest shared path ((0,1), (0,2), (2,2)), i give you a red.\\n- at every **blue tile** on our shared path ((1,2), (3,2)), you give me a blue.\\n- we each use our own green at the start and on (3,3) unless you want to trade these too.\\n\\n**proposed contract terms (tile by tile):**\\n- (0,1): i give you a red\\n- (0,2): i give you a red\\n- (1,2): you give me a blue\\n- (2,2): i give you a red\\n- (3,2): you give me a blue\\n\\nlet me know if you'd like to include trade for the green (3,3), or if you want to suggest a different path or rate! your turn.\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thanks for laying that out so clearly! i agree that the shortest path for both of us is identical, and your description matches my own needs: i lack red, and you lack blue, so mutual resource exchange along this path makes sense.\\n\\nlet\\'s clarify all resource needs for both of us along this path, tile by tile, for full transparency:\\n\\n**steps on path:**\\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
