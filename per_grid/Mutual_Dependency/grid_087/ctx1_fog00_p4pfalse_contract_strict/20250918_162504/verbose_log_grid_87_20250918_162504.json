A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B B R B\nRow 2: R R B R\nRow 3: B B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 0) to (3, 0)\nYou said: from your position (2,0):\n\n**possible moves:**\n- (3,0): b (blue)\n- (2,1): r (red)\n- (1,0): b (backwards, already visited)\n\n**goal path:** (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) gets you to the goal.\n\n**resources needed for (3,0):**\n- (3,0) is blue.\n- you have 12 blue (plenty).\n- no need for contract for this tile.\n\n**other options:**\n- (2,1) is red. you have 0 red, but contract covers this if you'd needed it later, but it’s not optimal now.\n\n**conclusion:** move forward toward the goal on the main path. move to (3,0).\n\n**answer:**  \n3,0\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 0) to (3, 1)\nYou said: from your position (3,0):\n\n**board row 3:**  \n(3,0): b  \n(3,1): b  \n(3,2): r  \n(3,3): g  \n\n**possible moves:**\n- (3,1): blue (contract says you pay for the other if they move here, doesn't specify they pay for you)\n- (2,0): r (backwards, not toward goal)\n\nyou have 10 blue.\n\n**best path:** (3,0) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\n\n**resources for next step:**\n- (3,1) is blue, you have plenty.\n\n**conclusion:**  \nmove to (3,1).\n\n**answer:**  \n3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 11}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: from your position (3,1):\n\n**possible moves:**\n- (3,2): red\n- (2,1): red (not toward goal)\n- (3,0): blue (backward)\n\n**resources:**  \nyou have 0 red, but your contract states:\n\n> (3,2): {'giver': 'the other player', 'receiver': 'you', 'color': 'red'}\n\nso if you move to (3,2), the other player pays the red cost for you.\n\n**conclusion:**  \nyou can move to (3,2) this turn.\n\n**answer:**  \n3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1.

For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
