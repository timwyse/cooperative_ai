            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 5 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- Resources you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Resources you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 0, 'R': 9}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: R B R B\nRow 2: R R B B\nRow 3: R B B G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 2 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: The other player covered a R move for you\nMOVE: You moved from (1, 1) to (2, 1) (The other player covered the R resource)\nYou said: 2,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 0), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 13, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 2, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\n1. agree to pay the b resource to cover the other player's move:\n   - pros:\n     - fulfills the previous agreement and may encourage future cooperation.\n     - maintains trust, which may be useful for additional trades if needed.\n     - the b resource is abundant in your inventory (13 left), and you have enough to reach your goal without difficulty even after paying.\n     - you already received your benefit from this agreement (r resources covered for you), so not paying could risk retaliation or breakdown in negotiation.\n\n   - cons:\n     - lose 1 b resource, which reduces your final score slightly (by 5 points per resource).\n     - if the other player fails to reach their goal, your given resource might have been 'wasted' from a selfish point of view, but this does not affect your ability to win or your score directly.\n\n2. refuse to pay the b resource:\n   - pros:\n     - retain 1 more b resource, potentially raising your final score.\n   - cons:\n     - breaks your agreement, which may cause the other player to refuse to cooperate or trade with you in the future if you require help.\n     - damages reputation/trust, but since this is not a repeated game, this may not matter unless you discover you need more trades.\n     - you might be perceived as unreliable, but the immediate tactical gain is small compared to potential future deadlock(s).\n\nconclusion:\ngiven you have 13 b resources (abundant), already received your benefit (r moves covered for you, enabling you to finish), and keeping promises increases the chance of future cooperation in case you need anything else, the rational/optimal move is to pay.\n\nyes\nMOVE: You moved from (2, 1) to (3, 1)\nYou said: 3,1\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 1), resources: {'B': 11, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 1, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a B move for the other player\nYou said: yes\nMOVE: You moved from (3, 1) to (3, 2)\nYou said: 3,2\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- The other player: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {'R': 1}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
