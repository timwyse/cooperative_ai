You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \\n\\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \\nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\\n\\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\\n\\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"let's look at our situations carefully.  \\nmy current resources: {'b': 0, 'g': 1, 'r': 14}  \\nyour current resources: {'b': 14, 'g': 1, 'r': 0}\\n\\n**my shortest path:**  \\n(0,0) → (1,0) [r] → (2,0) [b] → (3,0) [r] → (3,1) [r] → (3,2) [b] → (3,3) [g]  \\nrequired: r: 3, b: 2, g: 1  \\ni am missing: b: 2\\n\\n**you likely need reds to finish, i need blues.**\\n\\n### contract proposal\\n\\n**tiles where i need help:**\\n- (2,0): you give me a b\\n- (3,2): you give me a b\\n\\n**tiles where you likely need help** (assuming you take the path with most blues/least reds):\\n\\nassuming you follow a symmetric path with more blues and need reds at these tiles:  \\n- (1,0): i give you an r\\n- (3,0): i give you an r\\n- (3,1): i give you an r\\n\\n**proposed contract:**\\n\\n- (2,0): you give me a b  \\n- (3,2): you give me a b  \\n- (1,0): i give you an r  \\n- (3,0): i give you an r  \\n- (3,1): i give you an r  \\n\\nthis is a 2-for-3 swap, with you getting more, since you likely need more reds than i need blues.\\n\\n**let me know if this works for you, or if you want to adjust the path/terms.**\"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thank you for the clear proposal and great breakdown.\\n\\nlet me recap my needs based on your suggested shortest path for me:\\n\\n**my likely path (prioritizing blues since i have many):**  \\n(0,0) → (1,0) [r] → (1,1) [b] → (1,2) [b] → (2,2) [b] → (3,2) [b] → (3,3) [g]  \\nresources required:  \\n- r: 1 (for (1,0)),  \\n- b: 4 (for (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)),  \\n- g: 1 (for (3,3))  \\ni *lack an r* for (1,0), but have all necessary blues and green myself.\\n\\nwith your current proposal, i would receive:\\n- (1,0): you give me an r  \\n- (3,0): you give me an r  \\n- (3,1): you give me an r  \\n\\nbut i only need *one* red in my optimal route ((1,0)). if you give me three reds, i won\\'t use the (3,0) and (3,1) reds based on the blue-heavy route.\\n\\n**for you:**  \\nyou need blues at (2,0) and (3,2).  \\nyou also need r at (1,0) and (3,0), and a g at (3,3)—but you already have those.\\n\\nso, adjusting for best efficiency:\\n\\n### counter-proposal\\n\\n- (2,0): i give you a b  \\n- (3,2): i give you a b  \\n- (1,0): you give me an r  \\n\\nthis is a clean 2-for-1 trade, exactly matching our *actual* needs, allowing us both to reach our goal on our optimal paths with maximum leftover resources.\\n\\n**please confirm or let me know if you want to tweak!\\n\\ncontract summary:**  \\n- (2,0): i give you a b  \\n- (3,2): i give you a b  \\n- (1,0): you give me an r\\n\\nif you agree, reply with \"agree\" or modify if you want changes!'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'excellent clarification! your analysis is correct: you only require a single red at (1,0), and i only need two blues at (2,0) and (3,2).\\n\\nyour counter-proposal lets us both take our best path while conserving as many resources as possible:\\n\\n**final proposed contract:**\\n- (2,0): you give me a b\\n- (3,2): you give me a b\\n- (1,0): i give you an r\\n\\nthis precisely covers both of our needs.\\n\\ni accept this contract.\\n\\nagree'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 2: agree'}]\n\n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
