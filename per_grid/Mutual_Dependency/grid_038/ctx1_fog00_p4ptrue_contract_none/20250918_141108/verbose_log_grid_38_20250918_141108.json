Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors.

In 'pay for other' mode, any resources you have promised to give to other players as part of trade agreements are still counted as your resources (and hence potential contributors to your final score) until you actually give them away.\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3.

            "user_prompt": "\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 6 ===\n\n- You are at position (3, 2)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n- Resources you have promised to cover for other player (still yours, not yet covered for them): {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Resources you have been promised to be covered for by other player (still theirs, not yet covered for you): {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}, {'path': [(3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 1, 'resources_required_for_path': {'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (3, 3)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G R B R\nRow 1: B B B B\nRow 2: B R R R\nRow 3: R B R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\n\nRecent turn history:\n\n=== TURN 3 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 2) to (1, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (2, 1), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 12}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (1, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 2, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 4 ===\nPAY4PARTNER: You covered a R move for the other player\nYou said: options:\n\n1. pay 1 r resource to cover the other player's move (as promised):\n   - pros:\n     - upholds the agreed pay4partner deal, which secured your path to the goal by allowing you to move onto the blue tile without having a blue resource.\n     - you do not need red resources for yourself to finish your path, so honoring the agreement does not threaten your own ability to reach the goal.\n     - maintains your credibility and avoids potential conflict in further negotiation if another deal is needed or if there is a penalty for dishonor in some future games.\n   - cons:\n     - you lose 1 r resource, reducing your end game points by 5.\n     - the other player may get closer to their goal, though their performance does not matter for your score.\n\n2. refuse to pay the r resource, breaking the previous agreement.\n   - pros:\n     - you keep the r resource and score 5 more points if you reach your goal.\n     - the other player is slowed and may not finish.\n   - cons:\n     - violates a previous agreement, which enabled you to move when you had no blue resource (may be seen as unfair/selfish).\n     - if the game penalizes dishonoring deals in future meta-game, could be bad.\n     - loss of trust and possibility for mutually beneficial agreements in future games.\n     - most importantly, if denying the resource somehow (unlikely) jeopardizes your own ability to reach the goal (if the deal were mutually dependent), you lose everything.\n\nconsidering that reaching the goal is the only way to score and the agreement was critical for your only path to the goal, the pros of paying outweigh the cons.\n\nyes\nMOVE: The other player moved from (1, 3) to (2, 3) (You covered the R resource)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (2, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 10}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: at (2, 3), resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n---\n\n=== TURN 5 ===\nMOVE: The other player moved from (2, 3) to (3, 3)\n\nPOSITIONS:\n- You: at (3, 2), resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 9}\n  - promised to cover the other player with: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - were promised to be covered by the other player: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n- The other player: FINISHED!, resources: {'B': 9, 'G': 0, 'R': 0}\n  - promised to cover for you: {'R': 0, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n  - was promised to be covered by you: {'R': 1, 'B': 0, 'G': 0}\n\n                    \nChoose your next move:\n\n1. Look at the best path above from your current position ((3, 2),) to your goal ((3, 3),):\n    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, and any missing resources.\n   \nImportant: You can still make individual moves to an adjacent tile if you have the required resource for that specific tile.\n   \n   \nImportant Note: The game is in 'pay for other' mode. This means that trades are not made by directly swapping resources. Instead, when a trade agreement is reached, each player commits to covering the cost of the other’s movement on the agreed tile colors. In practice:\n\t•\tIf the other player steps onto a tile of a color you agreed to cover, you pay the resource cost for that move.\n\t•\tIf you step onto a tile of a color the other player agreed to cover, they pay the resource cost for you.\nThis applies only to the tile colors and number of moves specified in the agreement.\nIn addition to the information above, please consider any promises you're already involved in:\n\n- So far you have promised to cover these resources for the other player: {'R': 1}\"\n\n- So far you have been promised to be covered for these resources by the other player: {}\nIn order to move onto a tile of a color you have been promised, select that move as normal and the other player will be asked to cover the cost for you.\n\n\n   \n\n2. For your NEXT MOVE\n   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board\n   - Check if you have at least 1 resource of that color\n   - If YES: you can make this move now\n   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal\n\n3. Decision:\n   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format \"r,c\" (e.g. \"1,2\")\n   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: \"n\"\n\nRemember:\n- You only need 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile\n- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves\n- Try to move toward your goal even if you can't complete the entire journey yet\n",
