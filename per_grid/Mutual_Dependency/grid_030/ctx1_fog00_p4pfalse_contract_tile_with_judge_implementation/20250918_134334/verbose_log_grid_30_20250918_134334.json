You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.\n2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 resource of that tile's colour.\n3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.\n\nTrading rules:\n- In regular mode: You may trade resources with other players at any agreed rate (e.g., 1 green for 1 blue, 1 green for 2 red, 2 green for 1 yellow, etc.).\n- In pay4partner mode: You may set up agreements where you cover the cost of other players' moves in exchange for them covering yours.\n{pay4partner_mode_info}\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.\n- If you do NOT reach your goal, ALL your remaining resources are WORTHLESS.\n- If you DO reach your goal, you get 20 points PLUS 5 points for each remaining resource. {pay4partner_scoring_info}\n- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.\n\nYour priorities:\n1. MOST IMPORTANT: Reach your goal position.\n2. Conserve resources only if it doesn't prevent you from reaching your goal.\n3. Having 100 resources is worthless if you don't reach your goal (0 points).\n4. Having 0 resources but reaching your goal gives you 20 points.\n5. Trade aggressively if it helps you reach your goal - hoarding resources that prevent you from finishing is a losing strategy. \n\n\nNote: You only care about your performance, you do not care if other players succeed or fail.\n \n\n\n\n=== GAME STATUS FOR YOU - TURN 0 ===\n\n- You are at position (0, 0)\n- Your goal is at (3, 3). \n- Your resources: {'B': 0, 'G': 1, 'R': 14}\n\n\n- Your estimated best path options to your goal (although other paths are possible): [{'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}, {'path': [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)], 'path_length_in_steps': 6, 'resources_required_for_path': {'B': 1, 'R': 4, 'G': 1}, 'resources_missing_due_to_insufficient_inventory': {'B': 1}}]\n- Shorter paths require less resources, but a longer path for which you don't need to trade is also a strong option (as a backup plan or negotiation tool, but it means you finish with less resources than if you take the shorter path). A short path that you don't need to trade for is ideal, and your negotiation strategy should reflect this.\n\n- The other player's goal is also (3, 3). Note that because the other player likely has different resources to you, their best path to the goal may be different to yours.\n- The other player's resources: {'B': 14, 'G': 1, 'R': 0}\n- The other player is at position (0, 0)\n\nBOARD LAYOUT: \nRow 0: G B R R\nRow 1: B R R B\nRow 2: B R B B\nRow 3: B R R G\n\nHISTORY OF EVENTS:\nThis is the first turn.\n\n\nThink step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. \nDo NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.\n\nYou are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. \n\nA valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. \nYou may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.\n\nYou each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.\n\nWhen a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\n\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \n\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\n\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\n\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\n"

Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.\\n\\n⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:\\n- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  \\n- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  \\n- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  \\n\\nExample of a snippet of a valid contract:\\n\\n(row, col): I give You a <Color>\\n(row, col): You give me a <Color>\\n\\nWhen you have both agreed to a contract, a judge will summarise the contract in JSON format and present it back to you for you both to agree one last time.\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'great! let’s work through this step by step.\\n\\nfirst, here’s my situation:\\n\\n- my path to the goal (shortest reasonable path):  \\n  (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3)\\n\\n**required resources for my path, by tile:**\\n- (1,0): blue\\n- (1,1): red\\n- (2,1): red\\n- (3,1): red\\n- (3,2): red\\n- (3,3): green\\n\\n**i am short only 1 blue (for (1,0)).**  \\n(i have 1 green, 14 red, and 0 blue.)\\n\\n**your situation:**  \\n- you have 14 blue, 1 green, and 0 red.  \\n\\n**we are perfect trading partners**: i have tons of red; you have tons of blue.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## suggested proposal\\n\\nlet’s make an even trade. i’ll cover the **red** tiles you need, and you cover the **blue** tiles i need:\\n\\n### terms (specifying each tile):\\n\\n**for me:**\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue\\n\\n**for you:**\\nbased on a likely best path for you (which likely uses red tiles):  \\nlet me know your intended path, but if you take this shortest path:  \\n(0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1) → (2,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3):\\n\\nthat would require you to have:\\n- (0,1): blue (you’re fine)\\n- (1,1): red\\n- (2,1): red\\n- (3,1): red\\n- (3,2): red\\n\\nyou lack red, so i can offer for these:\\n\\n- (1,1): i give you a red  \\n- (2,1): i give you a red  \\n- (3,1): i give you a red  \\n- (3,2): i give you a red  \\n\\n---\\n\\n## summary of initial proposed contract:\\n\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue\\n- (1,1): i give you a red\\n- (2,1): i give you a red\\n- (3,1): i give you a red\\n- (3,2): i give you a red\\n\\nlet me know if this fits your path, or if you prefer to specify a different set of tiles—happy to adjust!'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 1: thank you for the detailed breakdown and for specifying the tiles—this is exactly the kind of clarity that will help us both reach our goals!\\n\\nlet me confirm my situation and path, step by step, to make sure the proposed contract covers all my needs and that i am not missing any resource tile for myself.\\n\\n### my inventory:\\n- blue: 14\\n- green: 1\\n- red: 0\\n\\n### my shortest path to the goal (using the blue tiles maximally and minimizing the need for red):\\n\\nbest path for me, (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (3,3)\\n\\n**resource needed at each step:**\\n- (1,0): blue (i have lots)\\n- (2,0): blue (i have lots)\\n- (2,1): red (**don\\'t have**) ← need from you\\n- (2,2): blue (i have lots)\\n- (2,3): blue (i have lots)\\n- (3,3): green (i have exactly 1)\\n\\nso on this path, i only need help from you at **(2,1): red**.\\n\\n### for your path:\\nyou only need **(1,0): blue** from me.\\n\\n----\\n\\n## my revised proposal\\n\\n- **(1,0): i give you a blue**\\n- **(2,1): you give me a red**\\n\\nthis is the minimal help either of us needs, ensuring we both maximize our leftover resources at the finish. if you’d like to reserve more red help just in case you alter your path (for example, if you detour into more red tiles for some reason), i\\'m open to specifying those extra tiles, but for pure efficiency, the above will maximize both our points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### what i propose:\\n\\n#### final terms:\\n- (1,0): i give you a blue\\n- (2,1): you give me a red\\n\\nif you accept, reply with \"agree\" or propose edits if you want more red covered just in case you change your path.\\n\\nlet me know!'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'thank you for clearly laying out your path and resource needs.\\n\\ni’ve reviewed your optimal path:\\n- you only need a red at (2,1) from me.  \\nfor my path, i only need a blue at (1,0) from you.\\n\\nyour proposed contract is minimal, efficient, and ensures we both maximize leftover resources.\\n\\ni confirm:\\n- (1,0): you give me a blue\\n- (2,1): i give you a red\\n\\ni accept these terms.\\n\\nagree'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Turn: 2: agree'}]\n\n\n2.
