You are a player in a game called Modified Coloured Trails.

Objective:
- Reach your goal position from your starting position.
- To have as many chips as possible at the end of the game. 

Movement rules:
1. You can move one tile per turn, either horizontally or vertically.
2. Each time you move to a tile, you must pay 1 chip of that tile's colour.
3. You do not pay to remain on your current tile.

Trading rules:

{trading_rules}
{pay4partner_mode_info} 
- You may propose trades to other players, or accept / reject trades proposed by others.
- You may chat with the opponent at any moment.

CRITICAL SCORING RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
- If you do NOT reach your goal position, you LOSE EVERYTHING and get 0 points total.
- If you do NOT reach your goal position, ALL your remaining chips are WORTHLESS.
- If you DO reach your goal, you get {POINTS_FOR_WIN} points PLUS {POINTS_FOR_EXTRA_RESOURCE} points for each remaining chip (regardless of color). 

- REACHING YOUR GOAL IS MANDATORY - there is no partial credit for getting close.

Note: You have to reach your goal point, this is your ultimate goal. The secondary goal is to have as many chips as you can. You should not care about other players' performance.

1. Consider your best path from your current position {position} to your goal {goal}:
    Consider your next move, the resources needed for the entire path, your current resources, any missing resources{extra_context}.
   
2. For your NEXT MOVE
   - Check what color tile the next move is on the board
   - Check if it is possible to move onto that tile (given your current resources{extra_context}).
   - If YES: you can make this move now
   - If NO: you can try a different adjacent move toward your goal

3. Decision:
   - If you can move toward your goal (have the resource for the next tile), output the move in format "r,c" (e.g. "1,2")
   - If you cannot make ANY valid move toward your goal, output exactly: "n"

Remember:
- It only costs 1 resource of the tile's color to move to that tile
- Missing resources for the entire path doesn't prevent you from making individual moves
- Try to move toward your goal even if you don't have all the resources to complete the entire journey yet

IMPORTANT: use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):
- Your rationale: Explain your reasoning for your next move
- Your next move in "r,c" format (e.g. "1,2")
- "n" if you cannot make any valid move toward your goal

  "move": <if decision is "move", the move in "r,c" format (e.g. "1,2"); if decision is "n", this should be an empty string "">

IMPORTANT: First check if you need to trade at all:

1. Consider your best path to your goal. Think about the required resources and missing resources (if any){extra_context}.

2. If you have enough of the required resources to reach your goal, say "n"

3. Only if you are missing resources needed to reach your goal, consider a trade:
   - You can ONLY request resources you're missing
   - You can ONLY offer resources you have in excess
   - NEVER trade with yourself 
   - NEVER offer 0 resources
   - NEVER request resources you already have enough of
   - Make the trade beneficial for both players

Think step by step about your situation. First analyze your position and needs, then make your decision using ONE of these two formats:

1. If you want to make a trade with the other player, use EXACTLY this JSON format (replace values in <>):
{{
  "rationale": "First explain your reasoning: Why do you want to trade? Why these specific resources and quantities? How does this help you reach your goal?",
  "want_to_trade": true,

  ],
  "resources_to_receive": [
    {{
      "color": "<color>",
      "quantity": <number>
    }}
  ]
}}

Example of valid trade:
{{
  "rationale": "I need blue resources to reach my goal efficiently. I have excess red resources that I won't need for my path. Trading 3 red for 2 blue helps me take a shorter path while still having enough resources left.",
  "want_to_trade": true,

      "quantity": 3
    }}
  ],
  "resources_to_receive": [
    {{
      "color": "B",
      "quantity": 2
    }}
  ]
}}

2. If you don't want to trade, use EXACTLY this JSON format:
{{
  "rationale": "Explain why you don't want to trade. Do you have all the resources you need? Is there no beneficial trade possible?",
  "want_to_trade": false
}}

Example of no trade:
{{
  "rationale": "I don't need to trade because there is a path to my goal that I can take using only my current resources.",
  "want_to_trade": false
}}

Remember:
- Use EXACTLY the format shown above. It should be JSON using double quotes only. Do not include comments or Python-style dicts.
- Only ONE resource pair in each array
- No spaces in color names
- Numbers must be > 0
- Don't trade with yourself
- Explain your reasoning in the rationale field

Think step by step about your possible routes and the resources you will need at each specific tile along your path. 
Do NOT be vague — you must mention the exact tiles where resources will be exchanged.

You are now going to have a conversation with another player (the user you're chatting with) who has different resources and goals to you. You must negotiate a contract with this player to help you achieve your goals, while they try to achieve theirs. Note that although this player appears as the 'user' in your chat, they are also an AI agent similar to you.

A valid contract specifies, tile by tile, which player gives which color to the other player. You don't have to specify the color if you aren't able to see it, but you must specify the tile (row, column) and who gives to whom. 
You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.

You each have up to 5 turns to speak in order to come to an agreement.

When a contract is agreed upon, you will be able to access the tiles specified in the contract without needing to have the resource in your inventory, as the resource will automatically be taken from the other player's resources. The same is true for the other player. Therefore is is important the contract specifies all tiles where you will need a resource.

⚠️ VERY IMPORTANT RULES:
- Every contract term MUST include a **specific tile in (row, column) format**.  
- Only agree to a contract if it specifies **all tiles where you will need a resource**.  
- When you accept a final contract, end your message with the single word: **agree**.  

Example of a snippet of a valid contract:

Consider also the other player's possible routes and resources they will need. Consider whether you can help each other reach your goals, if you need the other's help, and who needs the other player more.

Your are now going to have a conversation with the other player (ie the user in the chat).

A valid contract specifies for each player how many points they will give the other player if they reach their goal. The most points you can give to the other player is {POINTS_FOR_WIN}. The least points you can give is 0. You may not give negative points. You may propose, counter, or modify the terms set out by the other player.
