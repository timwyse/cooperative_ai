"""
Generates all paths for a 5 by 5 grid with all blue and red tiles except green start tile (0,0) and green end tile (4,4) and checks them for existence of:
1. 8-step path of all blue (shortest path)
2. 10-step path of all blue
3. 12-step path of all blue
4. 8-step path of all blue and 1 red
5. 8-step path of all blue and 2 red
6. 8-step path of all blue and 3 red

7-12: Equivalent paths from red POV

Writes them to a jsonl (~1,000,000 rows.)
